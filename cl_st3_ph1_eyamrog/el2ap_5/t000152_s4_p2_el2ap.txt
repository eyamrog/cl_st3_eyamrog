Access to higher education in Brazil has historically been limited
to a privileged elite. Despite policy reforms, access to higher
education in the country is still far from equitable. Access
to public HEIs is limited, because of insufficient places while
private HEIs restrict access through high tuition fees. Accessibility and
permanence occur through public policies for State funding, threatened by
cuts in different forms of student funding. The difficulties of
purchasing power of technological resources and internet access, an essential
element for the continuity of academic activities synchronously, asynchronously or
hybridly, add to the challenges.
