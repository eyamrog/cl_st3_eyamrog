Among the health conditions that require continuous care, at the
PHC level, prenatal care, diabetes and hypertension are prominent. In
December 2019, the Ministry of Health launched a reform of
the Brazilian PHC in order to improve access and efficiency
in the sector 23. A set of indicators was presented,
linked to payment for performance 23, 24 aimed at monitoring
these conditions. However, due to an initial rule of transition
between the different payment models and, subsequently, the declaration of
a state of pandemic in the country, the resources linked
to the Performance Pay Program (P4P) were guaranteed in their
entirety, with the PHC being exempt from presenting the results
of the indicators25. These factors already demonstrate the great difficulty
of the Brazilian PHC model with the quality of the
services provided. Data presented in this study corroborate the difficulty
of achieving better results and the scenario presented by the
pandemic is adding to this challenge 26.
