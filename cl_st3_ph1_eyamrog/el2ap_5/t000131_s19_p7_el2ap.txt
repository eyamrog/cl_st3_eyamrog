Stomatal index (SI) and stomatal density (SD) both increased according
to the increased levels of radiation (table 2). The highest
SI and SD values were observed at 150 DAT for
both species under I0 and I25. In M. glomerata grew
under I0, SI and SD were 18.05% and 256 stomata/mm2,
respectively, while for M. laevigata developed under I0, SI and
SD were 14.41% and 176 stomata/mm2, respectively. Regardless of the
solar radiances level, M. glomerata showed the highest values of
SI and SD when compared to M. laevigata.
