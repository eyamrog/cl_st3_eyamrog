Gas exchange parameters, chlorophyll fluorescence, and photosynthetic pigment content were
evaluated after 60, 90, 120, and 150 days after the
treatments started (DAT). Leaf anatomy and biomass production were evaluated
at 90 and 150 DAT. Three leaf samples per plant
from upper, middle and lower canopy regions were collected.
