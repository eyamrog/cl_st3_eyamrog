The study was carried out in the drylands in the
Middle Valley of Rio Negro and surrounding areas (38ยบ50 'to
39ยบ55' S: 65ยบ15 'to 66ยบ35' W), (Fig. 1). In general,
the surveyed area is used for extensive cattle production, mainly
for breeding. Establishments with feedlots are scarce in this rainfed
area (Klich et al. 2020).
