It was concluded that the frequency of enteroparasitosis in indigenous
school- children belonging to the Guarani ethnic group, in a
village in the State of Paran√°, Southern Brazil, was high
and did not decrease after the mass treatment of the
population with anthelmintic medication. The mass treatment regimen with ABZ,
adopted as the only control measure, was not effective against
enteroparasites in these school-children, and the benefits for the community
in the long-term require sanitary improvements and additional educational programs
in order to prevent reinfection by intestinal protozoa, although geo-helminth
infections were no longer detected after the adoption of the
treatment strategy.
