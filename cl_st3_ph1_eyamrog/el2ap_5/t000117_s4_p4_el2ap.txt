The third aspect regards the effects of the emergence of
the learning society in the reports by Edgar Faure and
by Jacques Delors, in the LDBEN 9.394/1996 and in the
interview with Noah Webster Sobre, underlining deep changes in the
contemporary social tissue with regards to the educational field. Among
them, we highlight the spreading of educational spaces as a
counterpoint to school spaces. Another change, related to the previous
one, regards the deterritorialization\demmuring of school spaces, in the sense
that learning can and should take place in ambiances such
as open spaces, gardens, parks, woods, squares etc. And, finally,
the deepest change regards the meeting between ICTs and education,
radicalized by the COVID-19 pandemic. That is, remote teaching at
a distance9 or online teaching. The classrooms with their four
concrete walls have been replaced by virtual “classrooms”, which, despite
still employing terms such as Google Classroom, perhaps mark a
definitive break in the way we conceive the learning and
teaching space-ambiances. We do not mean that the schooling institutions
will be wholly replaced by Google Classrooms, and equally we
are not making an apology of online teaching, but only
pondering that, perhaps, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated a deep
cleavage in contemporary society, i.e., the de-schooling of society, together
with the demmuring and dematerialization of this secular teaching institution.
