The Board represents the collective decision-making body responsible for keeping
the strategic direction of the NPO. In other terms, it
is responsible for the definition of guidelines that support NPO's
practices and business, and whose main function is to establish
a link between cause and management – according to Fama
and Jensen (1983), Jensen (1993) and Jensen and Meckling (1995).
Operationally, the construct Board involves elements that relate to its
constitutive aspects (election, mandate, independence and committees) and attributions (approval
of CEO’s compensation and the Annual Report).
