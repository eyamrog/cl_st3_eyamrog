Saminathan et al. (2014) suggest that thalli immersion in liquid
detergent (0.5% for 10 minutes) followed by 1% povidone iodine
for 30 seconds reduces bacteria and eliminates zooplankton and ciliates
on Gracilaria dura (C.Agardh) J.Agardh. In our study, 1% povidone
iodine was not efficient to eliminate ciliates and zooplankton (e.g.
microcrustaceans) on the algal surface, maybe the effective decontamination found
by Saminathan et al. (2014) was caused by a longer
thalli immersion time in detergent (10 minutes).
