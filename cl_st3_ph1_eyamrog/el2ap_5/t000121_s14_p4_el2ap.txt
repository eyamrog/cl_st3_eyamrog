The worry levels were assessed using the Meta-Worry Questionnaire (MWQ),
developed by Wells (2005). The Portuguese version of the MWQ
was adapted and validated by Dinis and Gouveia (2011), with
good internal consistency (α = 0.89). The instrument includes seven
items, in the form of questions, assessed separately on two
scales that assess the frequency of metacognitions about worry and
the degree of beliefs related to them. In the present
study, only the scale that evaluates the frequency of worry
was used, due to the intention to conduct a brief
mental health screening and, therefore, the need for the smallest
possible research instrument. Answers are obtained using a 4-point Likert
scale, ranging from “never” (1) to “always” (4). The score
is obtained by adding the answers of all items, indicating
that the higher the frequency of worry, the greater the
probability of being dysfunctional. In this investigation, the instrument showed
high internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha [α] = 0.90).
