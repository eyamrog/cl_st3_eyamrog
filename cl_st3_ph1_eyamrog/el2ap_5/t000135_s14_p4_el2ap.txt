The confounding variable evaluated in the present study was the
population size of municipalities, which was obtained from the Brazilian
Institute of Geography and Statistics and categorized as a) ≤
20,000 inhabitants; b) 20,001 to 50,000 inhabitants; c) 50,001 to
150,000 inhabitants; d) > 150,000 inhabitants 11. Data relating to
coverage by the Family Health Strategy and Oral Health Teams
were collected monthly (Proportion -%) at the municipality level. They
were obtained from the information and management of primary care
databases and were categorized as follows: a) absent (0%); b)
incipient (< 30%); c) intermediate (30 - 70%); and d)
consolidated (≥ 70%). Municipalities with an HDI below 0.55 were
classified as low HDI, between 0.55 and 0.699 as average
HDI, between 0.70 and 0.799 as high HDI and with
HDI of 0.80 or more as very high. The Gini
index (collected from the databases of the United Nations Development
Program, http://www.atlasbrasil.org.br/2013/) was used continuously in the model. Brazil is
geopolitically divided into five regions, namely: Southeast, South, Midwest, North
and Northeast. The proportion of physicians and nurses per 10,000
inhabitants for 2020 was collected from the National Register of
Health Establishments (CNES), human resources section. Additionally, we calculated the
rate of basic health units per 10,000 inhabitants.
