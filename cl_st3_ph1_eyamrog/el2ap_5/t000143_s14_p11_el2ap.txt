Multiple spatial regression was performed in the last analysis phase.
The quality of the fit of the spatial regression model
is similar to the traditional linear regression model, verified by
the residual analysis and also based on the Moran I
index 22. The following criteria were used to include or
remove variables from the model: 1) Selection of the variable
with the highest statistical correlation; 2) Inclusion of variables that,
when analyzed together, obtained a higher F in the simple
regression analysis; This inclusion does not prevent variables from the
same block from being included as “adjustment variables”, regardless of
their association. 3) Inclusion of variables that, once in partial
correlation, controlled by modeled variables, showed significant correlation with the
dependent variable. The final model exclusion criteria for the variables
were the value of p ≥0,05. The software used was
Stata 11.0, SPSS 18.0 and GeoDa 0.95-i.
