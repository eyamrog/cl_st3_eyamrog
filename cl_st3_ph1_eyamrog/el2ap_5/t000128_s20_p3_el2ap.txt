The decoction did not inhibit the strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae,
E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosas, and Salmonella Typhimurium. These bacteria are
Gram-negative and present structures at the cell wall, as the
outer membrane, composed by lipids and lipopolysaccharides (TORTORA; FUNKE; CASE,
2012) that may hinder the entrance of hydrophilic molecules present
in the decoction.
