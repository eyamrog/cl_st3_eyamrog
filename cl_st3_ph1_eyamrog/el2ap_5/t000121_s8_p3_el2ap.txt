Widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, are associated
with psychological distress and symptoms of mental illness. Most existing
studies were conducted in China, the first epicenter of the
pandemic as we write, and observed mainly anxiety disorders such
as common mental disorder (CMD) associated with COVID-19 occurrence in
different countries (Huang & Zhao, 2020). In this sense, evidences
from previous studies on events similar to COVID-19, such as
MERS-COV and SARS-COV, show that measures to separate and restrict
the flow of people have a massive impact on mental
health, causing negative psychological outcomes such as CMD (Brooks et
al., 2020; Jiloha, 2020). Symptoms of stress, irritability, insomnia, post-traumatic
stress disorder, depression, anxiety, substance abuse, suicide attempts, and self-injury
behaviors are frequently observed in health care professionals and in
the general population who, in this type of stressful situation,
worry about uncertainties regarding the future, intensely fear of the
risks of contagion and death (Brooks et al., 2020; Faro
et al., 2020). In a study including 1210 participants, higher
rates of anxiety and depression were associated with women, students,
people with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, and those with poor
health perceptions, while availability of information and engagement in preventive
behaviors such as washing hands seemed to soften these effects
(Wang et al., 2020).
