Evaluation of The Natural Regeneration of Plant Species - when
monitoring the experimental unit, it was observed that, from the
treatment implementation period (October 12th, 2017) to the second collection
of samples (July 12th, 2018), there was massive growth of
Urochloa brizantha (Hochst. Ex A. Rich.) R. D. Webster on
all plots, and there was no germination of seedlings of
shrub/arboreal plant species and other weeds.
