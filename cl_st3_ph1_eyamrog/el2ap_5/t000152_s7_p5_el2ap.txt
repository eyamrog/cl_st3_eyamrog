Pressure from business groups coupled with the effect of a
speech by Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro which promoted vertical rather
than horizontal isolation (meaning that only risk groups needed to
self-isolate and others could continue their activities, go to work
and participate in the economy) conflicted with the preventive measures
adopted by certain governors and mayors. Without effective control over
the movement of people and with the reopening of non-essential
activities, COVID-19 infections surged. Many cities and municipalities adopted the
most stringent social isolation measures in order to prevent Intensive
Care Units (ICUs) being inundated beyond their coping capacity (Mendonça
2020). The duration of the pandemic is undefined and its
impact on the economy and on the lives of the
citizens has been prolonged. This paper considers the impact of
COVID-19 on student access and retention in higher education, especially
among low-income groups.
