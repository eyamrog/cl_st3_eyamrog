We recorded a total of 74 species of herpetofauna (distributed
in four orders), being 38 amphibians (37 anurans and one
caecilian; Table 1) and 36 reptiles (three chelonians, one amphisbaenian,
nine lizards, and 23 snakes; Table 2) at the PNT.
Hylidae was the amphibian family with the highest species richness
(N = 10 species), followed by Brachycephalidae (N = 5)
and Cycloramphidae (N = 5) (Table 1). With the exception
of Gymnophthalmidae, with two species, all lizard families were represented
by only a single species. The snake family Dipsadidae was
represented by 14 species, and Colubridae by five (Table 2).
During our field surveys we recorded a total of 3,288
individuals in Sector A of the Parque Nacional da Tijuca,
during the 36 months of the study period, representing a
total of 49 species. Most (3,174) of these individuals were
amphibians (Table 1), belonging to 24 species of the orders
Anura (N = 23 species) and Gymnophiona (N = 1)
(Figures 2-4). We recorded only 114 reptiles, although these individuals
also represented 25 species (Table 2), distributed in two orders,
Chelonia (N = 2) and Squamata (N = 23) (Figures
5-7). Two of these amphibian species and 11 of the
reptiles were recorded opportunistically during the study period (i.e., not
during standardized surveys; Tables 1 and 2).
