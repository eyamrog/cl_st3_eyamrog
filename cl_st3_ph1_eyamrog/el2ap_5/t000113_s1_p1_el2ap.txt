Affirmative policies arise from the need to favor some sectors
of society that have suffered or continue to suffer from
the effects of discrimination, injustice, racism, or exclusion; among these,
in Special Education, students with gifted characteristics have become invisible
to teachers, guardians, and society in general. However, the trinomial
gifted-black-female presents threefold invisibility in our world. This study analyzes
the factors that trigger the invisibility of gifted black women
in Brazilian schools. We use descriptive statistics to analyze the
microdata collected by surveys, evaluations, and exams carried out by
the National Institute of Educational Studies and Research.
