This species was described by Hustedt (1952: 392, fig. 99-100)
as Cocconeis pulcherrima and later on transferred to Achnanthes pulcherrima
by Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot (1998: 18, pl. 69, fig. 9-14,
pl. 70, fig. 1, 4, p. 366, pl. 66, fig.
1-9). However, that transference was considered not valid because the
basionym was not mentioned (Coste et al. 2010). Due to
the presence of a cavum (rimmed depression at the valve
central area), which is a distinguishing character for species in
the genus, it was later transferred to Planothidium by Coste
et al. (2010). It was present in just 2% of
the core samples, and reached 1% maximum abundance. It occurred
in samples that corresponded to the end of the Mid-Holocene
(~5.479 cal. yr BP). This is the first record of
the presence of this species in Brazil using its correct
name, and the first citation for the species occurrence in
the Brazilian Amazon.
