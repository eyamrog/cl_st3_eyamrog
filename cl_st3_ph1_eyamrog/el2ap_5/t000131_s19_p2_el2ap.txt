Net photosynthetic rate (A) from both Mikania species was significantly
affected by solar radiance levels and species. However, no interactions
between factors were observed for A (figure 1 e-f). Compared
with plants grown under high solar radiances, a lower A
was observed in plants grown under the greatest shading (I75)
in both species (figures 1 e-f). At 150 DAT and
under I75, A showed the lowest values and was 6.7
and 4.5-fold lower than plants under I25, in Mikania glomerata
and Mikania laevigata, respectively. On average, in M. glomerata and
M. laevigata, the highest A (12.69 and 14.87 Âµmol m-2
s-1, respectively) was observed in plants grown under I25 compared
with other treatments (figure 1 e-f). During the entire experiment,
the lowest A and gs values were observed at 150
DAT, period with low air relative humidity, highest vapor pressure
deficit (VPD), and increased air temperature (supplementary material table S3).
