The methodology proposed by Engel et al. (2017) was adapted
in order to evaluate the surface disinfectant effects. Plastic, steel,
and ceramics surfaces were washed and sterilized for use. Afterwards,
the surfaces were left in contact with the inoculum in
a concentration of approximately 108 UFC/mL during 30 minutes for
biofilm formation. Posteriorly, the disinfectant solutions were sprayed at 100
mg/mL and control product, for 15 minutes, in an area
of 1 cm3. Then, the samples were collected with a
sterilized swab, and the number of microorganisms was quantified by
the plate count technique (TORTORA; FUNKE; CASE, 2012).
