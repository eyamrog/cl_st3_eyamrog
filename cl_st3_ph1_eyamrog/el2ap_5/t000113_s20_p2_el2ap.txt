In this text, the terms giftedness and talent (D&T) will
be considered equivalent to what the National Council of Education
of Brazil (Resolução, 2001) calls high abilities/giftedness (AH/SD). Abandoning the
official nomenclature was, on the one hand, due to the
inaccurate terminology translation and the need to consider the talent
development process. At first, it thinks of giftedness as the
possession and use of outstanding natural capabilities anchored biologically and
informally developed (Gagné, 2018), placing the person among the top
10% of their peers. And, in a second moment, talent,
considered as the mastery of these skills from a systematic
development - or competencies - that manifest themselves in at
least one field of human activity that allocates the person
among the 10% most outstanding in their specialty (Gagné, 2013a).
