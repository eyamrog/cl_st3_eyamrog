This paper analyzes of the influence of governance, considering its
respective dimensions, over the donations with donor restrictions received by
environmental NPO in Brazil. The results of the study present
evidence that NPO with better governance have easier access to
donations. Moreover, certifications issued by the Brazilian government to NPO
did not moderate the relationship between governance levels and donations
received.
