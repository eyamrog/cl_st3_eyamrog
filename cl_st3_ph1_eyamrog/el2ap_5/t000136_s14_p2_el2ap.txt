We chose as units of analysis NPO of the environmental
sector with operations in Brazil. By delimiting the study to
an area of activity and a geographic field of action,
in an operational cutting, we contribute for the homogeneity of
the units of analysis in all selected NPO. At the
same time, aspects related to the relevance of the social
object promoted by environmental NPO strengthen this option.
