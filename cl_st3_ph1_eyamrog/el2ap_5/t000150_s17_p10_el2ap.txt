But something happened from the end of the twentieth century:
the migration of those Naichis and Okinawans to Japan (not
to Okinawa, in Japan). In these new streams, the flowing
of this entire Nikkei population to Japan (either descending from
Naichis or Okinawans, or spouses with no bloodline) put them
before a society resistant to the difference, experiencing intense racism
and prejudice. This experience of painful processes eventually diminished (or
mitigated) the internal differences between Okinawans and Naichis, constituting Brazilian
communities in Japan that crossed the dividing lines in Brazil.
