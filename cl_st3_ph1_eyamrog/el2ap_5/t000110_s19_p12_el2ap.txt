This variety is quite similar to Eunotia rabenhorstii Cleve &
Grunow var. triodon Cleve & Grunow (1881: 12a), but, having
a single undulation on the dorsal margin is unique for
the var. monodon Cleve & Grunow (Patrick & Reimer 1966,
Costa et al. 2017b). The species was rare, occurring in
just 2% of the core samples, reaching 1% maximum abundance.
It is found in samples from the Late Holocene (~408
cal. yr BP). This is the first report of the
occurrence of the variety monodon in the Brazilian Amazon.
