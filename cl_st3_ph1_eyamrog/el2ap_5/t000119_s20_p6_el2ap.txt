In soil salinity situations, the soil faces water potentials that
hinder water absorption required for germination. The imbibition with accumulation
mainly of sodium chloride can cause the rupture of the
tegument seed layers, causing damage to the embryo and, consequently,
the death of the embryos (Freitas et al. 2013). Salinity
effects are the results of complex interactions among morphological, physiological,
and biochemical processes including seed germination, plant growth, and water
and nutrient uptake (Akbarimoghaddam et al. 2011). Salinity affects almost
all aspects of plant development including: germination, vegetative growth and
reproductive development (Bano & Fatima 2009).
