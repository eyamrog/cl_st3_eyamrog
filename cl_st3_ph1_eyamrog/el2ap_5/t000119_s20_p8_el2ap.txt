The findings of our research corroborate with those observed by
Cavalcante et al. (2019) in rice seeds (Oryza sativa L.),
where root growth was negatively affected by NaCl, especially at
higher concentrations (up to 0.6 MPa). This reduction was also
observed by Dalchiavon et al. (2016), in studies on the
effect of saline stress on common bean seeds (Phaseolus vulgaris
L.), where increased saline concentration caused a reduction in root
growth, hindering their normal development. In addition, Oliveira and Silva
(2019) verified reduction of shoot and root growth of common
bean seedlings and decreased fresh and dry seedling biomass even
in small salt concentrations (0.1 MPa), demonstrating that this species
has low tolerance to salt stress caused by KCl.
