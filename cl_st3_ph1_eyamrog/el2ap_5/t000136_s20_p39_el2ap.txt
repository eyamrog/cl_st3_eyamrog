It is possible to associate the identified relationships to the
process of marketization (Salamon, 1997), according to the findings of
Lacruz et al. (2019). To deal with the donations market
constraints, NPO have increasingly adopted private-for-profit market approaches, leading to
what Salamon (1997) termed as ‘the non-profit private sector marketization’.
Thus, NPO extended their external responsibility, and had to show
results in terms of efficiency and effectiveness (Arvidson and Lyon,
2014), besides adopting management models for this purpose (Smith, 2010).
