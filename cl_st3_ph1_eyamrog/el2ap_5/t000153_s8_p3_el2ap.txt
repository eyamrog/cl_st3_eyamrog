When women and girls seek access to legal abortion in
Argentina today, they face barriers imposed by both professionals, through
their attitudes toward abortion, and the institutional culture. Examples of
such barriers are the following: women are not provided with
information in a clear or complete way, or what they
are told is not based on evidence; they experience delays
of all sorts; they are required to either have a
legal permit or mediation by ethical committees is imposed; they
are asked to undergo unnecessary medical examination, among other examples
of impediments to accessing an abortion.
