Among the new possibilities, one stands out: the idea that
it is possible to learn in spaces never before considered
adequate for learning (Coutinho & Lisbôa, 2011). For Colombian researcher
Ernesto Noguera-Ramírez (2009, p. 13), “the passage into a society
of knowledge places the ‘educated person’ at the center” of
knowledge. Knowledge is no longer the monopoly of schooling institutions,
but the responsibility of all subjects. In the learning society,
a diversity of spaces, including virtual spaces, can become learning
ambiances, provided the individuals are able to govern themselves; in
such societies it is up to the individuals to continually
learn in the course of their entire lives.
