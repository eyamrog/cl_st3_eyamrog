We will now study the performances of each individual Brazilian
Institution in every year. To measure the general performance of
each Institution, we will use the average of the Dimensions
as a parameter to classify the Universities, instead of the
standard “Olympic Medals Table” used by the “U-Multirank” of considering
only the number of A. Tables 2 to 5 show
the performances of each Brazilian University for every year in
the range 2017-2020. It is showed the average of all
the Indicators, the average of the Indicators of each Dimension
and the average of the Dimensions, using all the data
available.
