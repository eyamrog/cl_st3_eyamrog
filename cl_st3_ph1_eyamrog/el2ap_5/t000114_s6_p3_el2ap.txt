A large number of species (46%) was recorded occurring on
terricolous substrate, in fact, it is common to find bryophytes
colonizing along the roadside with increasing altitude (Frahm 2003) and
even with the increased occurrence of exposed rocks. Even though
our collections were carried out mainly along partially open trails,
we find a diversity of habitats along these paths providing
us with a considerable representativeness of species, including diverse substrates.
