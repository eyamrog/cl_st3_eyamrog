One important question that has yet to be answered regards
the original occurrence of the tortoise Chelonoidis carbonarius in the
state of Rio de Janeiro. This species was originally described
by Spix (1824) from specimens obtained from the region of
the Amazon River. Pritchard and Trebbau (1984), Vanzolini (1994), Ernst
and Leuteritz (1999) and Vargas-Ramírez et al. (2010) described the
geographic distribution of the species in Brazil, and in particular,
indicated its absence in the state of Rio de Janeiro.
While a number of studies have indicated the presence (e.g.,
Rocha et al. 2004, Köhler 2008) or possible occurrence (Tozetti
et al. 2017) of C. carbonarius in Rio de Janeiro,
it is difficult to establish whether this region was part
of the original distribution of the species, or whether its
occurrence in the region (if confirmed) is due to the
deliberate release into the wild of animals raised as pets
or for food.
