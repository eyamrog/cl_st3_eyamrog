We understand that both the reports coordinated by Faure (1973)
and by Delors (1998) focus on an education yet to
come and yet to take place; both insist on the
need of displacing learning from the spaces and time reserved
for schooling into something continuous, that takes place not exclusively
in school, but at all times, everywhere. Learning should not
be a space-time experience sited and territorialized into a single
human being-crafting moment and within the school institution, but should
instead become the way of life of subjects in contemporaneity.
This idea of displacement of time-space is central, because each
individual will know how to â€œconduct his or her destiny,
in a world where the speed of change couples with
the phenomenon of globalization as it modifies the relations that
men and women keep with space-time (Delors et al., 1998,
p. 104).
