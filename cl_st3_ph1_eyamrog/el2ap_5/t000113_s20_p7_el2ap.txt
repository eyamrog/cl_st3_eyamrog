It is necessary to review historically female education to understand
the legitimizing myths influencing D&T invisibility. It was characterized by
the supremacy of men over women as the patriarchal family,
especially during the colonial stage. Ribeiro (1987) points out that
at that time, the formal education of women was considered
a social heresy both in Portugal and in Brazil. The
woman was kept in seclusion and considered an inferior being
with the sole function of being the generator of the
men who preserved male hegemony. It led to an immense
mass of illiterate women in the colony. Thus, it is
not surprising that nowadays, among students with D&T indicators, the
invisibility of women is even more evident. The consequences of
inequity and injustice, based on these legitimizing myths, impact the
perception of teachers, students, and guardians of the characteristics of
these students. This historically differentiated education and the lack of
successful female role models have negatively influenced women's self-esteem in
the case of the "imposter syndrome" when they attribute their
success to everyone or everything but themselves (Freitas & Perez,
2016).
