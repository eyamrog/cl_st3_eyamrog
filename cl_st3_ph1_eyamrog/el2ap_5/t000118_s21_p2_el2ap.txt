Epiphytic plants, 0.8-1.7 m tall when flowering. Leaf rosettes infundibuliform.
Leaf-sheaths 23 × 9- 14 cm, broadly elliptic, dark-brown; leaf-blades
36-72 × 5.5-7.5 cm, linear-lanceolate, green with some darker and
tenuous transversal stripes, apex acute-attenuate, mucronate. Peduncle 50-63 cm long,
erect, green or reddish towards the apex; peduncle bracts imbricate,
the lower ones green, foliaceous, suberect, with sheaths ca. 5
× 6.5 cm, broadly-ovate, blades ca. 40 × 5.5 cm,
narrowly triangular, becoming smaller towards the apex, the upper ones
with dilated sheaths, ca. 6 × 7 cm, orbicular, reddish,
blades suberect to patent, ca. 10 × 3 cm, lanceolate,
green, apex attenuate, mucronate. Inflorescence compound, heterothetic double raceme, erect,
35-100 cm long; branches 10-21, sometimes bracts with undeveloped branches
at base and in the middle portion of the inflorescence,
branches 13-30 cm long, usually patent with an ascending to
slightly sigmoid apical portion, flowers (8-)10-20; primary bracts generally longer
than the peduncles of branches but shorter than the branches,
4.5-12 × 6-8 cm, the lower ones distinctively bigger, similar
to the bracts of the peduncle, with sheaths ca. 7
× 8 cm, reddish, dilated, blades 10 × 3 cm,
lanceolate, green, patent, becoming smaller towards the apex, the upper
ones shorter than the peduncle of the branches, ca. 4.5
× 6 cm, orbicular, red, apex mucronate, without blades; peduncle
of branches 2-8.5 cm long, each one with a sterile
bract, the lower branches with up to 2 sterile bracts,
similar to the floral bracts, ca. 3.5 × 2.2-4 cm,
carinate; rachilla red or reddish-green, slightly geniculate, internodes 0.8-1.1 cm
long in the flowering branches and up to 2.2 cm
long in the fruiting branches. Floral bracts 2.1-3.5 × 2-3
cm, orbicular to broadly-ovate, almost completely embracing the base of
the rachilla, apex obtuse, apiculate, carinate, red, equaling the length
of sepals or only those in the distal portion of
the branch red with a yellow apex and shorter than
the sepals, suberect and imbricate before anthesis, subpatent and spaced
after anthesis, exposing the rachilla. Flowers distichous, suberect in anthesis;
sepals ca. 2.5 × 1 cm, narrowly ovate, yellow, apex
acute, mucronate, not carinate; petals ca. 3.2-3.5 × 0.7 cm,
ligulate, yellow, slightly orange at the apex, apex rounded, petal
appendages 2, bilateral to the antepetalous filament, longitudinally adnate to
the petal for ca. 4 mm, superior free portion ovate
to rhombic-ovate, apex rounded or obtuse, margins entire; stamens ca.
2.8 cm long, three free in the outer verticil, and
three of the inner verticil epipetalous, adnate ca. 0.4 cm,
anthers ca. 0.5 cm long, linear; gynoecium 3-3.4 cm long,
ovary cylindrical, axile placentation. Fruit a capsule, 3.5-4.5 × 1.4
cm; seeds ca. 1.7 cm long, funicle long, ca. 1
cm.
