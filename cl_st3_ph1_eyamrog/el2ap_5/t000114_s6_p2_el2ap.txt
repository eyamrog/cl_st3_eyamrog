The composition of bryoflora in our work proved to be
more related to that occurring in the Cerrado and in
the Amazon Forest. Between the two biomes, the Cerrado is
the closest to the Atlantic Forest, however, the Amazon Forest
is the second richest biome in the country (Costa &
Peralta 2015, Flora do Brasil 2020 2021), it also has
great affinity with the flora observed in the Atlantic Forest,
since they have an evolutionary historical relationship. Many listed taxa,
with the exception of the exclusive ones, has distribution both
in the Cerrado and in the Amazon Forest. Corroborating with
other studies carried out in the state, such as Sousa
& Faria (2016) and Faria et al. (2020).
