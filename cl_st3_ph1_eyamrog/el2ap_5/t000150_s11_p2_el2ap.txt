In the context of transnational machinery (see Baubock and Faist
2010), the issues revolve around the way and the consequences
of the lives of migrants taking place in two or
more countries simultaneously with the political and sociological implications of
a double engagement. A wide field and uneven of concerns,
it is true, but in all the incarnations of transnationalism
we see a centrality of the family as the privileged
and preferred driver link to this dual affiliation. But just
like the theories of networks, the family itself is just
a gear in the machinery of linking between two realities,
between national policy and the rights of migrants, a link
in the narrative for the establishment of national powers, discrimination,
and in the very constitution of "world-system".
