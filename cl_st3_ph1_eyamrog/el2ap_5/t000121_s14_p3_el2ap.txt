A sociodemographic questionnaire was used with the variables: sex (male
or female), age (in years), skin color (white, black or
brown; yellow and indigenous were excluded of the final sample
due to small occurrence in the sample), education (up to
high school or higher education), living alone (no or yes),
chronic disease (no or yes), income (with or without steady
income), health perception (ill or healthy), municipality and State of
living (place of residence).
