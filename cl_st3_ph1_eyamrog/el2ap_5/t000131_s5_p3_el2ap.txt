Differences in the level of total chlorophyll, carotenoids, and carotenoids/chlorophyll
ratio are reported between the sun and shade-adapted leaves from
other species (Demmig-Adams 1998; Lichtenthaler & Babani 2004, Lichtenthaler et
al. 2007). The increased accumulation of chlorophyll in Mikania plants
grown in the shade reflects a compensation mechanism to increase
the capture of light (Almeida et al. 2005). Chlorophyll is
continuously synthesized and degraded (photo- oxidation) in the presence of
light, but under conditions of high light intensity, the chlorophyll
molecules are more likely to be photo-oxidized, and a balance
is established under lower levels of irradiation (Kramer & Kozlowski
1979). The decreases of chlorophyll content and Fv/Fm values are
indicators of oxidative stress, as we observed in plants developed
under I0. However, in M. laevigata grew under I25 and
I50, the lowest chlorophyll content compared to M. glomerata may
help in photoprotection due to the reduced light interception, resulting
in higher Fv/Fm in this species (Munn√©-Bosch & Alegra 2000).
