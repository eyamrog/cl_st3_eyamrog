One means of estimating the size of the research audience
that stretches across national boundaries, is to investigate the citations
from a particular country[24]. This method allows us to find
out what kind of research is being conducted in other
geographical areas, and has also been reflected in some university
classifications, for example the Leiden Ranking [32] indicators. Citations can
obviously be positive or negative, because certain statements and results
by other authors may be supported and/or criticized[33], and the
way in which the outcome of a country's publications is
generalized has also been criticized[34]. International publications are also often
the target of publicly- funded research projects, for example, those
in the European Union [35]. While this citation impact can
be estimated for international publications, it can have the same
effect on the country in which the research findings are
published. The number of publications in different languages has been
investigated in several studies of countries[36], so this study gives
an insight into how publications are cited in various languages.
