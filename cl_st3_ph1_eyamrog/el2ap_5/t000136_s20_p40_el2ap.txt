In this context, an important element is the temporality of
governance in the third sector. NPO, in general, develop their
actions to attain their institutional missions through projects (Diallo and
Thuillier, 2004). Thus, the project, understood as a temporary effort
to generate a specific delivery (Project Management Institute, 2017), refers
to the object of the contractual relationship between NPO and
the donor organization. Hence, it is a business venture executed
within a specific time limit, with a defined scope, quality
and cost, in exchange for donation, and is subject to
a contract (or related term) between the parties. Therefore, the
project is the object of the contract, which, in turn,
is the link of the agency relationship between the NPO
(agent) and the donor organization (principal). Specifically, in this research,
we delimitated the donations with donor restrictions, according to this
understanding.
