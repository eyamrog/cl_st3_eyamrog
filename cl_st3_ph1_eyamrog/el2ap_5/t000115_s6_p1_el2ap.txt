The prevalence of enteroparasites in students in a Guarani indigenous
village in southern Brazil was evaluated before and after mass
treatment of the villagers with anthelmintic medication. There was no
significant difference in the frequency of enteroparasites between the first
collection of feces and the second collection, performed after treatment
of the population with ABZ, except for the frequency of
E. histolytica/E. dispar cysts, which was higher after treatment.
