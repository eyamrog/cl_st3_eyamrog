As argued in section 1.3, the appositive in (52) is
an ordinary CP (what we have called here a DP-like
CP), directly selected by the matrix verb, juxtaposed to the
nominal anchor “uma só coisa”. This suggests that the Wh-sentence
in (47) might also be juxtaposed to the nominal “Um
fã teu”. Ordinary appositive relatives are supposed to work differently;
in fact, an appositive relative clause cannot be juxtaposed to
the anchor, for the anchor is the nominal being relativized,
which has been raised from within the relative clause (see
Kayne, 1994; Bianchi, 1999).
