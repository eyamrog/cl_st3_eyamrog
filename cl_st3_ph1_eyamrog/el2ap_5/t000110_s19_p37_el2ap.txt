This material resembles that of Stauroneis schinzii (Brun) Cleve (1894:
146), however, the latter has very broadly rounded valve apices
and greater cell dimensions (Patrick & Reimer 1966: L: 130-221
µm, W: 17-19 µm, S: 15-18 in 10 µm) than
Stauroneis sp.1. The latter material is further characterized by having
linear valves, obtusely rounded subrostrate apices, broad linear slightly irregular
axial area that suddenly turns ovoid at the terminal ends,
relatively small fascia that slightly expands toward the margin, broad
raphe that somewhat narrows near by the proximal and distal
ends, branched distal raphe ends that form semicircular hooks bending
to the same direction, and radiate striae at the valve
center that become parallel toward the ends. It is present
in 35% of the core samples, and reached 2.6% maximum
abundance. The taxon was identified from samples corresponding to the
end of the Mid-Holocene to the core top (~5.760 cal.
yr BP to present).
