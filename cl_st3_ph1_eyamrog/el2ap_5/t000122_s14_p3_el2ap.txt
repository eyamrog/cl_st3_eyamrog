Specimens of B. binderi (ca. 900 mg) were kept in
1000 mL Erlenmeyers flasks containing 700 mL of culture medium
in constant aeration. The water temperature was 25 ºC, photonic
flux density of 60 - 80 µmol photons m-2 s-1
and a photoperiod of 12:12 h (light:dark cycle) for maintaining
of macroalgae in laboratory for one week before of the
chemical procedures to test surface decontamination. The culture medium was
sterilized seawater enriched with von Stosch’s solution (8 mL L-1)
prepared as described by Edwards (1970) and modified with reduction
of 50 % in the vitamin concentrations (Yokoya 2000).
