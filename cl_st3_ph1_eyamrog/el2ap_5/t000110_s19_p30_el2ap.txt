This species belongs to the group “pupula” of Sellaphora and
differs from Sellaphora pupula (Kützing) Mereschkovsky (1902: 187) in its
linear elliptical valves, with broadly rounded poles (Mann et al.
2008). It was present in 35% of the core samples,
reaching 6% maximum abundance. The species was identified from samples
corresponding to the end of the Mid-Holocene to the core
top (~6.000 cal. yr BP to the present day). Current
study is the first communication of this species occurrence in
the Brazilian Amazon.
