This species was identified as Staurosirella cf. acutirostrata (Metzeltin &
Lange-Bertalot) Almeida & Wetzel (2015: 267) due to presenting less
tapered extremities and shorter valve length (L: 22-36 Âµm) than
the ones described in Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot (1998: 89, pl.
1, fig. 18-19, pl. 2) It was reported in 48%
of all core samples, thus reaching a 4.3% maximum abundance.
The species is identified from samples collected toward the end
of the Mid-Holocene, from ~5.760 cal. yr BP up the
core top.
