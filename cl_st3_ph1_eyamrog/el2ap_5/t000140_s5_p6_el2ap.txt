This will provide the professional writers with a return on
their writings in university classes that is comparable to the
rate that they earn from bookstores sales. A case can
be made for charging a higher fee to social sciences
and humanities majors, whose courses assign far more media pieces
and trade book chapters than science courses, as well as
for billing students by the readings assigned in the courses
they take. At this point, however, what is at issue
is a general tariff payable to Access Copyright among all
students, for which $1.40 a student appears warranted by our
syllabus analysis, while avoiding the risk of double-charging students for
access to academic works. In total, Canadaâ€™s roughly 1.2 million
full-time university students or their institutions will be asked, under
this scheme, to pay $1,769,888 annually to Access Copyright for
the readings assigned to them.13
