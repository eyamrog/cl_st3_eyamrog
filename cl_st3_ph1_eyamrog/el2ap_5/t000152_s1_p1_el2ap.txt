The pandemic state caused by the rapid proliferation of Sars-Cov-19
has, in the short to long term, direct and indirect
impacts on Education. Cessation in direct contact between peers is
a limitation experienced by teachers and students. It implies the
access, permanence and training of academics in public or private
higher education due to the commitment of the economy and
the labor market. The aim of this article is to
reflect the impacts of COVID-19 on the access and permanence
of the low-income Brazilian population in higher education. We chose
to use as a source the educational censuses of Brazil
that point to data from the higher education presential and
at a distance, journalistic materials and other documentary sources that
unveil the Brazilian geographical and social realities. Public policies developed
by the Brazilian State that provided access to and permanence
in higher education are identified. However, the public institution cannot
contemplate everyone. Distance Education offered by private higher education institutions
approaches the different social class. It is considered that the
reflexes of the pandemic happen, massively on the poor and
miserable classes since those who are in the public university
do not sometimes have access to technology and if they
are in private universities feel the impact of the inability
to honor with tuition salaries beyond the closure of various
jobs in different sectors.
