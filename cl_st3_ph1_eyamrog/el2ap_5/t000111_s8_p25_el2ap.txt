Macambira (1998), considering morphosyntactic aspects of quem, attests it can
be an indefinite interrogative (23), an ordinary relative pronoun (24),
and an indefinite relative (25). Hence, in each occurrence, quem
is considered to represent a distinct item with proper morphosyntactic
characteristics.
