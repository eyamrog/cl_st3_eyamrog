Finally, even if it is thorough, the analysis carried out
in this study does not reach the internal management processes,
the various measures to face the pandemic, and the co-
responsibility of other government spheres on the results. Therefore, the
current analysis should not be used as a measure of
governmental administrations' performance but as a guideline about the objectivity,
clarity, and transparency of the recovery plans presented by each
Brazilian federated unit analyzed.
