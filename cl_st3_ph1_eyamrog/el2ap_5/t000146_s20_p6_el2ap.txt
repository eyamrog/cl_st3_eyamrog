In the case of Cuba and Peru more than 90
percent of their impact is in their own language, with
no clear evidence of their production gaining exposure. On the
other hand, the United States has the greatest impact on
other languages, especially when it publishes in Spanish. Brazil, likewise,
achieves its highest impact in another language when it publishes
in Spanish. This is due to the representativeness of the
Spanish-speaking audience in the database. Spain has a considerable impact
on other languages when it publishes in English. It is
clear from Fig. 1-A that the publication language has an
influence on the language of the target audience.
