Surirella sp. resembles Surirella terryi D.B.Ward ex W.A.Terry (1907: 127)
in its heteropolar valves and the cuneate valve apices. However,
the latter species has a more pronounced central area along
the apical axis and greater valve dimensions (Ferreira & Bicudo
2017: L: 67-176 μm, W: 23- 35 μm). The species
is also characterized by its asymmetric linear valves with a
rounded headpole and a cuneate footpole, a narrow hyaline axial
area, lack of costae, non visible fibulae, and low keel
and alar canals parallel to each other. This taxon was
present in 5% of the core samples, reaching 1% maximum
abundance. It was identified from samples corresponding to the Late
Holocene (~973 cal. yr BP).
