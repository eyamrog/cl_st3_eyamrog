As identified in this study, of the 27 Brazilian federative
units, only 18 presented plans to resume economic activities based
on epidemiological and health indicators. This fact leads to questioning
the types of criteria used by the nine federative units,
which did not structure formal reopening strategies or did so,
but at the municipal level, or without the adoption of
objective indicators.
