By 2010, the adoption by most public HEIs of the
ENEM as their admission criterion had greatly increased the number
of admissible applicants to higher education (Ministry of Education of
Brazil 2018a). To ensure greater access and standardize the university
admission process, the Ministry of Education developed a platform called
the Unified Selection System (SISU) (Ministry of Education of Brazil
2020a). This applied a unified application criteria to all public
HEIs and expanded the guarantee of equal opportunity to the
national level. Through SISU, candidates can apply to a public
or a private HEI, simultaneously applying for funding through ProUni
and FIES for the latter. Between 2009 and 2017, SISU,
FIES and ProUni raised enrolments to public and private HEIs
by approximately two million.
