BACKGROUND: In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared
the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. In Brazil, the high rate
of dissemination made it necessary to adopt restrictive measures nationwide
with the discussion regarding the resumption of economic activities starting
in April. In mid-December the country had 6,970,034 cases diagnosed
and 182,799 deaths from COVID-19.
