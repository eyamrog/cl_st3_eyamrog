Accountability, in turn, also similar to the principle of OECD
(2004), involves an administrative body that reports to a higher

the General Assembly or Board of Trustees, of the Annual
Report presented by NPOâ€™s chief executive; and also accountability to
donors, by sending them the Annual Report.
