As expected, the information coming from Universities and students are
not always available, since some of them do not reply
the questionnaires. There is also the problem of low reliability
and accuracy in those data. This is a weak point
for this ranking, but it is not so crucial, because
its goal is not to make a general classification, and
the users can benefit from the information available and just
neglect the missing ones.
