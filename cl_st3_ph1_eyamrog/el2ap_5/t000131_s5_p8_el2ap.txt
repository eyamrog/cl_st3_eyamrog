Our data showed that plants developed under low light intensity
showed an increased content of chlorophyll, LA, and SLA. However,
A was small when compared to other treatments, presumably resulting
in less aboveground dry mass. In both Mikania species, plants
developed under shaded environments (I75) showed lower performance than plants
grown in other environments. Plants grown under I25 presented higher
photosynthesis values than plants grown under I0, and this response
may be associated with an increased amount of chlorophyll. Although
both species are morphologically similar, M. glomerata and M. laevigata
showed distinct responses to irradiance levels. M. glomerata had great
biomass production under I0, I25, and I50 with low variation
regarding photosynthetic rates. While in M. laevigata plants, the highest
photosynthesis rate was observed under I25 and I50, while biomass
production was higher under I25. In this species we also
observed a higher investment in root growth under higher solar
radiances levels (I0 e I25), resulting in a decreased aboveground
biomass when compared to M. glomerata. While M. glomerata showed
higher SI, SD, LA, and SLA, M. laevigata showed a
thicker leaf. In addition to a thicker leaf, caused especially
by an increased AdE, the lower chlorophyll content and higher
photosynthesis rate observed under I25 and I50 presumably contributed to
the reduced photoinibitory effects (Fv/Fm) in this species when compared
to M. glomerata, under the same solar radiances level.
