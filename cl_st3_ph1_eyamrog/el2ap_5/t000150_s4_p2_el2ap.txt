Distinctions between the two Brazilian kinships in Portugal and the
three kinships generated by the Okinawan experience in Brazil and
Japan would simply be contingent to other analytical intentions. They
would not appear as the differences they produce on a
daily basis. And here, I answer the question about my
point in this speech: a machinery centered on kinship allows
me to bring out these so intense and meaningful differences.
This way, I place an anthropological conception of kinship in
favor of highlighting the differences created by the various kinships
migrants.
