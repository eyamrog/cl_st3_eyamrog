The first problem that appears is how to make a
general classification of academic Institutions using the “U-Multirank”, which was
not created for that. Even if it is not its
main goal, the “U-Multiranking” prepares general classifications when asked. As
an example, when we asked for a general classification of
the Brazilian Universities in the 2020 version using only the
Indicators that have more than 90% of data reported, it
gives the list showed in Table 1.
