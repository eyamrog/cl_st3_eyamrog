Diatoms were observed in all treatment and control samples. Nevertheless,
they were not quantified because procedures to inhibit growth of
these microalgae in culture medium are well- known, using GeO2
(Germanium Dioxide) that does not cause negative effects on the
macroalgae (Lewin 1966, Markham & Hagmeier 1982, Shea & Chopin
2007, Miranda et al. 2012, Saminathan et al. 2014). Diatoms
in macroalgal culture medium may grow and proliferate faster than
the algae do, competing for nutrients and releasing substances capable
of inhibiting algal growth (Berland et al. 1972). In our
study, these negative effects probably did not occur because the
thalli biomass did not vary significantly among weeks in the
control (which has not been subjected to chemical procedures for
decontamination), and RGRs of control thalli differed only from the
immersion treatment for 5 minutes, likely due to the effect
of sodium hypochlorite (discussed below).
