Item II of article 1 also reads: “school education should
be linked to the world of labor and social practice”
(Brasil, 1996), a guideline that connects with the idea of
education in all dimensions of life, albeit with social aims
addressed to the world of labor. In article 32 of
the LDBEN, especially section III of basic education and items
I, III and IV, the aims of the citizen’s basic
formation are formulated. Item I states that one of the
aims of basic education is the “understanding of the natural
and social environments, of the political system, of technology, of
the arts and of the values on which society is
based” (Brasil, 1996), that is, the aim of learning in
basic education teaching must be geared towards understanding the world,
society and its technologies. Item III refers to the development
of the capacity for learning, “in view of the acquisition
of knowledge and abilities and the formation of attitudes and
values” (Brasil, 1996).
