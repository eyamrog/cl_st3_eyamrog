Dry weight of seedling: first, the fresh weight was obtained
from 10 previously measured normal seedlings, for four replicates, and
then maintained in papers bags in a dryer at a
temperature of 60 Â°C until reaching a constant weight (48
h). Subsequently, the seedlings were weighed on a precision balance
(to 0.001 g) and the results were expressed in milligrams
(mg) (Nakagawa 1999).
