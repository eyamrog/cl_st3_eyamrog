This research analyzed associations between meta-concerns and anxious and depressive
symptoms at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil.
2,042 individuals participated, aged 18-78 years. A sociodemographic questionnaire, the
4-item Patient Health Questionnaire and the Meta-Worry Questionnaire were answered
online. Four Logistic Regression models were used to estimate the
effect of independent variables on anxiety and depression symptoms. The
variables being younger, not having a steady income, feeling ill,
and exhibiting a high level of meta-worries increased the chances
of showing symptoms. It was concluded that providing care in
the face of psychological suffering is fundamental in combating COVID-19,
since factors of susceptibility to the development of mental disorders
were detected at the beginning of the pandemic in Brazil.
