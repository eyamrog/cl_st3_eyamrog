Bostrychia spp. have growth by apical cells present in the
branches and Polysiphonia-type life history. Tetrasporophyte life stages (diploid) release
tetraspores (haploid) which develop male and female gametophytes (haploid). Male
gametophytes produce and release spermatia (haploid) which fertilize the carpogonium
(haploid) present at the end of carpogonial branches produced by
the female gametophytes. After fertilizing, the formation of carposporophytes (diploid)
occurs, which produce and release carpospores (diploid) which develop tetrasporophytes
(West et al. 1993, West et al. 2001).
