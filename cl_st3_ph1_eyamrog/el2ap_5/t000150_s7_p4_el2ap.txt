The first symptom of stiff, rusty machinery is its tendency
to become a "thing." We could call this trend "objectification".
An outstanding example for migration studies is the machinery of
"ethnicity". Formerly used to think critically about the adamant persistence
of difference in contexts where gradual "acculturation" was expected, replacing
machinery that hindered the understanding of phenomena (the machinery of
acculturation), became itself a "thing". People have ethnicity, ethnicity are
objects as palpable as this table. When the machinery turns
into thing, it is very easy to confuse the process
with the machinery itself, producing new stiffening.
