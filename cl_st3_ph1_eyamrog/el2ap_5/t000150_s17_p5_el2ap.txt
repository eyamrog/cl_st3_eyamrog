The most common was the migration of married men, leaving
their families in Brazil, waiting for their return (although several
other configurations were possible). But they all aimed at coming
back and reestablish the relations in Valadares. This trip organized
around kinship processes in Valadares had consequences in the way
Brazilians lived their lives in Portugal. Some of the consequences
that we can highlight are: a tendency to escape the
maximum from any public exhibition, longer working hours seeking to
accumulate more money, predominant living among Valadares migrants and a
greater inclination to join Brazilian Protestant religious communities in Portugal.
