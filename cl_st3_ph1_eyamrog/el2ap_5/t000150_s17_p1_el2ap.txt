Brazilian people in Portugal still constitute the largest group of
migrants in the country. Despite the crisis, the return rates,
or remigration, are relatively small, indicating the entrenchment of the
Brazilian community in Portugal (Machado 2014). From two sets of
fieldwork, I will expose some internal differences to that Brazilian
community which indicate the operation of distinguished kinship modes, leading
to different ways of relating to the country.
