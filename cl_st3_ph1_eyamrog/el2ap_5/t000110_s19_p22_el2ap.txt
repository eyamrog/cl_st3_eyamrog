This species was described by Grunow (1880: 21) as Achnanthes
exigua and later on transferred to Achnanthidium exiguum by Czarnecki
(1994: 157). However, according to Taylor et al. (2014) the
type of A. exiguum have significant morphological differences as compared
with members of Achnanthidium, suggesting that the transfer based on
the structure of the raphe was not correct. Due to
the presence of morphological features, such as sigmoid raphe, where
the distal raphe ends curve to the different sides, uniseriate
striae, and shape of the valves the species was transferred
to Gogorevia by Kulikovskiy et al. (2020). The species is
present in 5% of all core samples, reaching 1.5% maximum
abundance. It occurred in the Late Holocene (~1.514 cal. yr
BP). The species was already reported for Brazilian Amazon, in
the Negro river, as Achnanthidium exiguum (Grunow) Czarnecki, however, the
present is to be considered the first report for the
country using its correct name.
