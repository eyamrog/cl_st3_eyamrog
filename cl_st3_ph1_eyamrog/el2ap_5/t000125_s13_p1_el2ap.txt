The first idea of a multi-dimensional ranking appeared in 2008
(VAN VUGHT; ZIEGELE, 2012). After that, the European Commission decided
to develop a multidimensional academic ranking system. After some preliminary
tests, the first complete set of results appeared in May
2014. This ranking was developed and implemented by the European
Commission, using a consortium organized by the Centre for Higher
Education (CHE), in Germany; the Center for Higher Education Policy
Studies (CHEPS) at the University of Twente (Netherlands), the Centre
for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) from Leiden University (Netherlands)
and The Foundation for Knowledge and Development (Fundaci√≥n CYD) (Spain).
This project is headed by Dr. Frans van Vught (CHEPS)
and Dr. Frank Ziegele (CHE). It is still a recent
ranking, but it is increasing in popularity. The 2020 version
included 1,788 Universities from 92 countries, which means about 5,000
faculty members and more than 11,400 programmes in 28 subject
areas. (https://www.umultirank.org/about/u-multirank/frequently-asked-questions/)
