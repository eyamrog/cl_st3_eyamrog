We found relevant R2 values, especially considering the set of
variables absent in the model. A R2 of 0.508 indicates
that the relationships established account for 51% of the variance
of Donations, which provides the model a reasonable adjustment, given
its economical character; through the gradation exhibited by Sanchez (2013),
R2 values lower than 0.2, between 0.2 and 0.5, and
higher than 0.5 showed a low, moderate and high explanatory
power, respectively. According to Wetzels et al. (2009), in the
reflective-reflective type of models, first order constructs reflect the second-order
constructs, which leads to the conclusion that R2 values of
the latent variables of the first order reflective constructs indicate
how much they reflect the latent variables of the second-order
constructs. R2 of the latent variable of the first order
reflective construct indicates how much this latent variable is affected
by the latent variable variance of the second-order construct. Using
Wetzels et al. (2009) terms, we highlight that in the
Governance construct, the sub-dimension that best reflects it is Management,
R2 = 0.528, while for the Fiscal Council sub-dimension we
achieved R2 = 0.181.
