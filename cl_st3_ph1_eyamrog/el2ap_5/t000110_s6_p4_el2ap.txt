In the Late Holocene, 20 species were reported reaching 45.2%
maximum abundance, of which five are new records or the
Brazilian territory (Aulacoseira crassipunctata, Gomphonema pseudosphaerophorum, Sellaphora emilia, S. sassiana
e Lacuneolimna novagallia). In this period, the diatom assemblage was
composed by benthic species suggesting a shallower water condition with
with low conductivity, oligotrophic and acidic waters (Moro & FÃ¼rstenberger
1993, Van Dam et al. 1994, Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot 2007,
Bahls et al. 2009, Tudesque et al. 2015).Similar result was
registered by Cardozo et al. (2014), in Lake Tota, Colombia
during the Late Holocene and was attributed to a drier
period with high temperatures and low precipitation.
