Based on the valve outline, Sellaphora renata Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot
is quite similar to Sellaphora lambda (Cleve) Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot
(1998: 206). However, S. renata lack of marginal spines present
in S. lambda (Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot 2007). The species was
found in 5% of the core samples and reached 1.5%
maximum abundance. It was identified in samples corresponding to the
early Late Holocene (~1.322 cal. yr BP).
