Even though the Southeast of the country is a well-known
and already studied area, there are no published studies related
to the bryoflora of the PNC. Only a few records
of occasional collections exist (Yano & Peralta 2008, Yano 2010,
2012). For the state of Espírito Santo, scientific works are
still scarce and among the most recent we can only
mention Costa & Silva (2003) and Yano (2005) in board
forests, Silva & Piassi (2010) in restinga, Silva (2011), Silva
& Bastos (2012) and Sousa & Faria (2016) and Faria
et al. (2020) in Ombrophilous Forest. The aim of our
study was to carry out a survey of mosses that
occur along the PNC visitation trails beginning at the entrance
of the Espírito Santo portion in order to increase the
knowledge of the bryophyte flora in the state, of the
Atlantic Forest and to contribute to the conservation of ecologically
important species, especially threatened ones.
