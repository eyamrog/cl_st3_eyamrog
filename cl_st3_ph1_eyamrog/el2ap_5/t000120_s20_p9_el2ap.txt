The second genus in terms of highest richness and absolute
frequency was Acaulospora, located in areas where the pH ranged
between 4.4 and 5.0, as found by Da Silva et
al. (2006). However, neither genera are restricted to the edaphic
conditions of the experimental unit and the Brazilian climate. They
are widely distributed, being found across seven continents: North America,
South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, Antarctica and Oceania, and within
the four climate zones: tropical, subtropical, temperate, and boreal/austral (St√ºrmer
et al. 2018). Glomus and Acaulospora are the world's highest
species-rich genera, with 54 and 52 species respectively, described in
the Glomeromycota clade (Da Silva et al. 2014; Goto &
Jobim 2019).
