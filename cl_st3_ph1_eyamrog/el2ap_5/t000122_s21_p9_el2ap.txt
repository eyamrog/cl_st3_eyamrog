We observed during the cultivation that the immersion treatment in
sodium hypochlorite for 5 minutes caused a slight loss of
pigmentation in the thalli (thallus part bleaching). Probably for this
reason, the lowest growth was observed in this treatment, since
pigment loss results in photosynthetic impairment. Fernandes et al. (2011)
recorded also this effect in thalli treated with detergent and
sodium hypochlorite. However, as there was thalli recovery and immersion
for 2 minutes in sodium hypochlorite was sufficient for eliminating
contaminants without great negative effects on the macroalga, we recommend
the use of this chemical compound for 2 minutes, corroborating
with Holdt et al. (2014).
