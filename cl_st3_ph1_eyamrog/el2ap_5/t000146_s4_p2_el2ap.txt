Since the SciELO Network has now been operating for more
than 20 years,, the analysis of the impact of its
scientific output on the Public and Collective Health areas has
made it possible to find out which countries in the
region are most productive. This can be determined by the
citation flow which takes into account: a) the language of
the cited articles ; and b) the representativeness of SciELO
CI, with regard to the databases in the WoS platform.
This approach underlines the importance of a database such as
SciELO CI, in a research area concerned with local problems,
which are best investigated by nationally- affiliated researchers, and are
evident in regional or local communities, and where native languages
play an important role.
