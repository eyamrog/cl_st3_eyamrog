Popkewitz observes that in contemporary discourse, the expectations placed on
online learning are shared by authors with diverse political alignments.
He mentions Maeroff (2003), author of A classroom of one:
how online learning is changing our schools and colleges, for
whom online learning represents a learning possibility that crosses frontiers,
favoring the overcoming of provincialism, besides carrying out the dream
of personalized teaching. Then Hargreaves (2003) is quoted as a
representative of another political view, according to which the learning
society allows us to expect that the child will constitute
a cosmopolitan identity and will demonstrate tolerance in the face
of differences of race and gender; disposition to know other
cultures and responsibility for the integration of the excluded.
