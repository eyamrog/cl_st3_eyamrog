This is the first study that analyzed the factors associated
with spatial clusters of femicide in a geographic space where
there is a predominance of patriarchal culture. Although public policies
to combat femicide have already completed more than a decade
in Brazil, this study shows a very uneven distribution of
rates of femicide that showed a direct association with human
development and matriarchy, and an inverse association with concentration of
income. These findings reinforce the fact that of violence against
women as a multifactorial phenomenon, resulting from the interaction of
individual, relational, social, cultural, and environmental factors. Making it imperative
to carry out further studies to unravel the possible factors
that predispose as high rates of femicides in in the
municipalities of the State of Sergipe. It is suggested the
need for local redirection of Brazilian public policies to combat
femicide, since feminicide has its roots in gender inequality, having
different contexts that obey social dynamics and peculiarities to the
geographical context of its origin.
