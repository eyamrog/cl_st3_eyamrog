However, the absence of a minimum national guideline for the
economic reopening offered scope for the appearance of numerous discrepancies
between the different recovery plans presented by each federative unit
concerning the quantity and quality of the indicators used, the
metrics adopted, and the transparency and reliability of the selected
sources. The scenario above, associated with the scarcity of scientific
literature on the analysis of policies for easing restrictions, motivated
the search process and subsequent analysis of the totality of
economic recovery plans, allowing the discussion about the level of
objectivity and parameterization that subsidized the decisions of government agencies
for the relaxation of social isolation measures in each state.
