Fernandes et al. (2011) verified the potential of chemical agents
for surface decontamination of macroalgae (using Hypnea musciformis (Wulfen) J.V.Lamouroux
as a model) and found that detergent (5%) and sodium
hypochlorite (1.01%) were effective solutions. In our study, we tested
sodium hypochlorite in a lower concentration (0.2%) because Bostrychia sp.
have thallus more delicate than Hypnea J.V.Lamouroux. Gigartinales and Gracilariales
(e.g. Hypnea sp., Kappaphycus Doty, Chondrus Stackhouse, Gracilaria Greville) have
phycocolloids in the thallus, which provide more rigidity and consistency
to the thallus. Procedures for surface decontamination of these macroalgae
(e.g. Holdt et al. 2014, Yong et al. 2014, Saminathan
et al. 2014, Ali et al. 2018) are well-known due
to their economic importance.
