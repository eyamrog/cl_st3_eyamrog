It is therefore necessary to search for an explanation for
these facts, and it seems that this explanation lies in
the characterization of both types of sentence, as well as
in the description of their syntactic-semantical behavior. In order to
implement the analysis, I shall first discuss briefly the characteristics
of apposition; then, I shall focus on the examination of
appositive sentences, especially the Brazilian Portuguese data found in (1)
and (2). The paper is organized as follows: in section
1, I discuss apposition in general and sentential apposition, as
well discussing the typology of sentential apposition in Brazilian Portuguese.
In section 2, I focus on Brazilian Portuguese QUEM sentences,
with a special look at free relative sentences. Section 3
contains the analysis I implement in this paper and section
4 holds the final remarks.
