In short, we assume that governance practices allow NPO to
have easier access to the donations market, or more specifically,
governance positively affects NPO donations (Harris et al., 2015). Understanding
that governance relieves the agency problem that results from the
contractual relationship between donor (principal) and NPO (agent) in the
donation process (Jensen and Meckling, 1976) supports this assumption.
