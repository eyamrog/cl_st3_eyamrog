An additional 14 species were indistinctly distributed throughout the core,
reaching 75.3% maximum abundance. The results showed that this variation
in diatoms species can indicate water level changes in the
Xingu river, so that at the end of the Mid-Holocene
the system presented deep waters that gave way to shallower
waters in the Late Holocene.
