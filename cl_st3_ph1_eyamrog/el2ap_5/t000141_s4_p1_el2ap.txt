Given the data mentioned above and taking into account the
objective of the study, it is possible to conclude that
the normative basis of the Brazilian states showed variation in
terms of configuration and characteristics as a result of the
absence of an effective national policy in coordinating actions between
the different Brazilian states. Because of the adoption of divergent
policies between the different government levels, the plans formulated by
the states, which disaggregated the process of relaxing restrictions, prevailed.
