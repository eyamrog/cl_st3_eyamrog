The reptilian species richness recorded in the PNT was also
relatively high in comparison with the data from other Atlantic
Forest remnants in the state of Rio de Janeiro, as
recorded in both short-term (Morro São João, Casimiro de Abreu,
N = 9 species; Almeida-Gomes et al. 2008) and medium-term
studies (Reserva Ecológica de Guapiaçu, N = 37 species; Almeida-Gomes
et al. 2014a), and even the short-term study of Vrcibradic
et al. (2011) at the Estação Ecológica Estadual do Paraíso,
which reached a total of 29 species with the inclusion
of secondary data.
