Instabilities in the labour market directly affect studentsâ€™ interest in
attending higher education. In a survey commissioned by the Brazilian
Association of Higher Education Administrators (Brazilian Association of Higher Education
Administrators 2020a) of 1,607 students at private HEIs from all
regions of Brazil, 52% of participants stated that they hoped
to continue their studies after the pandemic, 42% expressed uncertainty
about whether they would continue their studies, 4% intended to
drop out, and 2% confirmed that they would definitely drop
out because of the pandemic. Between the months of April
and May 2020, the rate of default in payment of
higher education fees rose by 75%, reflecting the crisis experienced
by those who bear total or partial cost of their
studies alongside familial responsibilities (Brazilian Association of Higher Education Administrators
2020a).
