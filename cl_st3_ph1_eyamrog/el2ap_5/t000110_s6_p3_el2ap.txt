Considering the studied period, only three species exclusively occurred during
the end of the Mid-Holocene reaching 4.5% maximum abundance. This
low abundance of diatoms species during the end of the
Mid-Holocene may be related to the deeper waters with hydrological
flow. This finding is consistent with the results in studies
in the Amazon Basin (e.g., Cordeiro et al., 2008, Moreira
et al. 2013, Brugger et al. 2016, Fontes et al.
2017).
