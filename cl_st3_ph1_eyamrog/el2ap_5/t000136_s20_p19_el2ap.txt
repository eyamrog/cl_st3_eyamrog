Thus, the audit report is a measure of NPOâ€™s reputation
(Watts and Zimmerman, 1978), in addition to providing an external
overview, thereby reducing agency costs (Harris et al., 2015; Watts
and Zimmerman, 1978). This makes donors more confident about the
reliability of NPO's financial-accounting information, and safe about the protection
of the donated resources.
