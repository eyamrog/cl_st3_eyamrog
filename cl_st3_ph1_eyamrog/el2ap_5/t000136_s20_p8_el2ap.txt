Hence, from this theoretical domain, we assumed that governance is
an abstraction of a higher order that operates through a
set of dimensions. Harris et al. (2015), among others, characterized
the theoretical attributes that are potential determinants of governance as
latent variables, assuming the reflective character for the constructs. Thus,
in the context of this research, we considered the observable
variables (proxies) as indicators that reflect the underlying theoretical constructs.
