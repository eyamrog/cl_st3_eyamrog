This hypothesis derives from the understanding that governance mitigates agency
problem, due to the contractual relationship between principal (donor) and
agent (NPO), through mechanisms that minimize several effects. Some of
them are information asymmetry, distinct utility functions (motivation and goals),
different levels of risk aversion, rational behavior of the agent,
different planning horizon, and lack of a perfect contract (see
Lacruz, 2020). Hence, governance assures donors that their interests will
prevail in the application of the resources given to the
NPO.
