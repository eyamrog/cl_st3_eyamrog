The non-academic readings were less prevalent. The 873 media pieces,
for example, appeared on 194 syllabuses (5.7% of all syllabuses)
in clusters of 4.5 items on average, while 918 trade
book chapters were found distributed across 148 (4.4%) the syllabuses
in clusters of 6.2 chapters per syllabus with a trade
book chapter. There is considerable mixing of reading types as
can be seen by comparing the number of syllabuses with
readings (923) to the number of syllabuses for each type,
which suggest more than one reading type on the majority
of the syllabuses with readings.
