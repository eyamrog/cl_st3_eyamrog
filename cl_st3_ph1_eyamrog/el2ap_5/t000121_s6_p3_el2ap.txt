Another important variable was the perception of health. Results showed
that those who perceived themselves as ill showed a higher
probability of having symptoms of anxiety and / or depression.
In other words, participants who already had some level of
previous health issue or vulnerability seem, on average, to have
twice the chance of developing some symptoms of anxiety or
depression. Due to the daily stress related to the day-to-day
life of the pandemic - to which they had already
been exposed for 2 months - at the beginning of
the confinement those individuals who declared their perception of health
as deteriorated may have already had some differentiated vulnerability. Poor
health perception was associated with higher rates of depression and
anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic also in other studies (Wang
et al., 2020), especially if the perception of illness is
related to the suspected contagion by the coronavirus (Nguyen et
al., 2020), which reinforces the consonance of this finding with
previous evidence.
