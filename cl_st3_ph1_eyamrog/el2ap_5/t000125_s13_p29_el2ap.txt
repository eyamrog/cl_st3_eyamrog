In the year 2017, showed in Table 2, there is
a clear advantage of São Paulo State University (UNESP), with
an average of 2.81 points, against 1.56 of Federal University
of Mato Grosso, the second place. After that all the
Universities are below the mark of 1.0 point and they
are very close to each other. Note that only 0.32
points separates the third from the last place. Unesp leads
in all Dimensions, but two Dimensions deserves to be mentioned:
“Teaching and Learning”, with 3.25 points in a Dimension where
only Unesp and Federal University of Mato Grosso (2.00 points)
have reported data; and “Regional Engagement”, where Unesp reached a
very high score of 4.00, against 1.17 of the second
place, also the Federal University of Mato Grosso. The reasons
for those results needs to be better studied, but it
is important to remember that Unesp increased very much the
number of campus in the last decades by absorbing smaller
private academic Institutions in many cities in São Paulo state.
