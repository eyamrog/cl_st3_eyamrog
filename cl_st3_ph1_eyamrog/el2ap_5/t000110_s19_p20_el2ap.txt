Gomphonema pseudosphaerophorum H. Kobayasi has slightly narrower valves than Gomphonema
sphaerophorum Ehrenberg (1845: 78, Tyree & Vaccarino 2016: W: 8.1-9.4
µm and W: 12.8-13.2 µm, respectively). Additionally, G. pseudosphaerophorum has
dimly punctate striae radiating throughout the valve, whereas G. sphaerophorum
has nearly parallel striae at the mid- valve, becoming radiate
toward the apices. Occurrence of representative specimens of this species
was rare and only found in 2% of the core
samples, reaching 1% maximum abundance. It is present in samples
corresponding to the Late Holocene (~456 cal. yr BP). Current
study is the first citation of the occurrence of this
species in Brazil.
