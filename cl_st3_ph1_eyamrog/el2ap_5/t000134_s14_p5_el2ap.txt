Species endemism in the Atlantic Forest was defined for the
amphibians based on Lingnau et al. (2008), Haddad et al.
(2016), and Frost (2020), and for reptiles according to Tozetti
et al. (2017). We defined the conservation status of each
species based on the IUCN Red List (IUCN 2020), the
Red List of Threatened Brazilian Fauna (ICMBIO 2018), and the
List of the Threatened Fauna of Rio de Janeiro state
(Bergallo et al. 2000). The population trend for each species
was obtained from IUCN (2020).
