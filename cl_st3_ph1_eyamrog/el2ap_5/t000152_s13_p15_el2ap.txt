Brazil already had about 12.9 million unemployed people before the
COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2020 the unemployment rate was 10.5%
with a peak of 14.3% in August and slight slowdown
to 13.7% in September (Brazilian Institute of Statistics and Geography
2020). The crisis has affected the work of at least
one member of 57.2% of families, the need for social
isolation caused impediments to work for 45.5% of families, and
14.3% lost their work entirely (Get√∫lio Vargas Foundation 2020).
