TDS explains the subconscious need to defend social hierarchies based
on a series of ideals and belief systems. When a
hegemonic, or oppressor group holds a disproportionate amount of benefits
(e g., social status, power, money, highly esteemed roles), a
subordinate - or oppressed group - is in a disproportionate
situation (Acosta 2019). Therefore, the theory focuses on the social-psychological
processes by which ideological structures are internalized in individual attitudes
and beliefs (Islam, 2014). In contemporary society, white people have
privileges (e g., job opportunities, better food and health, longer
life) and facilities to transmit things that make life easier
for their children (e g., wealth, education, social connections). In
the current context, black people and other minorities are four
times more likely to die from Covid-19 (Dyer, 2020). However,
the image of minorities and oppressed people in this society
contrasts sharply with the “cultural virtues” and the representation of
the former group (the latter seen as uncontrolled, dangerous, lazy,
and dishonest) (Pratto et al., 2000).
