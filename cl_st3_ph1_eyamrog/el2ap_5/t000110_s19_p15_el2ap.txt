Present species resembles Placoneis constans (Husted) Cox var. symmetrica (Hustedt)
Kobayasi in its valves and rostrate ends. However, P. exigua
differs by having larger valves than P. constans and presents
a central area with a shorter striae surrounded by longer
striae (Bartozek et al. 2018). The species was reported for
6% of the core samples, thus reaching 1.5% maximum abundance.
This taxon is met in samples from the end of
the Mid-Holocene to the core top (~5.479 cal. yr BP
to the present day).
