In general, the most typically used mobile phones are not
equipped in terms of hardware and software to work with
digital platforms or to support the large-volume downloads required for
studies. In this sense, it would be necessary for classes
to be taught using social media applications such as Instagram,
Facebook, WhatsApp, which would ensure greater usability, but also impose
much greater restrictions in terms of the resources that can
be used. This means that internet access through a mobile
phone may not be sufficient to support participation in online
modes of education.
