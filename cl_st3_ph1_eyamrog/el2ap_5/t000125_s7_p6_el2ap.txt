The larger number of Indicators used by the “U-Multirank” gives
a more complete view of the Universities, but generates the
problem of lack of data. This is particular true for
non-Europeans Universities, in particular for Latin American countries. A large
portion of data comes from questionnaires collected from the Universities,
and many of them do not report regularly those information.
This point will also be analyzed here regarding the Brazilian
Universities listed in this ranking.
