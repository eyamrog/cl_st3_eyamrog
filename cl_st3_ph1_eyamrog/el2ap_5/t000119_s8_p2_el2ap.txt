The study of water relations is important to comprehend the
seed germination process in water stress conditions. It is estimated
that 20% of all irrigated land is currently affected by
salt stress (Taiz et al. 2017). Inadequate agricultural production techniques,
such as the intensive use of fertilizers that have high
concentrations of salts in their composition and the improper development
of crop irrigation methods are the main causes of soil
salinization (Cruz et al. 2017). Salinity decreases crop yield by
reducing soil water availability and by the toxicity of chemical
elements, especially sodium and chlorine (Souza et al. 2014), as
well as causing protein denaturation and membrane destabilization, which reduce
above-ground plant growth and inhibit photosynthesis (Taiz et al. 2017).
