A total of 2042 Brazilians, of both sexes, aged between
18 and 78 years, participated in the study at late
March 2020. The sample comprised mainly individuals located in the
Northeast region (80%, n = 1634), with 14.1% (n =
288) in the Southeast, and 5.9% (n = 120) in
other regions of the country. Specifically, in relation to the
Northeast region, 74.6% of the individuals (n = 1219) lived
in Sergipe. The sampling used was non-probabilistic, by convenience, and
via online collection. The only inclusion criterion set was age
over 18 years.
