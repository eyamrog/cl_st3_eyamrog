The data thus show that the predominance of English-language papers
is limited to WoS. Within WoS, Portuguese is the second
most important publication language, while Spanish plays a smaller but
still significant role.. Hence, it is worth noting that the
distribution of publication languages is completely different within SciELO CI,
in a situation where Spanish dominates, and represents approximately 40%
of the papers, while the presence of Portuguese is more
prominent than that of English. In general terms, science is
a global undertaking, and scientific knowledge is of global significance;
that is, in theory it should have a worldwide audience
[18]. This feature has been classified as the ´ Fourth
Age of Research´, which has moved on from individual, institutional
and national levels to international collaboration [19-20]. International collaboration can
assist in overcoming global challenges and provide access to a
suitable infrastructure and appropriate funding schemes[20]. In addition, international collaboration
can have a greater research impact, [20] for example in
terms of citations[21]. Researcher mobility based on bibliographic data, has
also been investigated in several studies [22-23], and international collaboration
networks have been studied in depth[24-25]. These networks are also
strongly supported by research funding[26]. Finally, research from one region
or country can be of great importance for other geographical
regions, especially in areas such as Public and Collective Health.
As mentioned above, since English is the lingua franca of
science, it can reach out to an audience beyond national
borders. This is essential for communicating with researchers and society
abroad, although research must also be conducted in national languages
so that it can influence and reach out to the
local community.
