More research is needed about the impact of COVID-19 on
Brazilian education in terms of processes, perspectives and scenarios at
all levels of teaching. The right to higher education, whether
in classroom or online mode, needs to become a greater
part of popular political consciousness, thereby exerting pressure on political
leaders. This also entails a reconception of the role and
form of government, as education has the potential to transform
the lives of poor and excluded people. Most importantly, public
policies need to consider the need for more spaces in
public HEIs and more opportunity for student finance in private
HEIs.
