Primary Health Care (PHC) is the World Health OrganizationÂ´ strategy
to achieve increased access and quality of care for populations1.
It has been used for strengthening health systems in many
countries, as the most appropriate response to the epidemiological and
demographic transition experienced in these places2,3. Brazil has published the
first version of the National Primary Care Policy (PNAB) in
20064. This historic milestone expands primary care, from the level
of a health program to a strategy, named the Family
Health Strategy (FHS)5. Its main features are team and territory-based
continuous care, with strong family and community orientation and the
formal engagement of community members in the teams (Health Community
Agents)6.
