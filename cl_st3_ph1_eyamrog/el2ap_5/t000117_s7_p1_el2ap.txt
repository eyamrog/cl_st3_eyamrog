Among the diverse pieces of news circulating on social media,
we recently found a publication in platform Terra’s education portal5
titled With the pandemic, digital literacy becomes a step towards
the pedagogy of the future – basic education up to
university teachers need to be prepared during their training to
use the Internet's interactivity, audiovisual resources and hybrid models with
classes mediated by technology. Written by journalists Ocimara Balmant and
Alex Gomes, the article recommends teachers to learn how to
deal with a new generation of students who are immersed
in the context of and interaction with Information and Communication
Technologies (ICTs). According to the journalists, such technologies have become
a phenomenon in themselves, promoting in some teacher training courses
profound curricular changes in order to meet the new demands
of the contemporary social tissue. These are attractive textual enunciations
that, as they capture the reader by announcing a new
era for education featuring more interactivity, use of Internet and
of audiovisual resources, they also seek to inaugurate the new
in the educational arena (Farias, 2020).
