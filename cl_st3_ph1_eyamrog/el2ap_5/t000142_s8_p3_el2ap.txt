According to Ert√ºrk (2015)10, the female body is subjected to
social control for the social groups to reproduce generations according
to specific criteria. Violence against women has been normalized throughout
the historical process and has become an "ordinary tool" used
to maintain labor division between the genders. The data have
demonstrated that this tool has been used all over the
world. In particular, women are more vulnerable to the inevitable
violence and death in societies where women are of less
value and provided fewer rights than men. Inequalities in the
gender ratio and the relatively high number of males have
potentially devastating consequences for society11.
