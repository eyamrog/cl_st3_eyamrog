Lastly, the results of our study demonstrated that increased saline
concentration in the substrate promoted a significant decrease in seed
germination and initial growth of common rue seedlings. The calcium
chloride (CaCl2) promoted more drastic effects on seedling growth when
compared to sodium chloride (NaCl). According to Souza and Cardoso
(2000), the chemical differences between these solutions can cause changes
in germination and vigor results even at similar water potentials.
