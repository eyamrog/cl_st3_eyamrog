We now turn to Fig. 1-B, where the particular audience
is provided by SciELO CI. Brazil, again, is the only
case that allows the percentage of citations in SciELO CI
to be compared, when the three publication languages are taken
into account. The SciELO CI domain is important for its
audience, which represents about two thirds of the databases of
the WoS platform, when it publishes in Portuguese. Next comes
the Spanish language, where the impact on SciELO CI is
a little less than 60.8%. The effects of the English
language are less apparent in the SciELO CI domain (40.8%).
