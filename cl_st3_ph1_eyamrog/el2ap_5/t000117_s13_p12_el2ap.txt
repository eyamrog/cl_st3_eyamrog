In general terms, the guiding ideas of the report by
Faure and collaborators (1973) can be set around the concepts
of “educational cities” and “lifelong education”. The former regards societies
whose educational problems would be at the center of all
social institutions, so that learning and teaching would constitute the
modus operandi of city life. The latter concept would encompass,
in its turn, learning beyond the school cycles as it
recognizes that the individual is never fully formed, on the
contrary, he or she will always be in the process
of being formed in a continuous work in progress.
