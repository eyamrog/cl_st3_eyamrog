However, this advance in enrolments has stalled under the last
three presidents of Brazil – Dilma Roussef, Michel Temer and
Jair Bolsonaro – due to cuts in the budgets of
ProUni and FIES. Between 2010 and 2014, the number of
student loans approved rose from 70,000 to 739,000. This number
fell by 62% to 281,000 in 2015 and even further
to 170,095 by 2017. In 2018 the number of approved
loans rose again to 300,000, but only 24% of these
were granted under the new financing criteria, which were based
on family income and other sources of finance. Although more
loans were available, the new criteria made them difficult to
access. It is estimated that only 100,000 student loans will
be disbursed in 2020, and this is expected to drop
to just over 50,000 in 2021. This trend has directly
and negatively affected the most vulnerable sections of Brazilian society
who are unable to afford monthly tuition fees for private
HEIs (Saldaña 2019; Brasil247 2020). Young people voiced their concern
and expressed resistance to the cuts made by the Temer
government by taking to the streets in 2016 (Students National
Union 2016).
