The machinery should be constantly changing, because reality never responds
exactly to our models. This leads to several possibilities, and
a very common one is the machinery stiffening: in this
case, we force reality to fit the models and the
machinery is transformed from a tool to aid reflection into
something that hinders the understanding of the phenomena. Therefore, machinery
helps or hinders. And when it hinders, the result is
that what it was supposed to understand, ends up being
concealed by the machinery.
