The variable living alone, which can refers to the perception
of less social support, increased the chances only for depressive
symptoms only. On this, the literature shows that individuals who
live alone are less likely to share worries and fears
throughout the pandemic, except through devices (Jacob, Haro, & Koyanagi,
2019; Stahl, Beach, Musa, & Schulz, 2017). Then, it seems
plausible to think that, if affected by COVID-19, these individuals
seem to have less perception that they would eventually obtain
support to deal with the disease.
