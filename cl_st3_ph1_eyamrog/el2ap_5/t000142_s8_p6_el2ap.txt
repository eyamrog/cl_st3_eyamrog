Recession, unemployment, and poverty caused by the crises adversely affect
human psychology. In a report published by the World Health
Organization (WHO)19 during the days of the COVID-19 pandemic when
the risk of violence against women increased, it is observed
that the reasons for the increase of violence against women
include unemployment, economic problems, prolonged staying at home and stress.
The main reason for the increasing domestic violence is the
predominant patriarchal order and gender inequality. The long-term presence of
the potential aggressor and victim in a certain socio-geographic location
prepares the ground for violence, conforming with the many theories
of criminology20. Unemployment has been proven to be associated with
family breakdowns, alcohol addiction, crime, and violence, based on a
relationship found between the increase in the unemployment rate by
1% and the death of 37 thousand individuals, 920 cases
of suicide, 650 cases of murders, 4 thousand hospitalizations in
the mental hospital and the imprisonment of 3.3 thousand individual,
over a six-year period21. Empirical studies have demonstrated that the
increase in unemployment22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30 and income inequality31,32 increases crime rates. Nikolaos
& Alexandros (2009)33 found a negative relationship between wage and
crime rate in the short term. According to Lombardo &
Falcone (2011)34, the highest crime rates are observed in regions
with high divorce rates, youth unemployment, and female employment. Andresen
(2012)35 determined that the income had a significant and positive
coefficient in the crimes of violence and mentioned that the
unemployment rate had a significant and positive coefficient in the
crimes of violence in the long run. Taş et al.
(2014)36 determined a similar relationship between the rates of unemployment
and divorce. Kavaklı (2020)37 found that femicide was committed mostly
in economically less developed locations. Economic development reduces the negative
impact of the risk factor.
