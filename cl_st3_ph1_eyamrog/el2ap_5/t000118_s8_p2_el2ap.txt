Serra da Bocaina is part of the Serra do Mar
mountain range and is located along the boundaries of the
States of SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, in Southeastern
Brazil. Serra da Bocaina is formed by large extensions of
well-preserved Atlantic Rainforest, including several physiognomical formations like lowland forests,
nebular forests and altitude fields. The diversity of physical attributes,
such as the great topographical variation (rising from sea level
to 2,088 m) with marked steep slopes and mountainous highlands,
and the high pluvial rates (annual average of ca. 1,700
mm), have likely formed distinct niches and refuges, rendering high
levels of biological diversity and endemism (IBAMA 2002, Freitas 2010).
