Two of the three most abundant snakes recorded during our
surveys were members of the family Viperidae (B. jararaca and
B. jararacussu), whose representatives are common in areas of mainland
Atlantic Forest (Marques & Sazima 2004, Pontes et al. 2009).
The Dipsadidae Thamnodynastes cf. nattereri was the second most abundant
snake in the PNT, and was also one of the
most abundant in the PNM Serra do Mendanha (Pontes et
al. 2009).
