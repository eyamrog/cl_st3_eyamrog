(Survey of mosses (Bryophyta) along visitor trails in the Parque
Nacional do Caparaó, Espírito Santo State, Brazil). Bryophyta, the mosses,
are an abundant plant group in humid environments. In the
Atlantic Coastal Forest of Southeastern Brazil, they are found in
great richness and diversity, especially in the montane regions. In
this context, the Parque Nacional do Caparaó, where our study
was conducted, is known for its mountain environment and high
altitude. Although a considerable number of moss collections from the
western part of the park is already deposited in herbaria,
the eastern side belonging to the state of Espírito Santo
State had been undersampled until now. For this pioneering work,
we covered the park's main visitation trails during three intensive
days of collections. We found 59 species of mosses, belonging
to 38 genera and 22 families. Nine species are new
occurrences for the state and 14 are Brazilian endemics. Most
species were found growing on soil. We found more species
at altitudes above 1,500 m a.s.l. Sematophyllaceae was the richest
moss family.
