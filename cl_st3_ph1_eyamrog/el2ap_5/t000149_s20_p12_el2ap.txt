On the other hand, there were families exclusive to each
site (Tab. 3), with the exception of PB. In the
RZ there were 14 families, four of which are representatives
of the aquatic habitat (Arecaceae with 3 sp, and Ceratophyllaceae,
Hydrocharitaceae, Salviniaceae with 1 sp. each), and the rest are
families that are common in humid and somewhat shady habitats,
such as the Asparagaceae (1 sp.), Campanulaceae (1 sp.), Cyperaceae
(2 sp.), Oxalidaceae (1 sp.), Typhaceae (1 sp.) and Vitacaea
(1 sp.); and the Portulacaceae (2 sp.) and Tamaricacae (1
sp.) in open, sandy places. The Salicaceae (3 sp.) and
Ulmaceae (1 sp.), of arboreal habit, form dense groves on
the banks of the river that are often impenetrable; in
the autumn they form beds of leaves that the cattle
consume. In the PP the exclusive families were the Shoepfiaceae
with 1 sp. (Arjona tuberosa Cav.) Orobanchaceae (Agalinis communis (Cham.
& Schltdl.) Dâ€™Arcy) and Hydrophyllaceae (Phacelia Juss. 3 sp.). No
exclusive families were found in the FE and only one
(Apocynaceae, Tweedia brunonis Hook. & Arn.) in the VP.
