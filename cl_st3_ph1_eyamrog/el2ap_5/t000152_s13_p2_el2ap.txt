This approach became deeply engrained in Brazil, resulting in the
denial of access to higher education, and thereby of social
mobility, to the majority of Brazilians over many generations. Despite
the absence of census data on higher education until 1950
there are numerous indicators that access was limited to the
upper socio- economic classes. Considering the census ot the Brazilian
Institute of Geography and Statistics, in 1950 the number of
enrolments in higher education was 210,270. This figure rose modestly
to 593,009 in 1970 (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics,
1950; 1970), continued to grow to 1,377,286 in 1980, and
reached the marker of 2,125,958 students in 1998 (National Institute
of Studies and Educational Research An√≠sio Teixeira 2000a). Despite this
increase, in 1997 only 12% of the population aged 19-24
years attended university (Saviani 2010). This disparity prompted the emergence
of several social and intellectual movements in the first half
of the twentieth century, demanding more egalitarian access to quality
education.
