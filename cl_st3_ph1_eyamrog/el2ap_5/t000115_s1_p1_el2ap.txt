The high frequency of intestinal parasites is favored by environmental
and socio-cultural conditions of indigenous populations, and is still a
neglected public health problem. Mass administration of broad-spectrum drugs aims
to reduce the prevalence and intensity of the infections. The
prevalence of intestinal parasites in school-children in an indigenous Guarani
village was evaluated before and after the mass treatment of
the population with albendazole. In the first phase of collection
of stool samples, 81.4% of them were positive for enteroparasites
and in the second phase, after two doses of antiparasitic
medication, 87.5% were positive. Although the prevalence of infections by
some helminths has reduced after treatment, many parasites remained frequent
in the studied population, showing a change in the epidemiological
profile in the distribution of these diseases in the population.
The prevalence of intestinal parasites in indigenous schoolchildren proved to
be high even after mass treatment with albendazole.
