The pond slider, Trachemys scripta, was originally found in the
southern United States and northern Mexico, but since the 1970s,
large numbers have been raised in the United States for
the pet trade, and this resulted in the introduction of
the species in many places around the world (e.g., Ramsay
et al. 2007, van Dijk et al. 2011). The presence
of T. scripta in natural environments has negative impacts on
the native freshwater turtles (e.g., Cadi & Joly 2004, Hidalgo-Vila
et al. 2009). Trachemys scripta has been recorded in disturbed
areas within the PNT, probably as the result of intentional
release of animals raised as pets. It is still unclear
whether this exotic species has established a viable population in
the state of Rio de Janeiro (Oliveira et al. 2020).
