been successful in transforming traditional perception, public awareness, scientific research,
and policymaking. This new word is used in the political
context to understand women's violent deaths and create changes in
the social order. It aims to prevent the confusion of
women's violent deaths with the concept of murder, which does
not discriminate between genders, draw attention that it is a

evolved as a theoretical concept aimed at reversing the structuring
forms of patriarchal power.
