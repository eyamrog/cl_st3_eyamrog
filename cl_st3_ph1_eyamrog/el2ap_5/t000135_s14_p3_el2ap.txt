The exposure variable was the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic
and seeks to estimate the impact of Sars-Cov-19 on the
Public Health System in Brazil. The figure for the rate
of procedures in the current pandemic (February to December 2020)
was monthly, compared (to avoid seasonal variations) to the rate
of procedures in the equivalent months in 2019 and 2018
(pre-pandemic). We are assuming that the first confirmed case of
Sars-Covid-19 in Brazil occurred in February 2020.
