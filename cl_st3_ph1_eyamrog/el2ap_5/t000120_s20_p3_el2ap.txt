Physico-chemical Analysis of Soil Integrated Samples - the soil particle
size analysis performed on the first integrated sample characterized the
soil as sandy clay with an increased ratio of clay
in deeper layers, which categorizes it as “argissolo” (in the
Brazilian Soil Classification System), according to Dos Santos et al.
(2018).
