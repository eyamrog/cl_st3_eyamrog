Considering all identified species (n = 27), 14 were found
in all groups in both sampling periods. The species Acaulospora
alpina and Glomus aggregatum did not appear in the first
period, which suggests a propensity for sporulation in the dry
season. Total species richness displayed a tendency to decrease by
six (species 2, 11, 14, 20, 26 and 27) between
sampling periods. This trend is probably explained by sporulation inactivity
in the dry season, but the number of sample plots
in this study was small, thus it is believed that
a larger number of plots could strengthen the reliability of
this assumption. Studies aiming to investigate AMF diversity in disturbed
soil with varying gravimetric moisture and organic matter percentages throughout
the year may provide guidance in understanding the species most
susceptible to these variables.
