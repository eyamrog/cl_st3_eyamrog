When a plant tissue, especially seed or root, is subjected
to higher saline concentrations, salt stress causes reduction in seedling
growth (Cavalcante et al. 2019), as observed in our study.
Cell growth is the most affected process with reduced water
absorption. The effect of salinity on the root system is
due to the conditions where the roots are in direct
contact with the salts of the medium, causing a reduction
in the transpiration and growth rate (Guimar√£es et al. 2013).
Salinity affects the germination process not only by hindering the
kinetics of water absorption but also by facilitating the entry
of large amounts of ions that may be toxic to
seeds, such as Na- and Cl-, and may promote physiological
disorders and culminate in plant death (Pereira et al. 2014).
