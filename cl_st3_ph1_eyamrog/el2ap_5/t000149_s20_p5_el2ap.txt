and the cattle, it is seen that 30% (93 sp)
of the total taxa identified is consumed. The most consumed,
according to the habit, were the herbaceous species (55 sp.;
59%), of which 31 sp. were grasses, whereas the shrub
or sub-shrub group reached 33% (31 sp.) and the rest
corresponded to the arboreal habit (Fig. 3a).
