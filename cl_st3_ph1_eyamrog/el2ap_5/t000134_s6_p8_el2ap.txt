The most abundant reptiles in the PNT were Enyalius brasiliensis
and Ecpleopus gaudichaudii, and accounted for approximately 60% of the
total reptilian abundance recorded in the present study. Enyalius brasiliensis
is typical of forested environments, and was relatively abundant in
the area in comparison with other forest remnants in the
state of Rio de Janeiro, based on short-term (Morro São
João; Almeida-Gomes et al. 2008) or mid-term studies (Guapiaçu Ecological
Reserve; Almeida-Gomes & Rocha 2014a). Ecpleopus gaudichaudii is a Gymnophtalmidae
endemic to the Atlantic Forest, which is typically a major
component of local leaf-litter reptile communities (e.g., Dixo & Verdade
2006, Almeida-Gomes & Rocha 2014a, Cruz et al. 2014).
