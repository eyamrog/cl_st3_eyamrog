I will also put this divergence aside here, as I
am in fact interested in investigating the proximity/similarity between the
apposition in (11)a and the data in (1), which I
aim to analyze specifically in this paper. What is essential,
though, is observing that, in Brazilian Portuguese, the configuration of
the apposition in (11)a is syntactically different from what happens
in (11)b, as the latter is constituted by a relative
clause, but not the former3.
