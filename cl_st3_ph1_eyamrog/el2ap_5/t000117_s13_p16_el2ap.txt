We now highlight the National Education Guidelines and Basic Law
(LDBEN) no 9.394, of 1996, not to analyze it as
a regulator of Brazilian education, but as a discursive event
that ratifies the reports by Edgar Faure (1973) and Jacques
Delors (1998). Right from the start we bring attention to
the scope of the LDBEN, as the legal text formulates
the formative processes of the subject, in Title 1, Of
Education, art. 1: “Education encompasses the formative processes that are
developed in familial life, in human living together, at work,
in the teaching and research institutions, in social movements and
in civil society organizations and in cultural manifestations” (Brasil, 1996).
