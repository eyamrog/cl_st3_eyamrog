We searched for amphibians and reptiles in the Sector A
of the park over a 36-month period, between January 2013
and December 2015, at altitudes between 400 m and 800
m a.s.l. The searches were based on the Visual Encounter
Survey (VES) method of Crump & Scott (1994), and resulted
in a total sampling effort of 460 person-hours, with 230
hours of diurnal and 230 hours of nocturnal searches. When
conducting an active search, always two researchers moved through the
forest searching systematically for amphibians and reptiles in microhabitats such
as streams, ponds, bromeliads, the leaf litter, tree trunks, and
rocks. The searches were conducted only in a single direction,
to avoid the resampling of individuals, thus guaranteeing the independence
of the records. All individuals encountered during searches were captured,
identified, and most of them released at the capture site.
We collected voucher specimens, which we deposited in the herpetological
collection of the Museu Nacional (MNRJ), Universidade Federal do Rio
de Janeiro (voucher number in Appendix 1). We complemented our
inventory with secondary records, which included data from herpetological collections
(Appendix 2), and from a faunal reintroduction project for the
PNT. We applied the scientific nomenclature proposed by Frost (2020)
for the amphibian species. For the reptiles, we used the
nomenclature of Costa and BÃ©rnils (2018), which we updated whenever
necessary, based on Poe et al. (2017) and Hoogmoed et
al. (2019).
