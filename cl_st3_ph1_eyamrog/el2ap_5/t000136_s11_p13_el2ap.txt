This hypothesis regards the understanding that the political, legal and
regulatory system (Jensen, 1993), operated by the State, helps NPO
to perform their social function and a favorable reputation. Hence,
donors would tend to transfer more resources to NPO with
such certifications, because of the additional requirements for getting them.
NPO’ funding is volatile, as it depends on external donors
(Verbruggen et al., 2011). This fact explains why NPO seek
a certification, which is a measure of good management for
presenting to donors (to strengthen their image and achieve recognition).
In this sense, Feng et al. (2016) and Desai and
Yetman (2015) showed that certifications and legal requirements, respectively, are
associated with the increase of donations. On the other hand,
Lee (2016) suggests that state regulation does not affect the
adoption of good governance policies by NPO, showing that requirements
for reporting and registration generally have little effect on NPO’
adoption of good governance policies. The following section presents the
methodological procedures adopted in the study.
