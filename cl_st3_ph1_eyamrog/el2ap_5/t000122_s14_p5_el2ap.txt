Tetrasporophyte plant thalli (3 cm in primary axis length with
lateral branches, weighing 200 mg ± 20, n = 5
per treatment) of B. binderi were washed with distilled water
and immersed in liquid detergent based on sulfonic acid 5%
(w/w) (Fernandes et al. 2011) during 60 seconds (Saminathan et
al. 2014). Posteriorly, the detergent was completely removed from the
thalli by several washing with sterilized seawater. Then, thalli were
immersed in 1% povidone iodine (POVIDINE ®) (Saminathan et al.
2014, Ali et al. 2018) for: 15 seconds (treatment 1),
30 seconds (treatment 2), 1 min (treatment 3) and 2
min (treatment 4). Other thalli were immersed in sodium hypochlorite
(0.2% active chlorine L-1 of deionized water) (Holdt et al.
2014) for: 1 min (treatment 5), 2 min (treatment 6)
and 5 min (treatment 7). The chemical solutions were completely
removed from all thalli by several washing with sterilized seawater.
A control (n = 5) was performed with thalli that
were not washed with distilled water and immersed in any
of the tested substances.
