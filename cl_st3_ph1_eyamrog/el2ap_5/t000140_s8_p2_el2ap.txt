By the second decade of the twenty-first century, however, as
surelock-bound paper coursepacks continued to be sold to students, scholarly
publishing had largely moved to cloud-based online access through institutional
licensing to university libraries, and with a small but growing
proportion of open access materials. This digital transformation of scholarly
publishing has only heightened distinctions between scholarly publishing – rooted
in the sponsored economy of academic life – and trade
publishing as a commercial enterprise (Willinsky, 2017). A prime example
of this difference in historical terms is how scholarly authors
are paid by universities supported, in part, by student tuition,
with their scholarly publishing qualifying them for employment and advancement.
In trade publishing, authors largely finance themselves through publishing by
the sale of their books and the placement of their
work in media outlets. What has happened in the digital
era is that scholarly journals have gone online, along with
many scholarly books, with libraries purchasing institutional licenses to these
works that could serve a university’s entire community in a
way that a single copy of a journal or a
book could not. In addition, a growing, if still small,
proportion of journals and books are published or made available
through repositories on an open access basis. This has resulted
in close to a third of the research journal literature
being made freely available by 2017, with a much smaller
but also growing segment of scholarly books following that trend
(Piwowar et al., 2018).1
