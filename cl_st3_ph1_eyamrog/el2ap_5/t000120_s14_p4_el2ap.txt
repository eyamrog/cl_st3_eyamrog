Laboratory Analysis - the organic matter was determined through the
muffle furnace method (Goldin 1987), with the following modifications: 10
grams from each soil sample were weighed in porcelain crucibles
and subsequently dried in an oven at 90 ºC for
24 hours. The samples were then weighed again and placed
in a muffle furnace and incinerated at a temperature of
550 ºC for one hour. Finally, the crucibles containing the
sample residues were weighed as to determine the weight of
the organic matter therein.
