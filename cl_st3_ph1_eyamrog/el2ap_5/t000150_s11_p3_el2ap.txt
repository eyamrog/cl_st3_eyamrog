In both cases, what family is, it is contingent. It
is contingent because either it is irrelevant or family is
presupposed as some underlying model uncritically smuggled into the machinery.
Obviously, the underlying model of family is a Western model
based on the nuclear family, on the consanguinity and the
importance of the biological. However, if we take the kinship
itself as a machinery to think migration, our concerns about
what "family" is cannot be contingent: they are central. The
first thing to note is that family is a bad
name from the start: kinship relationships of the most varied
order are left behind when we talk about family. Family
carries too much the Western responsibility of being an effective
gear. And even the definition of kinship must be redesigned
to escape the old traps of anthropological knowledge.
