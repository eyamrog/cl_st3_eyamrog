In this context, the National Policy for Special Education from
the Perspective of Inclusive Education (PNEE-EI/08) aims to improve the
learning of special education students in Brazil (disabilities, developmental disorders,
and giftedness) and to encourage their participation and access to
regular schools by promoting responses to their educational needs (Brasil,
2008). With this in mind, implemented the Specialized Educational Service
Classrooms (AEE), the Special and Inclusive Education Centers (NUEEI), and
Giftnedess Service Centers (NAAHS).
