The information presented in this study shows that the semiarid
livestock fields of the Middle Valley of the RÃ­o Negro
maintain the native vegetation representative of the Monte ecoregion. The
Asteraceae family contributes the largest number of species (60 sp.),
followed by Poaceae (47 sp.), Fabaceae (26 sp.), Solanaceae (18
sp.), Verbenaceae (12 sp.) and Chenopodiaceae (10 sp.). A total
of 72% of the native species are consumed by cattle,
and 66% of exotic species are toxic or potentially toxic.
The introduction of exotic species has been limited to sectors
that with more disturbance, either from maintenance work or by
different vehicles used on the field. This characteristic is more
marked in the Riparian Zone.
