In step with Sarstedt, Ringle, Cheah, Ting, Moisescu & Radomir
(2020) and Schamberger, Schuberth, Henseler & Dijkstra (2020), a further
analysis was conducted so that the present article can confirm
that the data does not contain outliers with the potential
to distort the results of structural equation models (Cook’s distance),
the relationships of model are linear (Linktest) and the model
has no omitted constructs bias are omitted (RESET for omitted
variables). At first, the model was estimated in order to
implement the tests, using the resulting construct scores as input
for it. Outliers were not identified (D < 1), evidencing
the linear effect’s robustness (p-value = 0.09) and that omitted
variables bias does not occur (p- value = 0.31).
