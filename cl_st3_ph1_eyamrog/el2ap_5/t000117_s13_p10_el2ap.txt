The report of the International Commission for the Development of
Education for UNESCO, titled Learn to be: the education of
the future, was organized in 1973 by the former French
minister Edgar Faure. Written in collaboration with other authors, the
report presented a panorama of world education as it was
and its tasks in the face of the scientific and
technological development of that time. Some concepts in the texts,
such as “learn to be”, “educational city”, “continuous and permanent
education”, will be mentioned again in another report for UNESCO,
organized, this time, by another Frenchman, Jacques Delors, and published
in 1996 under the title Learning: the treasure within, almost
30 years after the report organized by Faure (1973).
