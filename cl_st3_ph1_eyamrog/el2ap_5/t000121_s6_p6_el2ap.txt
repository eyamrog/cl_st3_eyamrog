As limitations of the present study, the sample is not
directly generalizable, given its non-randomization; however, its size helps to
provide greater reliability to the findings and increases the likelihood
of replicability. The results were obtained mainly in the Brazilian
Northeast and with groups with specific demographic characteristics, i.e. women
and high level of scholarity. Furthermore, although meta-worry is an
important explanatory variable, other potentially important mediators were not measured,
such as tolerance to anxiety and coping strategies, making it
impossible to investigate whether, even with a high level of
worry, such variables would mitigate the chance of belonging to
positive groups. Thus, it is suggested that future studies include
mediators in the analysis in order to better understand the
predictive capacity of meta-worry in anxiety and depression. In addition,
considering the different phases of social isolation and consequences of
the pandemic, it is pertinent that longitudinal studies monitor its
impact on the mental health of individuals during and after
the pandemic.
