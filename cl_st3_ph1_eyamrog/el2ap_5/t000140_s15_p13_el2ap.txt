The differences in the assignment of readings among the three
areas have a bearing on assumptions about levying a common
tariff on every student, which we will return in the
discussion. Consideration might also be given to the pedagogical implications
of the relative rarity of assigning journal articles in science,
in which students are not as frequently engaging directly with
recent research as in the social sciences and the humanities.
