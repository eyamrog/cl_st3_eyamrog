Distance education has given the significant portion of the Brazilian
population living in precarious socioeconomic conditions a new level of
access to higher education. In Brazil, distance education has a
much lower cost than on-site classes, and the institutions that
offer this modality can go beyond urban centres and reach
even the most distant regions of the country. This modality
also suits many socially vulnerable groups as it allows them
to work alongside their studies.
