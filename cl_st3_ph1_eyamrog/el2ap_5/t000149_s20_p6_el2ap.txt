Although the richness of forage grasses is high, the role
of shrub species in consumption is very notable. Preliminary data
from microhistological samples of the cattle feces (Klich & Peralta
2019; Klich et al. unpublished) revealed that some taxa, such
as Lycium L., Larrea, Schinus L., Prosopis L., Elaeagnus angustifolia,
Atriplex lampa (Moq.) D.Dietr. and Ephedra ochreata Miers, are consumed
with the same or similar frequency as many species of
grasses. This is interesting because they are species with a
high abundance in the community of the Monte ecoregion. Another
characteristic to highlight is that more than 70% of the
species consumed are native (Fig. 3b).
