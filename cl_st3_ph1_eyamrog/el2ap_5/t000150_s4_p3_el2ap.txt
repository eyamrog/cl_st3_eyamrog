And what these examples tell us about the family and
the migrant kinship is ultimately something we should stand out
as central to a number of migrant experiences: the set
of relationships involving more affective, moral and financial investment are
the relations of kinship that are not obvious, though. These
do not follow any model: the same nationality produces different
kinships in Portugal, depending on where you invest emotionally: either
in Portuguese networks or in the maintenance of the home
networks; the same historical process, such as the migration of
Okinawans to Brazil, followed by the migration of their descendants
to Japan, more than half a century later, generated three
distinct kinship systems that have been changing and significantly affecting
the life experience of these people. We, therefore, restate an
ethnographic approach to give any meaning to the different notions
of family that migration entails, produces and transforms throughout its
course.
