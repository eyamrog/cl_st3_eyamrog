Results observed in this study indicate that only 5% liquid
detergent for 60 seconds is not effective for surface decontamination
of species of Bostrychia, because in immersion treatments in this
compound and 1% povidone iodine there was no elimination of
contaminating organisms. Although immersion treatments in this compound and 0.2%
sodium hypochlorite have been effective, suggesting that 0.2% sodium hypochlorite
is effective for surface decontamination of macroalgae. However, 5% liquid
detergent is relevant for removing fat tiers on contaminating organisms,
contributing to the action of sodium hypochlorite (Holdt et al.
2014).
