This study presents some limitations. As we did not have
access to the explanatory notes of all Financial Statements, it
was not possible to distinguish types of donors (e.g. government
donors, private foundations, corporate foundations). Different types of donors may
have different motivations for donation (Kuti, 2008); thus, we cannot
rule out that the type of donor may influence the
relationship between governance and donations.
