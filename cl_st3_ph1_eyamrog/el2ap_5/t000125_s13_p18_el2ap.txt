It is clear that the lines are very similar, with
small improvements in some indicators in the years 2019 and
2020, in particular in the first two Indicators (1 -
Bachelor graduation rate and 2 - Masters graduation rate) and
in the Indicators 24 to 27 (24 - Foreign language
bachelor programmes, 25 - Foreign language master programmes, 26 -
Student mobility, 27 - International academic staff). It means that
the availability of data is increasing, but it is still
far from ideal. Note that only 12 indicators, of the
35 possible (34.29 %), have more the 90% of data
available in at least one of the years. When studying
the performances of the Brazilian Institution, we will concentrate on
those 12 Indicators, to have an idea of the performances
of those Institutions when the information is reported.
