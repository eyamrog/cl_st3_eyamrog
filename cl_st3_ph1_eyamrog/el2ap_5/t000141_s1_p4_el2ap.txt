MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Knowing governmental strategies, adopted in the easing of
restrictive measures, in the face of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic
based on indicators and with the possibility of comparison between
different federative units, provides subsidies for understanding the outcome of
the disease by place of occurrence, allowing the construction of
a panorama pathology in the country. The appropriation of the
findings of this study by Brazil and other countries also
serves as an instrument for reflection and planning of policies
adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic.
