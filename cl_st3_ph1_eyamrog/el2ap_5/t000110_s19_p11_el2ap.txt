Eunotia longicamelus L.F.Costa, D.C.Bicudo & C.E.Wetzel was established by Costa
et al. (2017b) on the basis of material gathered from
the Ponte Nova Reservoir (Southeastern Brazil). E. longicamelus is widely
identified and cited as E. camelus Ehrenberg, however, the first
species shows narrower valves, dorsal margin with two or four
major undulations, and less concave ventral margin (Costa et al.
2017b). The species was reported from 11% of the core
samples, reaching 2.5% maximum abundance, and occurring since the end
of the Mid-Holocene, from ~5.192 cal. yr BP up to
the core top. Current survey is the first report of
this species occurrence in the Brazilian Amazon.
