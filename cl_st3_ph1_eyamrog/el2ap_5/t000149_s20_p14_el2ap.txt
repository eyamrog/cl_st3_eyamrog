Figure 5 shows the relationship between the species consumed and
their origin; PP and FE showed the highest percentage of
native species consumed (Fig. 5a-b). A higher number of species
of a shrub or sub-shrub habit was consumed than for
the grasses (PP: 33 sp. shrubs or sub-shrubs and 25
sp. of grasses; FE: 20 sp. and 15 sp. respectively).
The RZ (Fig. 5d), on the other hand, had a
low percentage of native species that were consumed, which were
mostly herbaceous (25 sp. herbaceous dicots, 8 sp. grasses), contrasting
with that obtained for the total area (Fig. 3b).
