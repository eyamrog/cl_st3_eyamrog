Following the advice of the WHO, Brazil’s Ministry of Health
mandated social isolation and the Ministry of Education suspended by
Decree nº 343/2020 (Federative Republic of Brazil 2020c) classes in
the education system and authorized the use of Information and
Communication Technologies (ICT) to continue classes during the academic year,
in line with policies adopted in other large nations such
as China (Zhu and Liu 2020; Daniel 2020). 182,600 institutions
suspended on-site classes, leaving 47 million Brazilian students in primary,
secondary and tertiary education without classes. Like 850 million students
in 191 countries they had to adapt to a new
reality of remote or no classes (Mustafa 2020).
