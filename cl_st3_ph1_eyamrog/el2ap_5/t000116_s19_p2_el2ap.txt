Visual inspection only suggests changes between periods, but it is
not a determining factor in assessing consistency. Then, we checked
if the differences in the means were significant (Table 1).
The average rates of hospitalization for conditions sensitive to primary
care decreased significantly between the previous period and during the
reform of primary care in Rio de Janeiro (Post-Hoc p-value
<0.001). The average continued to decline in the period following
the publication of the new national primary care policy. However,
it was not a significant reduction compared to the reform
stage. (Post-Hoc p-value = 0.504). We found that this pattern
was similar for specific hospitalizations for bacterial pneumonia, hypertension, cerebrovascular
diseases, diabetes mellitus and gastrointestinal ulcer.
