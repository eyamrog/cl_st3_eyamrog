In face of the challenges brought in by the modern
life style, in which we live under imminent threats to
biological and cultural diversity, under the consequences of urbanization and
the immuring of childhood, it is our task as educators
to rethink our responsibility with the world where we live
and with the generations who will inherit it. The schools
in the forest movement seems to be an answer to
such challenges. (Casanova, 2019, p. 66-67)
