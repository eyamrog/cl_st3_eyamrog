Focusing now in the Dimension Regional Engagement (purple), we see
that it has five Indicators. Only Regional joint publications is
obtained from open sources. The others comes from the data
given by the Institutions. They are: Bachelor graduates working in
the region, Student internships in the region, Income from regional
sources and Master graduates working in the region. There is
also a large amount of missing data in this Dimension,
with sixteen of the twenty Institutions having only data for
the Indicator obtained from open sources (Regional joint publications). It
is a result of poor data report. ESPM has the
best results, both in terms of data available (four Indicators
with data) and performance (3 A and 1 B). The
second one is Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul,
with 2 A.
