The absence of a unified database, which brings together the
strategies adopted in each state and allows comparisons to be
made, makes public management difficult. A significant number of states
have presented reopening plans with clear, documented, and communicated indicators
to the population, especially concerning the spread of the virus
and the health system's capacity. However, other vital parameters, mainly
about testing and regionalization of measures, were little used. Given
the deep need to plan the economic recovery, most of
the plans remained below the adequate level, exposing the population
and the public administrators to disorderly decisions that are being
made without the necessary transparency to meet democratic principles.
