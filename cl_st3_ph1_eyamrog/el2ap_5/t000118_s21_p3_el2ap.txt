Vriesea altobocainensis is a remarkable species from the Atlantic Forest
of Serra da Bocaina. It is characterized by the robust
habit, infundibuliform rosettes, inflorescences branches patent, with the apical portion
of the branches ascending to slightly sigmoid [as documented in
some species of Alcantarea (E. Morren ex Mez) Harms], red
primary and floral bracts, and distichous flowers. Although this species
is tipically an epiphyte, it can be found growing on
the soil when falling from the forest canopy.
