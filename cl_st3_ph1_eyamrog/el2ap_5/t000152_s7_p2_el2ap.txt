We approach the subject as a teacher in public and
private higher education who follows daily the difficulties students experience
continuing in their courses and coping with the uncertainty of
access as a result of the pandemic. The question that
guides this paper is “What is the impact of COVID-19
on access to and retention in higher education among people
in situations of social vulnerability in Brazil?”. My presupposition is
that the pandemic and its impacts will result in increased
dropout, reduced access, and consequently greater exclusion of students from
higher education in the short, medium, and long terms.
