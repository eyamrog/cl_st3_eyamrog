Regarding the document creation teams, of the 18 states whose
normatives were analyzed, eight (Alagoas, Amapá, Ceará, Mato Grosso, Rio
Grande do Norte, Rondônia, Santa Catarina, and Sergipe) did not
explain who they were and their respective competencies (Table 2).
The documents from Piauí, Espírito Santo, and Pará clarified the
multiple configuration of the document creation teams, being formed by
technicians and researchers/teachers in the first two (Piauí and Espírito
Santo), and by technicians, researchers/teachers, and community members in the
last state (Pará). Finally, seven states (Acre, Mato Grosso do
Sul, Minas Gerais, Paraíba, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do
Sul, São Paulo) presented documents created by a technical team
formed by employees of state health departments.
