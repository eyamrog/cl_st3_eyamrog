The conclusion is, then: what we call here nominal appositive
clauses (example in (15)) and appositive relative clauses (what is
found in (16)), though semantically similar, are syntactically divergent. Those
differences will prove crucial when implementing the analysis of the
wh- sentences being focused in the present paper.
