It is fundamental to invest in the purpose of bringing
down the walls and conquer the spaces that lie beyond
the school walls, not only classrooms, but all places are
propitious to learning: yards, gardens, fields, animal farms, springs, beaches,
dunes, open fields; everything that is in the surroundings, the
neighborhood, the city, its geographic formations, historical and picturesque sites,
the mountains, the seaâ€¦ Besides constituting themselves as spaces for
free play and relaxation, such places can also be exploited
as the environment where one listens to stories, draws and
paints, learning spaces in which a range of knowledges are
developed. (Barros, 2018, p. 23. Bold added)
