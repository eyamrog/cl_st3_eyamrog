In many parts of the world, excellence in research is
associated with publishing in English. This can be particularly problematic
for areas such as the Social Sciences and Humanities or
Public and Collective Health, which are geared towards research into
matters of national or regional interest. We have seen that
publishing in English and in prestige journals is a factor
that attracts more citations and has a "higher impact" than
in any other native language[3]. Our findings at SciELO CI
show that Brazil receives a considerable number of citations, even
when its research work is published in the native language
(Fig. 2B) or in Spanish (Fig. 1B). This “regional impact”
should not be ignored by the science policymakers. Understanding the
dynamics of the citations and the scope of publication in
the native language, can assist in the definition of fairer
and more responsible scientific policy strategies that do not make
them invisible.
