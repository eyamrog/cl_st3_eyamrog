The genus Bostrychia Montagne belongs to Rhodomelaceae (Rhodophyta) and includes
macroalgae with distribution in temperate and tropical regions, occurring in
continental aquatic and marine environments, mainly in salt marshes and
mangroves (King & Puttock 1989). Species of Bostrychia form the
structure of the mangrove community known as Bostrychietum. This term
was proposed by Post (1936) and includes mainly rhodophytes as
Bostrychia, Caloglossa (Harvey) G. Martens and Catenella Greville, but also
cyanobacteria and chlorophytes which associate themselves to pneumatophores of Avicennia
L., to rhizophores and stems of Rhizophora L. and Laguncularia
