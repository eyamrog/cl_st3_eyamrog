This situation has given way, in the last few years,
to the criminal accusation of at least fifteen young and
poor women, accused of having had an abortion (Centro de
Estudios Legales y Sociales, CELS, 2017). Conscientious objection is frequent
in health institutions and, on occasion, it takes place in
a general manner in an entire department, thus becoming one
of the major obstacles to provide the service of abortion.
The existence of professionals who are conscientious objectors contributes to
the stigma of abortion and promotes the idea that abortion
is banned (Fiala y Arthur 2014; Morán Faúndes y Peñas
Defagó 2016).
