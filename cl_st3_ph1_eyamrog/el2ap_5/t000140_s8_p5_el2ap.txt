In 2019, when Canada’s Standing Committee on Industry, Science and
Technology issued its Statutory Review of the Copyright Act Report,
it included a recommendation that in part inspired this study,
namely that the committee “resume its review of the implementation
of educational fair dealing in the Canadian educational sector within
three years, based on new and authoritative information as well
as new legal developments” (Ruimy, 2019). This study seeks to
provide new and authoritative information on this area of educational
fair dealing that bear on past court rulings and might
inform future ones, as well as the Copyright Act. It
examines how old and new distinctions between scholarly and trade
publishing might reasonably figure in calculating what is owed to
whom as a result of student engagement with both types
of literature in their university courses.
