These syllabuses come from 34 of Canada’s 96 universities located
in nine of Canada’s ten provinces (minus Prince Edward Island).
The distribution of syllabuses among institutions ran from a high
of 386 syllabuses (11.4% of total) collected from Western University
to the two (0.1%) collected from Kwantlen Polytechnic University, with
a mean of 99.7 syllabuses per university. Of the 3,391
syllabuses, 86.3 percent (2,926) are in English and 13.7 percent
(465) are in French. Courses in science accounted for 42.6
percent (1,443) of the syllabuses, the social sciences 37.1 percent
(1,258), and the humanities 20.3 percent (690). No distinction is
made between graduate and undergraduate course syllabuses as the Access
Copyright tariff applies to all university students. While we were
unable to locate a reliable source of information on how
many courses are taught in Canada annually, if Canada’s roughly
1.3 million full-time university students may be assumed to be
taking 8.2 courses a year (see below fn 6) in
classes averaging 25 students across the country, then this sample
of 3,391 syllabuses amounts to less than 0.9 percent of
the courses offered annually 2015-2020 (Postsecondary enrollments, 2018).
