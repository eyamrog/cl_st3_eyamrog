Eunotia superbidens Lange-Bertalot is very similar to Eunotia praerupta Ehrenberg
(1843: 414), regarding their size, but differ in the presence
of a single undulation on the dorsal margin, and the
greater striae density. The species also differs from Eunotia bigibba
KÃ¼tzing (1849: 6) mainly by the more depressed undulations and
its larger valves. This species was rarely met during the
present investigation, being distributed in 2% of the core samples
and reaching 1% maximum abundance. It is present in samples
from the Late Holocene (~1.514 cal. yr BP). Current investigation
is the first report of the presence of the species
in the Brazilian Amazon.
