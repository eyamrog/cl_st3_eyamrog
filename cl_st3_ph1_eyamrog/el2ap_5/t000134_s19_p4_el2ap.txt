Overall, 30 of the amphibian (ca. 80% of the total)
and ten of the reptile species (28%) recorded in the
PNT are endemic to the Atlantic Forest biome (Tables 1
and 2). Six of these amphibians – Aplastodiscus albofrenatus, Dendrophryniscus
brevipollicatus, Euparkerella brasiliensis, Hylodes nasus, Ischnocnema guentheri, and Scinax trapicheiroi
– are considered endemic to the state of Rio de
Janeiro. Most of the amphibian and reptile species are listed
as Least Concern or Not Threatened in the three lists
of conservation status (international, Brazilian, and state). Six amphibian and
one reptile species recorded in the PNT are listed under
some category of extinction threat. The populations of 15 amphibian
species are thought to be declining (Table 1). Two of
the reptile species, the lizard Hemidactylus mabouia and the chelonian
Trachemys scripta are exotic (Table 2).
