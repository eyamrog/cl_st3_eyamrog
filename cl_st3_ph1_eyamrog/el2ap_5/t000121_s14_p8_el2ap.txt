The PHQ-4 screening diagnoses were categorized by combining the presence
of a single or simultaneous diagnosis (i.e. four groups: anxiety,
depression, just one or both diagnosis). Thus, each group was
used as a dependent variable (presence or absence of symptoms)
in separated four logistic regression models. In the evaluation of
each model, the following indicators were observed: Omnibus test (expected
to be statistically significant), Nagelkerke’s R² (the higher the better,
corresponding to the explained variance of the final model), the
Hosmer- Lemeshow test (expected not to be statistically significant), and
correct predictive capacity of the model (expected around 70%). The
multicollinearity assessment was performed for all models and no problems
were found in the composition or final solution of the
models. It is worth noting that all Odds Ratio (OR)
values below 1 were converted by the formula 1/OR for
purposes of standardizing the description of the findings. Significance was
set at p < 0.05 for all steps of binomial
and multinomial regressions.
