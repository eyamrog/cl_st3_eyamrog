A look at Fig. 2 shows that University of Campinas,
Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul and Unesp
have data available in six of the seven Indicators, a
very good number. In the lower limit side, we see
that there is one Institution that has data available in
only three Indicators (Rio de Janeiro State University) and the
other 16 have at least four Indicators with data available.
Regarding the grades, Unesp (3 A, 1 B, 2 D)
and University of Campinas (3 A, 1 B, 1 C,
1D) have the best performances in this Dimension. State University
of Maringá, Federal University of São Carlos, Federal University of
Pernambuco and University of São Paulo are the next ones,
with 2 A each.
