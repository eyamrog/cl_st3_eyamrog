In the case of migration, we have several machines operating
more or less in an objectified manner. But this speech
is not to criticize today's most hegemonic models. The intention
is to think the place of "family" in this machinery,
i.e., how the family is a gear in the machinery
of explanations based on networks and transnational theory. Being a
gear, what do we leave behind when family is only
one piece in the machinery? And if, alternatively, we think
of a machinery based on kinship idea, what is revealed?
