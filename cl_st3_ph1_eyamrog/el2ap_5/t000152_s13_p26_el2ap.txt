The discontinuity of class schedules, loss or extension of semesters
in public HEIs, the impossibility of carrying out internship activities
in public and private HEIs, and various other uncertainties caused
by the pandemic take a heavy toll on students. The
need to deal with illness, death and social isolation has
had severe psycho-emotional impacts on students who saw their routines
changed and/or had to assume family responsibilities even while grieving
(Sahu 2020; Vieira 2020).
