This result disagrees with Feng, Neely and Slatten (2016), who
identified that the certification Standards for ExcellenceÂ® was associated with
the increase of donations, compared to a control group of
NPO that did not receive the same certification. However, this
certification is granted by the Maryland Association of Nonprofit Organizations,
and the requirements for getting and keeping it are more
rigorous than for the other certifications considered in this study
(OS, OSCIP and CEBAS). It does not confirm either the
results of Desai and Yetman (2015), who found that the
legal and report requirements demanded from NPO moderated the relationship
between the percentage of changes in charitable spending and the
percentage of changes in program revenues. These findings support the
notion that state regulation, through additional requirements for certification, helps
NPO to play their social role. On the other hand,
results by Lee (2016), with data from the National Center
for Charitable Statistics, suggest that state regulation does not affect
the adoption of good governance policies by NPO. NPO that
operate in states that demand reporting and registration were no
more susceptible to adopting accountability policies than organizations that act
in states that have no such requirements.
