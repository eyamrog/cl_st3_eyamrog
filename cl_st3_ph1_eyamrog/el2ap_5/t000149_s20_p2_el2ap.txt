Table 1 lists the 59 families of plants present in
the study area, showing the number of species for each
one and their percentage of representativeness. The most represented family
is the Asteraceae with 20% of the total species. It
is followed by, in descending order, the Poaceae representing 15.66%
of the species, Fabaceae (8.66%), Solanaceae (6%), Verbenaceae (4%) and
Chenopodiaceae (3.33%). There are also 47 families that have less
than 2% representation, including, for example, the Zygophyllaceae (4 sp.,
1.33%), Anacardiaceae (2 sp., 0.66%), and Elaeagnaceae (1 sp., 0.33%)
that have a high abundance of individuals.
