In order to confirm that the series that were determined
to have unit roots by nonlinear unit root tests (Table
3) are stationary in I1, the ADF and PP tests
were applied by taking their first differences (Table 4). Following
the determination of the stationarity of the series at I1,
cointegration tests were performed.
