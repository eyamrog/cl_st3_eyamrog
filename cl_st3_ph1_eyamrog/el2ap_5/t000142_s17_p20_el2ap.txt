Leybourne, Newbold & Vougas (LNV) (1998)40, who suggested gradual integration
of structural changes to the model with a smooth transition
instead of instantaneous integration, developed a unit root test as
an alternative to the unit root tests with structural breaks.
This test, in which structural breakage is taken into account
with a logistic function, allows smooth structural transitions and constitutes
the beginning of nonlinear tests. Logistic soft transition regressions were
created by defining three models;
