Emerging countries, like Brazil, still face an agenda that involves
an epidemiological transition caused by an aging population and a
triple burden of diseases or health conditions defined by acute
health conditions (infectious diseases), external causes and health conditions that
need continuous care, organized based on a strong PHC structure
14. PHC services in Brazil are still largely focused on
addressing acute conditions and are largely inefficient in healthcare conditions
that require continuous care. 15
