Tropical forests provide key ecosystem services to humans, conserve biodiversity
and regulate the climate (Berenguer et al. 2018). The practice
of burning, the complete removal of natural vegetation, the inadequate
preparation of the soil for agricultural use and exploitation, without
the replacement of organic matter or nutrients from the soil,
are examples of actions that directly impact the soil (SBCS
2015). Deforestation can cause soil exposure, increased vulnerability to erosive
processes (Flores et al. 2019) and loss of biodiversity (Berenguer
et al. 2018), rendering the soil impacted but still capable
to regenerate naturally (IBAMA 2011). In order to restore a
disturbed area, ecological restoration is a form of human intervention
used to trigger or accelerate natural succession (Secretaria do Meio
Ambiente do Estado de SÃ£o Paulo 2014). It is based
on the reestablishment of ecological processes without relying on traditional
forestry techniques; it seeks to emulate nature, using minimal inputs
and restoring the health, integrity and sustainability of the ecosystem
through practices implemented in partial areas, called nuclei (Bechara 2006).
