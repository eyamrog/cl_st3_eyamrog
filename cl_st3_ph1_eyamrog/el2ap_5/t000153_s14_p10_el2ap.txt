In this work, we understand the stigma of abortion as
“the discrediting of individuals as a result of their association
with abortion” (Norris et al., 2011, p.49), and we focused,
specifically, on how it is carried by healthcare providers. To
account for the dynamics with which it operates in real
situations, stigma has been defined by taking into account a
convergence of interrelated components, which span the labeling that people
make of human differences, the creation of stereotypes and their
association with negative attributes linked to the people so labelled,
the consequent separation between “them” and “us”, and the disapproval,
rejection and discrimination that unfold in conjunction with a power
relationship that fosters their growth (Link y Phelan 2001; Phelan,
Link y Dovidio 2008). For stigmatization to occur, there must
be exercised (or accessed) social, economic and political power, permitting
the emergence, the construction and the cultural sustainment of difference
through socially- built categories (Link y Phelan 2001). Power, then,
becomes essential to guarantee the existence of stigma.
