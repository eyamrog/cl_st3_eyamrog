Therefore, these products should now be replaced by natural ones,
which present a lower degree of toxicity, being more economically
viable and more accessible to the population (VOLKART; SPAGIARI; BIZZANI,
2017; NÓBREGA; DANTAS; SILVA, 2010). Among the species of used
plants is the Libidibia ferrea (Febaceae) that is natural of
the Caatinga biome and has been described from the Northeast
to the South of Brazil. It is popularly known as
Pau-ferro, Pau-caí or Jucá (MOTA; FERREIRA; IMAÑA, 2012). The Libidibia
ferrea has antifungal, antibacterial, antiulcerogenic, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, anti-flu, antitussive, anti-asthmatic,
antianemia, antidiarrheal, anticoagulant, analgesic, and healing actions. It is also
a larvicide against the Aedes aegypti, and it is indicated
for feeding animals as in sheep and goat farming, widely
used in rural areas, given the difficulty of food (GOMES
et al., 2017; MOREIRA; OLIVEIRA, 2017; REIS et al., 2017;
PEREIRA et al., 2016; HASSAN et al., 2015; FREITAS et
al., 2015; MAGALHÃES et al., 2014; VÁSQUEZ; MENDONÇA; NODA, 2014;
LIMA et al., 2012; VASCONCELOS et al., 2011).
