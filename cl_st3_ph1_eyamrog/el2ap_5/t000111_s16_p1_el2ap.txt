In a seminal study from 1979, Emonds evaluates the phenomenon
of relative clauses and attest that a free relative could
have appositive content. And it is in fact nonsense thinking
of a free structure (which, by its own nature, should
not relate straightforwardly to some realized syntactic material) that must
somehow be connected to an anchor (hence, an antecedent).
