In the theory of networks (Portes 1995), machinery tries to
overcome the economism of the rational action explanations for migration.
The point is to explain the displacement in terms of
social relations and not the cold calculation of average income
differences. Here, social relationships gain prominence and the family is
a privileged place of social relations: the family is a
fundamental connection of networks, as a primary node of any
migratory network. But the family that emerges from this perspective
is a generic and universal family, disconnected from any anthropological
discussion on kinship. It is assumed a generic family, that
articulates any migratory network in order to then understand the
network and not the structures that give rise to it
(family, friendship, vicinality, all these categories that could be inserted
into what we mean by kinship).
