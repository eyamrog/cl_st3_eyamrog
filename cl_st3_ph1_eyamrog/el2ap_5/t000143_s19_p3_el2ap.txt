Moran Local's Statistics I (Fig. 3) is also of great
importance for the analysis, since it shows the degree of
significance of certain groups. According to the Local Space Association
Indicator (LISA), the municipalities with the highest rates of femicide
are Santa Rosa de Lima and Aquidab√£. The analysis identified
significant LISA sector clusters. The significance of this indicator in
the period considered implies the existence of positive multidirectional externalities
of the rates of femicide in the municipalities of the
State of Sergipe.
