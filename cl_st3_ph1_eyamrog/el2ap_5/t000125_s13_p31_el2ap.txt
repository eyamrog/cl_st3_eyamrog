In the year 2019, showed in Table 4, we notice
an increase in the data reported, in particular in the
“Teaching and Learning” Dimension. We have now five Institutions with
data available in this Dimension, not only two. All those
five Universities have average grades above 1.00 points now. This
fact also changes the order of the top performers. UNESP
São Paulo State University is still the first, but know
it has an average of 2.42 points, a decrease of
0.07 with respect to 2018. The second place is now
State University of Campinas, with an average of 2.05 points,
just 0.01 points ahead of the third place, Federal University
of Ceará. University of São Paulo takes fourth place, with
1.85 points. Federal University of Mato Grosso decreased its position
to fifth place, now with 1.27 points, 0.30 points below
its results in 2018. Federal University of São Paulo, with
1.04 points, completes the list of Brazilian Universities above 1.00
points, in sixth place.
