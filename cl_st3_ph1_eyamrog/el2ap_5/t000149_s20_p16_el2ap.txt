As mentioned at a general level, the highest percentage of
toxic or potentially toxic species is of exotic origin. The
analysis for each of the sites shows that in the
RZ and VP there was a higher percentage of exotic
toxic species than native, but in the PP and FE
the native toxic species (Asclepias mellodora A.St.-Hil., Baccharis ulicina Hook.
& Arn., Euphorbia collina, E. serpens Kunth, E. hieronymi Subils,
Clematis montevidensis Spreng., Nierembergia linariaefolia Graham, Nicotiana noctiflora Hook., Solanum
triflorum Nutt.) presented a higher percentage than the exotic ones
(Fig. 7).
