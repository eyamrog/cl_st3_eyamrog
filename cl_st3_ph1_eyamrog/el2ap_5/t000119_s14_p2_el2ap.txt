To evaluate the effect of saline stress on common rue
seed germination (Ruta graveolens L.), aqueous solution of sodium chloride
(NaCl) and calcium chloride (CaCl2) at concentrations corresponding to zero;
-0.10, -0.20, -0.30, and -0.40 MPa were used. Only distilled
water was utilized as the control at the level zero.
The amount of solution required to obtain osmotic potentials was
calculated by Van't Hoff equation (Braccini et al. 1996, Taiz
& Zeiger 2013).
