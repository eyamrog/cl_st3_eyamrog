Seed germination is an important and vulnerable stage in the
plant cycle and determines seedling establishment and plant growth, and
is influenced by abiotic factors such as temperature, oxygen and
water availability (Carvalho & Nakagawa 2012). Water can be a
limiting factor for non- dormant seed germination, affecting the percentage,
speed and uniformity of the process. Therefore, water is associated
with reserve mobilization and release of energy through respiration, also
encouraging the activity of enzymes and growth regulators. In addition,
the molecule acts on the dilution of protoplasm, favoring metabolism
directed to the resumption of embryonic growth (Marcos Filho 2015).
