I have also tried to show that the quem-sentence in
the data being put into analysis here seems to be
juxtaposed to the anchor, contrary to what happens to ordinary
appositive relative clauses, in which the anchor (the relativized nominal)
is understood to be raised from within the subordinate clause
(see Kayne, 1994). Another characteristic that these quem-sentences seem to
have is that in (1) they can be extraposed, contrary
to what happens to genuine appositive relatives.
