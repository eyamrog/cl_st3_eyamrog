The diversity recently recorded for the state of Espírito Santo
is 492 bryophyte species (486, Costa & Peralta 2015), out
of which 263 are mosses (Flora do Brasil 2020,2021). However,
Yano (2012) cataloged for the state 531 taxa of which
286 are mosses, distributed in 134 genera and 50 families.
Despite the significant decrease in the number of species, which
may come from synonymous taxa or misidentifications, our state remains
among the 10 richest states in the country (Costa &
Peralta 2015, Flora do Brasil 2020 2021). Over the years,
studies conducted in the state have demonstrated the bryoflora’s biodiversity
potential, for example: Peralta & Yano (2011) have listed 89
moss species in the Mello Leitão Museum herbarium and 21
new records for the state. Silva (2011) found 126 moss
species, with 35 new occurrences in Dense Montane and Upper
Montane Ombrophylous Forest. Yano (2016) listed 67 moss taxa in
the state “Tabuleiro” Forests, with 15 new occurrences. And recently,
Faria et al. (2020) published a work carried out in
an Ombrophylous Forest, reporting 102 moss species with 33 species
as new occurrences. In this study, we found almost 1/4
of the recorded moss diversity for Espírito Santo State (Flora
do Brasil 2020 2021) as well as 9 new citations.
Regarding the observed families, Gradstein et al. (2001) describe that
Sematophyllaceae, Leucobryaceae and Bryaceae are among the richest families in
the Neotropics, also in Brazil and in the Atlantic Forest
corroborated by Costa & Peralta (2015) Sematophyllaceae is quite common
in the Atlantic Forest (Silva Rodrigues & Valente 2015, Silva
2012, Valente et al. 2009, Costa & Lima 2005) and
is considered the fifth richest family in Brazil as well
as Bryaceae. The Leucobryaceae family has a wide distribution in
the globe and is commonly found in open environments in
montane rain forests, especially the genus Campylopus (Gradstein et al.
2001), that have adaptations to luminosity and desiccation, such as
hyalocysts (hyaline cells) and hair points (Glime 2007). In fact,
there is a great diversity of bryophytes registered in the
Atlantic Forest, mainly in montane environments.
