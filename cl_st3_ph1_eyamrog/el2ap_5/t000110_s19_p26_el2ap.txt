Caloneis sp. resembles Caloneis sp. NÂº. 163/14 in Metzeltin &
Lange-Bertalot (1998: 560, pl. 163, fig. 14). However, the specimens
from Xingu river present slightly panduriform valves. Further studies are
required to confirm if this taxon is a new species.
During the present study, the taxon was present in 11%
of the core samples, and reached 2.5% maximum abundance, occurring
in samples corresponding to the end of the Mid-Holocene (~5.192
cal. yr BP).
