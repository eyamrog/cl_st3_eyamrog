Similar results were observed by Stefanello et al. (2018) evaluating
the influence of different salt concentrations on common thyme seed
germination (Thymus vulgaris L.). The authors observed a negative effect
of NaCl and CaCl2 salts on seed germination and vigor
from osmotic potentials respectively of -0.3 and -0.2 MPa. Moreover,
Mguis et al. (2011) analyzed common rue seed germination (0
to 0.7 MPa NaCl) and concluded that it was significantly
inhibited by a NaCl concentration greater than 0.1 MPa. Additionally,
Yamashita et al. (2009) found a reduction in the germination
percentage of common rue seeds as NaCl concentration increased. However,
significant reductions were observed only from -0.8 MPa. The lowest
germination percentage value was found at osmotic potential of -1.0
MPa (22%).
