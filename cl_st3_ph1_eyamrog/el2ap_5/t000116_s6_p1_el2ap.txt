The definition of lists of ACSCs generally comprises systematic reviews
of the literature and consensual expert opinions. The Brazilian ACSC
list is one of the most complete globally. These causes
are an important source of pressure for the health system22.
The reduction in the overall rate of ACSC associated with
RCAPS in the city corroborates findings already documented in studies
carried out in Rio de Janeiro21 and in other places
in the country3. Some groups can respond more quickly to
the implementation of PHC services. In the short term, the
most significant access to health services contributes to avoiding hospitalizations
in situations with strong social determination, such as nutritional deficiencies;
and health problems with clinical management at the PHC itself,
such as urinary tract infections; and stabilization of chronic diseases,
such as asthma and hypertension23,24.
