In a recent study, Velez-Cuartas, Lucio-Arias and Leydesdorff [16] compared
the degree of visibility of LAC publications in WoS and
SciELO to determine the dissemination of scientific knowledge in LAC.
They found that LAC scientific communications continued to be written
in in Spanish and Portuguese, and this persistence can be
attributed to the fact that these are the main languages
in the region, owing to the geographical distribution of the
collaborators. Collaborations in LAC are generally mediated by the skills
of developed countries, particularly in Europe. Researchers from LAC countries
play a leading role as first authors in two thirds
of multi-authored papers; in other words, LAC researchers are well
integrated in the global dynamics of science. It has been
found that scientific publications from Latin American countries indexed in
WoS in Open Access (AA), are mainly published in English
(70.37%), followed by Portuguese (17.86%) and Spanish (11.63%) [17]. Other
languages, such as French, Italian and German, represent only 0.19%.
Compared with the distribution of languages within the total number
of LAC publications indexed by WoS, the presence of Spanish
and especially Portuguese is significantly higher in the AA sample
(11.63% and 17.86% as opposed to 7.40% and 7.44%, respectively),
while, as a result, the dominance of English is low
(70.37% as opposed to 84.96% in the total sample). In
contrast, papers indexed in SciELO CI are mainly published in
Spanish (39.60%), followed by Portuguese (33.30%) and English (27.07%). Other
languages account for only 0.03% [17].
