This test, which was introduced to the literature by Banerjee,
Arčabić & Lee (2017)43, is a typical cointegration test expanded
in Fourier terms that takes the delayed structures of both
dependent and independent variables into account. The test is logically
based on error correction. As presented in Equation 34 and
Equation 35, the test includes constant and trend terms, the
delayed value of the independent variable, and the value of
its level the previous period.
