When we think kinship as a machinery to understand migration,
we immediately gain what the current models conceal: the diversity
of relationships that make up the thousands of migrants kinships.
I want to emphasize that the current models assume family
as part of other links of sociological attention, but a
limited, stiffened and rusty idea of family: a family which,
for being so similarly thought, results in an obliteration of
the real diversity of migrants kinships. Let us now learn
three examples that illustrate something of the diversity of migrant
kinships, so as to illustrate how this difference is ignored
by the existing machinery.
