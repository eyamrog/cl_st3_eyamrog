High prevalence of enteroparasites have been recorded in indigenous populations
in Paran√°, ranging from 67% to 95%, according to the
region studied5,9. In Kaingang lands, the frequency of peridomiciliar soil
samples contaminated by enteroparasites of humans or animals with zoonotic
potential ranged from 75.7% to 96.2%8, and water contamination with
waterborne protozoa, such as Giardia spp and Cryptosporidium spp, was
also observed.10 These findings indicate that the treatment of human
and animal excrement in indigenous lands is inadequate and improvements
in sanitation and water treatment, in addition to periodic treatment
of the population with antiparasitic agents, are necessary. 4-10
