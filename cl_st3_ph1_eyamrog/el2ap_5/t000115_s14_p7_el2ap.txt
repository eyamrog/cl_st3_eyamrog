An initial coproparasitological examination (1st examination) was carried out in
November 2018 and a monitoring examination (2nd examination), in May
2019, in order to evaluate the effect of the control
measure applied. The samples, one per person, were processed and
analyzed using three methods of parasitological stool examinations: 1) direct
method, in which the sample was processed with saline solution
to avoid the loss of species of Blastocystis hominis that
might be present in them16; 2) flotation after centrifugation in
zinc sulfate solution17; and 3) spontaneous sedimentation in water18. The
slides were read by an experienced microscopist in 10X and
40X magnification.
