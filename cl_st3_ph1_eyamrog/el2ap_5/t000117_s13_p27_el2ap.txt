What do the teachers do, while the children learn freely
in interaction with the environment and their peers? The teachers,
preferably designated as “educators”, observe the children playing freely, spontaneously.
In the pedagogical proposal formulated in Demmuring Childhood, the preservation
of both nature and childhood is defended, the “natural child”
is shielded from the pedagogical assault by adults, who are
characterized as locked into the “cognitive development paradigm”, into the
idea that “learning only takes place with the body sitting
still”, and to the conception that “the central place of
the educational proposal is the classroom”.
