We collected data through a documentary survey of Financial Statements,
Annual Reports of Activities and Statutes, available at the websites
of NPO, or found in the repository “Map of Civil
Society Organizations”. In addition, we contacted NPO (telephone and email)
for which we were unable to access the documents directly,
using records at the Brazilian National Environment Council (CONAMA).
