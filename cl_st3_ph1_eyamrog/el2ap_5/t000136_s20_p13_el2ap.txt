The presence of formal policies, in a broad sense, can
encourage employees to confidentially report unethical behavior, avoid conflicts of
interest (for example, code of conduct, anti- corruption policy), and
serve as a guide for management practices. As these policies
can improve NPO’s governance, by reducing information asymmetry, they will
increase donors’ confidence that their resources contribute to advance the
NPO’s institutional mission.
