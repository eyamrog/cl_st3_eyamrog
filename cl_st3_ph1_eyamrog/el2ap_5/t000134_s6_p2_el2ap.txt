In comparison with the PNM Serra do Mendanha − other
substantial remnant of dense rainforest in the urban zone of
Rio de Janeiro for which systematic medium-term data are available
− the results of the present study are broadly consistent.
Pontes et al. (2015) recorded 45 amphibians and 39 reptiles
at PNM Serra do Mendanha, values closely comparable with the
38 amphibians and 36 reptiles we recorded at PNT. The
amphibian species richness recorded in the PNT is also relatively
high in comparison with other forested areas in the state
of Rio de Janeiro for which data are available (Table
3). While the species richness recorded at the different sites
fluctuates considerably, it seems likely that much of this variation
is related to differences in survey methods, sampling effort, and
the study period (Table 3).
