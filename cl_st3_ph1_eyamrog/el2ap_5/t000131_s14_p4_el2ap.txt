Chlorophyll fluorescence - The maximum quantum yield of primary photochemistry
(Fv/Fm) was measured in three fully expanded leaves using a
portable fluorometer model OS-3P (ADC BioScientific, UK). Leaves were dark-adapted
for 30 minutes and used to measure the dark fluorescence
yield (Fo), maximum fluorescence yield (Fm), and variable fluorescence (Fv).
Then, Fv/Fm ratio was calculated. We performed four Fv/Fm diurnal
courses from 6:00 hours to 18:00 hours each two hours
at 60, 90, 120, and 150 DAT. At sampling days,
we monitored the relative humidity and ambient temperature using a
hygro-thermometer, and the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) using a
quantum sensor connected to an irradiation meter model LI-250A (LI-COR,
USA) (supplementary material figure S1).
