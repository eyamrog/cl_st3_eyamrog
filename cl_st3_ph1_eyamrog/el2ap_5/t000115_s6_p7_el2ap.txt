Among the indigenous school-children in this study, the age group
most affected was five to nine years, in which it
was observed a significant increase (p = 0.0185) in the
frequency of helminth infection, from 14% to 37.4%, after mass
treatment of the population. Younger children are the most important
risk group, as they are in continuous contact with contaminated
soil and their hygienic habits are not yet properly developed.7
This fact highlights the importance of adopting other control measures
in addition to pharmacological measures. Although there is a recommendation
that, in order to assess parasitological health indicators, the effective
reduction of the parasitic burden is observed19, no quantitative method
was applied during the coproparasitological examinations carried out, constituting a
limitation of this study. This also prevented verifying the impact
of the measure adopted on the intensity of geo-helminth infections.
