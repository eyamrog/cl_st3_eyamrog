In this context, the present work aimed to test the
effectiveness of physical and chemical procedures for surface decontamination of
Bostrychia binderi Harvey. This species was used as model in
order to develop a decontamination protocol for obtaining unialgal cultures
for laboratory studies with this genus. Our hypothesis is that
washing with distilled water, after washing and spraying with sterilized
seawater, physical removing of macrofauna individuals and epiphyte macroalgae, and
thalli immersion treatments in 5% liquid detergent and afterward in
0.2% sodium hypochlorite are effectiveness for surface decontamination of B.
binderi.
