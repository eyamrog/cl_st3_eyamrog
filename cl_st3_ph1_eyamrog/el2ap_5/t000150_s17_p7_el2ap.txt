We can see how Brazilian migrations in Portugal produce completely
distinct realities and the kinship machinery causes this difference to
emerge, which would probably be less important with other machinery.
Both transnationalism and the theory of networks (or variations of
sociology of migrations) would tend to look more at other
processes rather than look at kinship orders producing such different
realities, to an extent that we can say they are
radically different. They are kinship orders producing very dissonant realities.
