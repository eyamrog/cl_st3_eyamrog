Considering the extensive literature in English, various studies confirm the
existence of fear felt by abortion providers regarding the negative
consequences entailed in revealing that they perform abortions. Among such
consequences are the discredit brought upon them, and the labor
abuse they are subject to, on the part of professionals
who oppose abortion. Abortion providers also describe the psychosocial costs
they bear individually, as what is at stake is “assistance”
tasks that provoke stress and physical and emotional fatigue. As
a common analytical axis in all research works, there is
the specification of the negative consequences borne in the personal
and/or professional lives of the human resources who are members
of the healthcare teams that offer this service (Martin, Debbink,
Hassinger, Youatt, 2014; Martin, Debbink, Hassinger, Youatt, Eagen-Torkko, Harris 2014;
Norris, Steinberg, Kavanaugh, De Zordo, Becker 2011; Harris, Debbink, Martin,
Hassinger 2011; O’Donnell, Weitz, Freedman 2011). Research into stigma and
abortion in Latin America is still limited (Zamberlin 2015; Adesse,
Bonnan, Silveira, Matos 2016). For around a decade, research has
been undertaken to focus on showing how women are affected
by the link between stigma and abortions performed in contexts
of legal restrictions (Palomino, Ramos, Davey, Guzmán, Carda y Bayer
2011; Galli y Sydow 2010; Shellenberg, Moore, Bankole, Juarez, Omideyi,
Palomino, Zathar, Shingh, Tsui 2011; Vallejo, Botina, Gómez 2016), while
other works tackle the consequences that stigmatizing attitudes entail for
healthcare workers (De Zordo, 2012; Faúndes, Alves, Duarte, 2013; Vivas,
Valencia, González, 2016).
