The current situation of income and job instability has led
many researchers to rethink the acquisition and maintenance of student
loan debt. Addressing the risks of default, some private institutions
have developed policies to reduce monthly fees during the pandemic
period. Parents, students, and guardians have opened up discussions about
full charges for remote classes, and in one case a
federal state has legally mandated a 30% reduction in tuition
fees (Law 17208/2020; State of Ceará 2020). Similar attempts have
been made in other states but have been quashed by
the federal court. Medical students from a private HEI in
the State of São Paulo filed action to deduct tuition
fees, but the court then reversed. In according Brazilian Association
of Higher Education Administrators (2020b) others proceedings to deduct tuition
fees have been requested but have been rejected by HIE
or did not had negociation up to moment.
