Photosynthetic pigments - The effects of retention of solar radiation
flux on the photosynthetic pigments were similar in both species.
There were significant effects of solar radiances and species on
total chlorophyll and carotenoids for both species (figure 3; supplementary
material table S2). Pigments concentration increased under low light availability.
Plants grew under I0 showed a reduction in chlorophyll and
carotenoids content during the experiment (figure 3 a-d). For M.
glomerata, 5.6 and 4.0-fold more chlorophyll and carotenoids were found
for I75 than I0 treatments at the end of the
experiment (150 DAT) (figure 3 a, c). In M. laevigata
plants, this difference was between 4.9 and 3.6-fold. In this
same sampling, both species under I25 showed an average increase
of 3-fold more chlorophyll and 2.5-fold more carotenoids than plants
under I0 (figure 3 b, d). In both species, higher
values of carotenoids/chlorophyll ratio were observed in plants grown in
I0 compared with plants grown under high levels of shading
(I75) (figure 3 e, f).
