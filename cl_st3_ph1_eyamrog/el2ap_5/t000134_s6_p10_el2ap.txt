Most (ca. 80%) of the amphibian species recorded in the
PNT are endemic to the Atlantic Forest (Rossa- Feres et
al. 2017). This was somewhat expected, as that biome has
a high degree of endemism for amphibians (Haddad et al.
2013). By contrast, only 28% of the reptilian species recorded
are endemic to the Atlantic Forest, although this is also
typical for this group (Tozetti et al. 2017). Six of
the amphibians are also considered to be endemic to the
state of Rio de Janeiro, including two (H. nasus and
I. guentheri) that are endemic to the municipality of Rio
de Janeiro. Hylodes nasus is known to be restricted to
the forests of this municipality, and has, in fact, only
been recorded, up to now, in the PNT (Nascimento et
al. 2001, Lingnau et al. 2008) and the PNM Serra
do Mendanha (Pontes et al. 2015). However, Canedo (2008) has
analyzed specimens that may be associated with H. nasus, which
were collected in the municipality of Volta Redonda, in the
state of Rio de Janeiro, and also in Cachoeiro de
Itapemirim, in the state of Espírito Santo, although further research
is required to confirm the identity of the taxon. Ischnocnema
guentheri is currently considered to be a species complex (Kwet
& Solé 2005, Gehara et al. 2013). Based on mitochondrial
and nuclear sequences, combined with bioacoustic data, Gehara et al.
(2013) identified I. guentheri sensu stricto as a lineage restricted
to the PNT, although it seems likely that this form
is also present in adjacent areas.
