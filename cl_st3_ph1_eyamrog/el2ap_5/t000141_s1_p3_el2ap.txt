FINDINGS: Plans, decrees and technical notes were identified for 18
Brazilian federal units. In most documents, the scientific team was
made up exclusively of technicians (n = 10). The number
of indicators found ranged from 2 to 11, being stratified
into 5 categories: frequency and distribution of the disease; social
and collective adherence; installed capacity or service profile; productive potential;
and availability of supplies.
