In a way, the decision of not returning was deeply
connected to the insertion into the Portuguese kinship networks, as
well as much of the collective life of these Brazilians
had to do with the same networks: girlfriends, employers, customers.
What I want to highlight is that this insertion permanently
modulated the experience of these Brazilians in the city of
Port.
