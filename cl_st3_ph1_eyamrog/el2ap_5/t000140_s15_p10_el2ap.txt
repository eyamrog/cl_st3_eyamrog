A little more than a quarter of the syllabuses, at
27.2 percent (923), assigned readings to the students as part
of their coursework (Table 3a). Paying for the right to
use these readings is what is at issue in the
court case introduced earlier. Among the four different types of
readings used in this analysis, the journal article forms the
largest group. There were 7,961 articles assigned on 707 syllabuses
(20.8% of all syllabuses), with an average of 11.3 articles
assigned on syllabuses with research articles (Table 3b). This represents
a commendable pedagogical effort to engage students in the primary
work of leading scholars in a fifth of the courses
sampled in our study. Scholarly book chapters (4,906) appeared on
just about as many syllabuses, at 702 (20.7%), as journal
articles, though in smaller clusters, with 7.0 scholarly book chapters
on average appearing on the syllabuses with such chapters.
