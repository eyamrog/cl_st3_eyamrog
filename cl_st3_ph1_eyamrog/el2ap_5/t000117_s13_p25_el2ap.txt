The expression that lends the book a title seems to
hark back to Foucault’s book Discipline and Punish (2014), to
which a single reference is made, in the following passage:
“some theoreticians, like Michael Foucault, have identified great similarities between
schooling spaces and prison spaces, madhouses and hospitals, in which
structures and functioning are marked by forms of control and
punishment” (Barros, 2018, p. 29).
