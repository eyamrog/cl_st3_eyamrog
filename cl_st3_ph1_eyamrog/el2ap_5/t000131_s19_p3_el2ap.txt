Intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) of M. glomerata plants grown at
I75 was higher than at I0 (figure 1 g). However,
in M. laevigata plants grew under I75, iWUE showed the
lowest values when compared to other treatments (figure 1 h).
Lower values of iWUE were observed in M. laevigata plants
when compared with M. glomerata plants (supplementary material table S2).
This result might reflect the increased gs observed in M.
laevigata plants (figure 1 h).
