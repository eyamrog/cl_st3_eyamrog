(Decontamination protocol of the macroalga Bostrychia binderi Harvey (Rhodophyta) for
unialgal cultures and laboratory studies). This study aimed to test
the effectiveness of physical and chemical procedures for surface decontamination
of Bostrychia binderi Harvey. For this, thalli were washed and
immersed in chemical solutions (5% liquid detergent, 1% povidone iodine
and 0.2% sodium hypochlorite) at different times and combinations. After
treatments the thalli were cultivated in laboratory to verify possible
negative effects caused by the procedures to alga. Contaminating organisms
in the algal culture medium were quantified at the end
of cultivation. Washing, spraying, removing of macrofauna individuals with tweezers,
thalli immersion in 5% liquid detergent for 60 seconds, after
in 0.2% sodium hypochlorite for 2 minutes were effective procedures
to eliminate all contaminants analyzed. Thalli immersion in 1% povidone
iodine did not affect negatively the thalli growth, whereas immersion
in 0.2% sodium hypochlorite for 5 minutes affected. For establishment
of Bostrychiaâ€™s unialgal cultures we recommend the proposed protocol in
this study.
