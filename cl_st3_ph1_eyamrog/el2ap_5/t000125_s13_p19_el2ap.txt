Next, Fig 4 shows the evolution of the total data
available for Brazilian Institutions in the years 2017-2020. It shows
that we have reached a value of 44.71% in the
years 2019 and 2020, compared to a minimum of 38.48%
in 2018. It means stabilization in this number in the
last two years, with some improvements compared to previous years,
but this value is still not good enough to give
good positions for our Universities.
