The experience of these people from Valadares in Portugal is,
in a sense, a reverse of Brazilian life in Porto:
if the latter were keen to show themselves as Brazilian
to get the opportunity in the labor market that valued
such Brazilianness, the former try to conceal any Brazilianness, as
a way to not jeopardize the original migration plans.
