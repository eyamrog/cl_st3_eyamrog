The first thing to do is to define what I
call ‘the machinery’: I use the term as a metaphor
for the construction of theoretical and analytical models of explanation
(sociological, anthropological etc.). This metaphor helps me to think the
models as a set of machines, gears and devices organizing
a general machinery of thinking. Thus, we need to be
aware and understand that the machines are not things in
themselves: they are tools we use to think about the
events and processes that interest us.
