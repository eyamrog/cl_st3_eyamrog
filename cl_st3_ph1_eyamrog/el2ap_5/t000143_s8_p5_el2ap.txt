In addition, northeastern society, especially that of the state of
Sergipe, culturally preserves provincial habits and traditions in a peculiar
way, whose valorization of families with surnames, titles and economic
possessions is an indelible mark in the history of the
patriarchy present in the Northeast of Brazil 14,15. In this
sense, it is important to highlight that there is evidence
that points to an increase in this type of violence
in places where patriarchal culture is still perpetuated 16, being
justified by the fact that in more conservative communities, gender
norms are more rigid and women remain submissive, strictly fulfilling
and supporting for long periods the roles assigned to them
by the culture 3.
