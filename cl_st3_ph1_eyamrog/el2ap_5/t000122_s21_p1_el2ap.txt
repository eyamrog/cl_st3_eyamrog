Ciliates, microcrustaceans, nematodes, annelids and small gastropods in samples of
thalli culture medium from all treatments and control were quantified
by stereoscopic and optical microscopy. Immersion treatments in 5% liquid
detergent (60 seconds) and after in 1% povidone iodine had
not effectiveness to eliminate contaminants on the thalli surface, and
the mean number of contaminants (individuals mL-1) was not significantly
different among these treatments and control (table 1).
