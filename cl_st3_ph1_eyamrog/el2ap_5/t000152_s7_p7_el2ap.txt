The study draws on data from state institutional sources and
legislative documents, as well as on literature from civil institutions
such as Oxfam, Fundação Getulio Vargas (Getulio Vargas Foundation), Associação
Brasileira de Mantenedoras do Ensino Superior (Brazilian Association of Higher
Education Administrators), as well as census data, legislator files, and
journalistic articles about the pandemic in major national newspapers, news
magazines and websites such as UOL, Estadão, Agência Brasil, Veja.
Guided by the research question, the paper is structured in
two sections: the first, A short history of higher education,
offers an historical overview of Brazilian higher education; the second,
entitled The impact of COVID-19 on higher education in Brazil,
examines the impact of the pandemic on student retention in
Higher Education, looking at factors such as social isolation, job
and income precarity, use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT),
internet access and technological resources. In conclusion, we make policy
recommendations to improve access to higher education.
