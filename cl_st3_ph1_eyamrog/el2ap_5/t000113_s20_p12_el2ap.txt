Throughout history, stereotypes (e g., gender, social or financial status,
race, religion, economic situation) and prejudice influence how society is
stratified and how oppressed groups are formed and defined. In
this sense, the Social Domain-Theory (SDT) (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999),
used in this study, aims to combine the social psychological
theories of intergroup relations and the ideologies and processes of
legitimizing social inequalities (Islam, 2014).
