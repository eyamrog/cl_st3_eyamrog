According to the author, such aims are not new, but
had already made an appearance in last century’s education reform
texts. The school should promote a universal type of reason,
forming the cosmopolitan citizen with a “homeless mind”, taken from
the local context. The individuals should appropriate universal thinking modes
in order to plan their own lives within their communities.
More recently, transformations can be identified in educational discourses, now
in the face of an uncertain future. The present day
“unfinished cosmopolitan” is someone who learns in the course of
life. To the figure of the “lifelong learner” correspond the
figure of the “reflexive teacher”, continually dedicated to reflect on
his or her own practice, in view of obtaining better
results (Popkewitz, 2008).
