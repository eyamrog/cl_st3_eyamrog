In the first case (Machado 2009), a result from my
PhD research carried out almost fifteen years ago, we had
a specific population of Brazilians: a set of immigrants mostly
men, single, young and living around jobs in the sector
of restaurants. They formed a collective of people who knew
each other, visited, related and lived the Portuguese life in
the city of Porto, in 2000. The lives of these
Brazilians were outlined by the Portuguese kinship networks, basically the
lower classes. They produced, thus, a specific reality of life,
marked by the integration into the labor market and by
the inclusion into Portuguese kinship networks. From this Brazilian universe
in Porto, I want to highlight something interesting in this
speech: the relationship they constituted with Brazil. For a number
of factors that are not to be explained here, clearly
allied to the inclusion into Portuguese kinship networks, these immigrants
did not think about, and did not visualized in their
horizons, the return to Brazil. Coming to Brazil was important,
but only as a way to "recharge" something like a
Brazilianness index that had importance in the internal relations of
these Brazilian in the city of Porto.
