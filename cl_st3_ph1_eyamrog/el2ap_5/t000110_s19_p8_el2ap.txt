Staurosirella dubia (Grunow) E.A.Morales & K.M.Manoylov has a similar valve
outline when compared to Staurosirella pinnata (Ehrenberg) D.M.Williams & Round
(1988: 274). However, S. dubia differs by having larger valves,
lanceolate valve outline in the greater specimens, elliptical in the
smaller ones, and wider striae (Morales 2010). It was found
in 56% of the core samples, reaching 6% maximum abundance.
Current species were present in samples from the end of
the Mid-Holocene (~6.000 cal. yr BP) up to the core
top. Current survey is the first report of this species
occurrence in the Brazilian Amazon.
