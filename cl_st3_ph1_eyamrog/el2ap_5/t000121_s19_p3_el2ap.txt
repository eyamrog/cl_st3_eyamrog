Four binomial logistic regressions were performed, one for each of
the PHQ-4 outcomes and another two for the possible combinations
of these outcomes. Table 1 shows the results of each
model, as well as their adjustment indicators, which were all
satisfactory, with high predictive capacity and explained variance. It was
found none multicollinearity issues between the variables in all models.
Regarding the first model, related to anxious symptoms, younger people
(up to 24 years old) showed 1.6 more chances of
having symptoms than those over 39 years old (OR =
.6; 1/OR = 1.5). Individuals who reported not having a
steady income were more likely to have anxious symptoms than
those who had a steady income (OR = 1.4), and
those who perceived themselves as ill also showed more chances
of having symptoms suggestive of anxiety than those who perceived
themselves as healthy (OR = 2.1). The meta-worry variable showed
that those who scored above the mean had a 12-fold
higher chance of having anxious symptoms than those who scored
up to the mean (OR = 12.0).
