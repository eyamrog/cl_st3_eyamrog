There was a predominance of significant spatial groupings of femicide
rates in the central Sergipe region (Fig. 2), which was
confirmed by LISA (Fig. 3). Studies also show the possibility
of some peculiar context in the central region of Sergipe,
despite not having found spatial dependence on the rates of
femicide in the Sergipeâ€™s municipalities in 2017 28, despite the
findings of Grana 29 and Meneghel & Portella 30 suggest
that the incidence of femicide is higher in urban agglomerations
and cities with a higher population density. It is known
that the scenarios of feminicides are diverse and present peculiar
geographical contexts that are associated with the female gender 30.
There is an increase in femicide in places where there
is a predominance of patriarchal culture, an indelible mark of
Sergipe society 14,31,32. This fact could be observed in the
groupings of municipalities in Sergipe that presented spatial autocorrelations of
the "high-high" type. This is because in these agglomerations there
is intense livestock activity, with an appreciation of male gender
roles, in which the courage, strength and virility of men
are considered essential to work with cattle, usually extending to
gender relations and daily life. Similar conditions were found in
other regions of Brazil that also have this economic matrix
and still maintain strong traditional patriarchal values and the submission
of women to men 33.
