When looking at individual performances, we see that SÃ£o Paulo
State University (UNESP) leaded the ranking in 2017 and 2018,
but lost many positions after that. The year 2019 was
marked by an increase in data reported and new Brazilian
Institutions appearing in this ranking, which shows that this ranking
is growing in importance in Brazil. This fact makes the
leadership in the dimensions to be more divided among Institutions,
so increasing the equilibrium among the best Brazilian performers. 2020
confirmed this tendency.
