A structured and standardized script was used for data collection,
created using Microsoft Office ExcelÂ® software version 16.0, and made
available for cloud computing. The collection was preceded by a
training aiming at calibrating the development of the active search.
After the data extraction, a double-check was applied by one
of the authors who had his records checked by a
second author.
