Depending on the context, people who are related to an
abortion in some way experience stigma in various forms. Women
and girls who decide to have an abortion, together with
those who intervene supporting them or healthcare providers and pro-choice
activists, among others, may suffer from it. However, all of
them have the possibility of resisting or reversing such stigma.
