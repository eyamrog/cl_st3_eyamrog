To support this hypothesis, evidence suggests that institutional donors have
a favorable perception of NPO that are well managed (for
example Harris et al., 2015). However, there are also reasons
to expect that governance does not influence donors' decisions. In
general, donors can monitor more directly the organization’s performance through
the project they support (Lacruz et al., 2019), or be
more sensitive toward social status (Bekkers and Wiepking, 2011); therefore,
they will be less prone to use information about NPO
governance for their donation decision. In the Brazilian context, different
from the North American and the European, donors may not
have available information on NPO’s governance, which would make them
consider other elements for decision-making (Lee, 2016).
