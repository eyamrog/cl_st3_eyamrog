These developments introduced a financial conflict into the distribution of
course readings. A 2013 study, conducted by one of the
authors of this paper, for example, determined that 45.1 percent
of the readings purchased by students in 110 Stanford University
and Queen’s University course-packs had been freely available to them
from their respective libraries and through open access (Evans and
Willinsky, 2013). In 2017, a study of 12 University of
Toronto course pointed to the “double-charging” of students as “55
percent of the assigned readings were already licensed by the
library and were fully available in electronic form” (Cancilla, Glushko,
Orfano & Slaght, 2017). The students are paying a royalty
fee for course readings that the library had already purchased
a campus-wide license for with the student’s tuition fees. Our
study provides a further, large-scale update on this issue, involving
3,391 Canadian university syllabuses from 34 institutions, demonstrating the extent
of the double-charging, which may apply to over 90 percent
of the assigned readings. By distinguishing between academic and trade
publications, the study proposes a fair resolution for all parties
through a “three-step syllabus rule.” In this regard, the study
also intends to inform current lawsuits in Canada and the
United States concerned with universities’ handling of course readings.
