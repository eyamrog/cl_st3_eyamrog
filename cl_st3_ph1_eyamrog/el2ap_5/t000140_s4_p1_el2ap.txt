This analysis of Canadian university syllabuses reveals the proportion of
assigned readings that fall into different publication types, with those
from academic sources dominating the syllabuses. While the analysis of
the syllabuses does not, by any means, dictate the policy
terms of a fair and reasonable strategy for compensating the
producers of the materials used in these courses, the analysis
does provide a means of assessing a policyâ€™s outcomes, which
is what we have done here with our proposed three-step
syllabus rule. The rule would eliminate the double-charging of students
for materials already available to them, in the first instance,
while recognizing the differences in economies between scholarly and trade
publishing in the university context. The preponderance of scholarly readings
assigned in these courses adds weight to the making of
this distinction in arriving at what is fair for students,
authors, and publishers.
