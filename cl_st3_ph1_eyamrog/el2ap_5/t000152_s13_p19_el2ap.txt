Due to Ordinance 2117/2019 (Federative Republic of Brazil 2019) which
allows for the provision of up to 40% of the
theoretical course load using digital platforms, in many private HEIs
the use of ICT for distance learning is already a
reality. This has facilitated continuity of courses. However, in public
HEIs application of the ordinance is uneven, and reflects resistance
to distance education. Barone (2020) reported about platforms made available
by the Ministry of Education that are not used in
higher education, reiterated the resistance to the use of technology
in teacher training and the difficulty in adopting a new
way of teaching. The academic year in public universities in
2020 was greatly disrupted as students are more affected by
social inequalities, geographic remoteness and access to ICT.
