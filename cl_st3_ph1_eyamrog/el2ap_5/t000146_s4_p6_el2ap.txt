There is a need to recognize and reward the scientific
output of research communities which are of local or regional
interest, and make it possible to strike a better balance
between publications in English. The existence of regional citation indexes
in broader platforms such as the Web of Science, makes
it possible to give this knowledge greater visibility and inclusion
in the global flow of scientific information, as well as
to ensure "linguistic accessibility" to local or regional communities.
