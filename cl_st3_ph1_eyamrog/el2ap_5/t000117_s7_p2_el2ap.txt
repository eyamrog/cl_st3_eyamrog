Beyond this piece of news, floating about on the discursive
surface6 of the internet, the idea that the future implies
in demands where the ICTs will transform teaching and learning
seems not to be the dominant agenda only in media
articles. As we penetrate discursive exteriority, we notice that such
notion is not recent, having been put forward at other
moments as an alternative to conventional education: an education of
the future grounded on continuous and Whole Life Learning by
means of the use of technological devices and diverse spatialities.
Dubbed learning society, (Noguera-Ram√≠rez, 2009), this paradigm has constituted the
agenda of international organizations such as the United Nations Education,
Science and Culture Organization (UNESCO), informing, above all, the formulation
and implementation of public policies in different nation-states.
