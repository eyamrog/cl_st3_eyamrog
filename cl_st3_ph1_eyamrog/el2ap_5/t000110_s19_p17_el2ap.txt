Based on the valve outline, Gomphonema acuminatum C.G.Ehrenberg is extremely
similar to Gomphonema brebissonii F.T.KÃ¼tzing (1849: 66) and Gomphonema coronatum
C.G.Ehrenberg (1841: 211). However, G. brebissoni has a well reduced
apical inflation, and G. coronatum a smaller inflation near the
headpole (Kociolek 2011). Occurrence of G. acuminatum was rare, since
it is found in only 2% of the core samples,
reaching 1% maximum abundance. The species is found in samples
from the Late Holocene up to the core top (~1.757
cal. yr BP to the present day). Present research is
the first report of this species occurrence in the Brazilian
Amazon.
