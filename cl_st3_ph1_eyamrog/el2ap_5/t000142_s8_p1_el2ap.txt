Femicide is the result of a violent interaction that involves
the death of a woman or a girl and the
extreme and direct form of an interpersonal process. Researchers have
suggested that femicide should be considered a specific case of
violent phenomena, which can be interpreted in a comprehensive and
theoretical framework. Femicide was first used as a concept in
1801, referring to "the murder of a woman"1. It was
legally recognized in 1848 and published in the Wharton Legal
Dictionary, thereby appearing in the English legal terminology. Radford (1992)2
made a special emphasis by saying, "You cannot mobilize against
something with no name." The fact that the violent deaths
of individuals belonging to gender have reached non-negligible systematic dimensions
has drawn all disciplines' attention. Hence, studies have been initiated
to establish a conceptual framework. The word femicide was introduced
to the literature when Diana Russel first used it at
the International Tribunal for Crimes Against Women in March 1976.
Later, femicide was defined by Radford & Russell (1992)3 as
"the misogynistic killing of women by men." In addition to
this, Radford emphasized that a femicide is a form of
sexual violence. The word Homicide, which refers to the murder
of a human being, has been restricted with the word
femicide4, a theoretical concept referring to the murder of a
woman5. Due to the increasing number of cases, this phenomenon
has started to be included in other languages. It has
been referred to as feminicide in Spanish and kadÄ±n cinayetleri
in Turkish. In 1985, the term gendercide emerged to express
the deliberate extermination of individuals of a particular gender6.
