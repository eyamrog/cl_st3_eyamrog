In Japan, we have indications of kinship blending what was
separated in Brazil. Thus, we see two distinct forms of
kinship organizations, having the migration itself as the engine of
change. New ways of life in Japan produced new forms
of kinship. Therefore, a family of Okinawan parentage in Brazil
is not the same as it is in Japan today.
Migration produced distinguished kinship systems, which now radically affect the
lives of both the people who have gone to Japan,
and those who stayed, as Kubota states: those who stay
begin to reorganize their set of relations based more on
the neighborhood that on the blood. Members of families emptied
by emigration tend to join and form new families. We
are, therefore, talking about a third kinship system that seems
to still retain something of the division between Okinawans and
Japanese.
