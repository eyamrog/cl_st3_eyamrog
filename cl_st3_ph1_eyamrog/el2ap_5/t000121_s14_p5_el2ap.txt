To identify the existence of symptoms of anxiety and /
or depression, we used the 4-item version of the Patient
Health Questionnaire [PHQ-4], Portuguese version, developed by Kroenke, Spitzer, Williams,
and Löwe (2009). In the initial study, the instrument showed
good internal consistency (α = 0.75). The PHQ-4 is a
ultra-short screening questionnaire that assesses the frequency of symptoms of
anxiety and / or depression over the preceding two weeks,
with responses scored on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from
“never” (1) to “almost every day” (4). The total score
is obtained by the separate sum of the responses of
the items referring to the symptoms of anxiety (“feeling nervous,
anxious or very tense” and “not being able to prevent
or control worries”) and depression (“feeling down, depressed, or without
perspective” and “little interest or little pleasure in doing things”),
where a score of three indicates significant signs of anxiety
and / or depression disorders. In the current study, we
applied a cutoff at score three because this survey just
aimed screening significant symptomatology of anxiety or depressive disorders. The
PHQ-4 had satisfactory reliability in this research (α = 0.84).
