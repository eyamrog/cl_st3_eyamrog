At the end of the cultivation, 30 mL of culture
medium from each replicate were discarded, and 20 mL of
formaldehyde were added, the final formaldehyde concentration was of 4%.
Rose Bengal dye was also added. 4% Formaldehyde was utilized
to fix and preserve the contaminants and Rose Bengal dye
to color them facilitating afterward the visual counting. A volume
of culture medium (1 mL) from all replicates was taken
away near to thalli surface by pipetting and deposited into
SedgEwick-Rafter counting chamber so that the contaminants could be counted
under stereoscopic and optical microscopy.
