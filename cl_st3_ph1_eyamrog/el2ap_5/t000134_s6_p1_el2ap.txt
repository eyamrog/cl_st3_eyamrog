The results of the present study indicate that the forests
of the PNT harbor for a large proportion of the
herpetofaunal diversity of the Atlantic Forest of the state of
Rio de Janeiro. Considering both the records obtained during our
fieldwork and from secondary data, the park’s amphibian species richness
would amount to at least 38 species, which represent 19%
of the amphibians known to occur in the state (N
= 201 species; Dorigo et al. 2018), 6% of the
amphibian species from Atlantic Rainforest (N = 600; Rossa-Feres et
al. 2017), and 3% of the amphibian fauna of Brazil
(N = 1,136; Segalla et al. 2019). The combination of
primary and secondary data also indicates the occurrence of 36
reptile species in the PNT, which represent 24% of the
reptiles known to occur in the whole Rio de Janeiro
state (N = 149; Oliveira et al. 2020), 12% of
the species recorded in the Atlantic Rainforest (N = 300;
Tozetti et al. 2017), and 4% of the country’s reptilian
diversity (N = 795 species; Costa & Bérnils 2018). When
considering the sampled area and the effort employed, the number
of amphibian and reptile species recorded during surveys in PNT
is consistent with the expected. In fact, the cumulative species
curves for both groups reached the asymptote by around the
middle of the study period, indicating that sampling effort was
adequate in both cases. Similarly, while the confidence intervals of
the rarefaction curves for the amphibians converged to zero, indicating
sampling sufficiency, those calculated for the reptiles approached the convergence,
with reduced estimated error.
