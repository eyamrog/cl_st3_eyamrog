(Morpho-physiological performance of Mikania glomerata Spreng. and Mikania laevigata Sch.
Bip ex Baker plants under different light conditions). In tropical
and subtropical zones, lianas play important roles in the process
of ecological succession. This study aims to evaluate the photosynthetic
and morpho-physiological performance between two lianas species from Mikania genus
in response to different levels of radiation: full sun (I0),
25% (I25), 50% (I50), and 75% (I75) retention of solar
radiation flux. Plants grown under I75 showed a reduced net
photosynthetic rate (A). We observed dynamic photoinhibition at I0 during
hours of high irradiation and temperature. The highest and lowest
leaf chlorophyll content occurred at I75 and I0, respectively, while
carotenoids/total chlorophyll and leaf thickness increased under I0. Total dry
mass was higher in plants grown at I0 and I25.
However, A values and biomass production of Mikania laevigata were
higher at I25, while for Mikania glomerata greater biomass accumulation
was observed between I0-I50. Therefore, we concluded that M. laevigata
and M. glomerata have different morpho-physiological performances under same the
radiation conditions.
