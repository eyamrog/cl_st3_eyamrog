We performed the tests according to the manufacturer´s instructions, using
the MDX Instrument from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) for RNA extraction
and Applied Biosystem MDX thermocycler instrument, from Thermo-Fisher (Waltham, USA).
Specificity Estimates: For estimating the MedTest specificity, we tested 100
plasma samples from Hemorio´s blood donor repository, collected in the
year 2018, long before the new Coronavirus pandemic. All the
donors tested negative for infectious disease markers required for blood
donation. We also tested 20 donor samples from 2018; those
samples were all positive for one marker of infection (anti-HIV,
anti-HCV, HBsAg).
