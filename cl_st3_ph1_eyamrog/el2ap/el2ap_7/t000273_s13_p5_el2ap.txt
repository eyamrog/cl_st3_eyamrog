There are reasons to believe that enhancing PHC in this
pandemic moment can be a potent alternative. The Family Health
Strategy (ESF), initially created as the Family Health Program (PSF)
in the early 1990s, has been the main instrument for
reorienting Brazilian healthcare practice and consolidating PHC in Brazil.6 In
1998, Brazil had 2,054 family health teams; in 2017, there
were already 41,619, covering 70% of the Brazilian population (about
143 million people).7 The Mais MÃ©dicos (More Doctors) Program was
responsible for an accelerated growth in family health coverage between
2014 and 2017, whose coverage went from 66.9% to 70.0%.
The PHC workforce involved more than 36,000 health posts, 63,000
doctors, 70,000 nurses, 263,000 community health workers and 26,000 oral
health teams.8
