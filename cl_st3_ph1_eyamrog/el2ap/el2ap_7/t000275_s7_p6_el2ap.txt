In this article we present a simple and reproducible technique
to be performed, using common materials, which can be adopted
for the surgical patient during the pandemic of COVID-19, while
undergoing laparoscopic or robotic procedures. In the current pandemic scenario,
more reliable evidence on the effectiveness of the virus transmission
and its reduction as well as the results of the
various initiatives are lacking. Nonetheless, a series of recommendations can
be shared aiming at reducing the possible spreading of the
virus7,8. The current described adaptation specifically aims to minimize the
dispersion of aerosols while performing surgical interventions in order to
preserve the healthcare professionals.
