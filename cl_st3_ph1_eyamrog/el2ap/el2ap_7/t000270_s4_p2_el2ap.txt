Survey of the PEFI freshwater algae is practically completed. It
includes over 50 years of random samplings accomplished in the
PEFI water bodies. The collection was made in nine reservoirs
(Garças, Ninfeias, IAG, Cisnes, Bambus I, Bambus II, Bugios, Monjolo
and Girinos) locally called “lakes”, the hydrophytoterium (a place for
exhibition of aquatic plants in the São Paulo Botanical Gardens),
and a creek (Pirarungáua Creek). All those places were visited
randomly more than once and some of them (Garças, Ninfeias,
and IAG) during successive months in the case of ecology
projects. About 1,000 sample units were gathered during the 57
years duration of present inventory. It is still missing, however,
the survey of the Radiococcaceae (Chlorophyceae), and from the Bacillariophyta
are already ready the Coscinodiscophyceae and from the Bacillariophyceae, the
Eunotiaceae, Pinnulariaceae, Cymbellales, Surirellales, and Rhopalodiales. Consequently, all other diatom
groups are until now missing.
