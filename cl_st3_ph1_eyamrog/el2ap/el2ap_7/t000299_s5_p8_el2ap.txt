Another strategy for pacifier decontamination widely used by childrenâ€™s parents
is the vigorous cleaning method using only sterile water. However,
it has been shown to be insufficient to eliminate total
contamination of a pacifier [8,10] nor contamination by planktonic cells
[3,9,11], which confirms that only water is not effective in
eliminating contamination by bacteria and fungi [4,7]. These results indicate
that water can be used as a control in vitro
tests in order to evaluate the effectiveness of different disinfection
protocols (physical and chemical) prior to in vivo evaluations [3].
