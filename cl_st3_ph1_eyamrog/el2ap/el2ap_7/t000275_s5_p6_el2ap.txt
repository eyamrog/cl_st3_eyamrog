The questionable effectiveness and potential limitations of the reported method
aiming at the reduction of aerosol dispersion should be acknowledged.
Nonetheless, studies with better levels of evidence are lacking. We
believe that in the current COVID-19 pandemic scenario when uncertainties
and lack of good quality information are a reality, the
spreading of preliminary data or techniques may be helpful, without
acknowledging the need for future studies to be carried out.
