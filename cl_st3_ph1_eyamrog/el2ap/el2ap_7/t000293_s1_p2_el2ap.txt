Materials and Methods: This retrospective single-center study selected 91 patients
who had chest CT and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
test collected at the same day. CT results were classified
in negative, typical, indeterminate or atypical findings. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity
and specificity were calculated for two different scenarios: in the
first, only typical find- ings on CT were considered positive;
in the second, both typical and indeterminate findings were considered
positive.
