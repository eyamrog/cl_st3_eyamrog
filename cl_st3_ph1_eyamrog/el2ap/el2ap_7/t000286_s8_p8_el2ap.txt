There is no doubt that FDI is one of the
tools available that can contribute to the promotion of economic
development efforts. Therefore, countries seek to create an environment that
enables investment in order to increase inflows. Turkey, which is
a developing country, has designed policies to attract qualified investment
with the aim of improving the efficiency of the economy
since 2006. Moreover, it is also widely acknowledged that developing
countries often face shortages of capital inflows.
