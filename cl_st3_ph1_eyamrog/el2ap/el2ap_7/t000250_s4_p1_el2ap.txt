People engaged in higher levels of MVPA and VPA are
less likely to present depressive, anxiety, and D&A symptoms during
self-isolation. Those reporting higher levels of SB are more likely
to present prevalent depressive symptoms. Strategies targeting to increase MVPA
and VPA and reduce SB at populational levels might be
important to mitigate the mental health burden during the COVID-19
pandemics. Public health recommendations should make clear to the general
population how to exercise safely.
