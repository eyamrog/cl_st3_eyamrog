Several studies have demonstrated the imaging as- pects of this
disease, with an emphasis on high-resolution computed tomography (CT) of
the chest(3â€“18). This method is not yet routinely recommended for
screening or initial diagnosis of COVID-19, but it can be
useful in assessing the severity of the disease, response to
treatment, pres- ence of complications and differential diagnoses(19). Few studies
have evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of chest CT in screening
patients with suspected COVID-19(11,17,18). This analysis is important due to
the presence of other en- demic and seasonal viruses, especially
in scenarios where there is little availability of the serological
test (PCR) or delay in providing the results.
