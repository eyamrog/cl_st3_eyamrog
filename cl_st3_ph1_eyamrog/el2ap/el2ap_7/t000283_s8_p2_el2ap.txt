Fatality rate has varied substantially among countries and possible explanations
are the accuracy of the tests and the difference between
strategies used for SARS-CoV-2 testing. For example, in countries like
Brazil, test availability is currently limited, and tests are prioritized
for patients with more severe clinical symptoms who are suspected
of having COVID-19 (2). On the other hand, countries such
as the Republic of Korea have adopted a strategy of
widely testing for SARS-CoV-2. As many patients with mild symptoms
(which accounts for nearly 80% of SARS-CoV-2 infections) who would
not be tested in Brazil were probably identified and included
in the denominator in Korea, a much lower case- fatality
rate (1%) compared with Brazil (6.1%) is expected (3), and
the actual overall mortality rate may be closer to Korea
than Brazil estimations.
