As opposed to the key differences observed across the 70
orthologues in mammals, no relevant polymorphism was identified in these
30 ACE2 binding sites considering human populations. In that sense,
Homo sapiens is a “homogeneous” primate species, at least in
regards to the 30 ACE2 important binding sites. In addition
to that, Homo sapiens has a large population (census size
of ~7.5 billion individuals) currently living in virtually all habitable
places on Earth, including regions with very high demographic density.
Based on these observations, we can suggest that the high
and efficient tropism is extended to all human populations, in
addition to demographic and cultural conditions linked to particular human
populations that may facilitate contagion and dispersion of this opportunistic
coronavirus.
