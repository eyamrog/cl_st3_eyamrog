With all the concern focused on the hospital network, one
component of the system has been overlooked: Primary Health Care
(PHC). In the plan to combat COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil,
there is no explicit and/or clearly mention of investment and/or
strengthening of this component of the health system.4 We advocate
that failing to appreciate the importance of PHC in this
pandemic moment can be a mistake in favor of the
rapid collapse of the health system in the face of
the increase in cases of COVID-19 in the country.
