From the data generated from the linearity curve of each
sample, it was possible to determine the appropriate concentration of
each extract that would cause hemolysis of red blood cells
by 50% (IC50). These data were used to determine the
selectivity index (SI) of each extract for the bacteria tested,
and enabled the calculation according to the methodology proposed by
Protopopova et al. (2005) using the equation: SI = IC50
MIC , where: SI = Selectivity Index IC50 = concentration
of each extract that would cause hemolysis of red blood
cells by 50% MIC = Minimum Inhibitory Concentration against the
test microorganism
