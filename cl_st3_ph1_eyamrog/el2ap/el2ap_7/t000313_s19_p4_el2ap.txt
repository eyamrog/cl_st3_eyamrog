Position 24, which is one of the three sites with
high probability of being under positive selection, has eight different
amino acids segregating across taxon (Figures 2 and S1). Li
et al. (2005b) showed that the amino acid change from
Glutamine to Lysine at position 24 (Q24K), together with a
change from Lysine to Glutamate at position 26 (K26E), slightly
inhibits interactions with SARS-CoV S glycoprotein (Li et al., 2005b).
Rattus norvegicus has this combination (24K and 26E), while mouse
species (Mus musculus, Mus caroli, and Mus pahari) have an
Asparagine (N) at the position 24. Rattus norvegicus ACE2 also
has the combination of Asparagine (N), Phenylalanine (F), and Serine
(S) at positions 82-84. According to Li et al. (2005b),
this combination in rats (R. norvegicus) inhibits the interaction between
ACE2 and SARS- CoV S glycoprotein. In addition, a Histidine
(H) at positions 353 of ACE2 in the murine species
also could inhibit or reduce the efficiency of the interaction
according to Wan et al. (2020). Our study shows that
murine speciesâ€™ ACE2 have only 56% of identity with the
human ACE2 regarding these 30 binding sites. This reinforces the
idea that they cannot naturally bind to S glycoprotein of
SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, Glutamine (Q) and Lysine (K)
at 24 and 26 ACE2 positions are found in humans
and all primates, as well as in Cavia porcellus (Guinea-pig),
a rodent used very often as an experimental animal. However,
there are differences in other important binding sites, resulting in
the identity between Guinea-pig ACE2 and the human ACE2, regarding
these 30 binding sites, being just 70%.
