For performing procedures in patients with suspected or confirmed infection
with the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which can generate aerosols (such
as procedures that induce cough, intubation or tracheal aspiration, invasive
and non-invasive ventilation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, manual ventilation before intubation, sputum
induction, nasotracheal sample collections), healthcare professionals must use respiratory protection
masks (particulate respirator), with minimum efficiency in the filtration of
95% of particles up to 0.3 Âµ (type N95, N99,
N100, PFF2 or PFF3).8,23 Procedures that can generate aerosols should
preferably be performed in a respiratory isolation unit with negative
pressure and a Hepa filter (high efficiency particulate arrestance). In
the absence of this type of unit, patients should be
placed in a room with closed doors (and open windows)
and restrict the number of professionals during these procedures.23
