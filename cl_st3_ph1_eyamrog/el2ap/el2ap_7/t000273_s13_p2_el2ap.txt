To prevent or at least delay the collapse of the
health system - already observed in other countries - a
set of measures were adopted by the Brazilian government. Brazil
hired more than 200 beds of intensive care units (ICU)
and more than 5,800 doctors for the Mais Médicos (More
Doctors) Program in Brazil”, especially to work in large urban
centers where high population density is observed. The government granted
US$ 2 billion for private plans to invest in infrastructure,
acquisition, and distribution of 10 million rapid tests for SARS-CoV-2
infection in the states and municipalities. Additionally, US$ 200 million
were destinated for the acquisition of respirators, US$ 10 million
for scientific studies and transferred US$ 0.9 billion from the
Insurance for Traffic Accidents fund to SUS (4). Despite such
measures, the health system has failed to guarantee comprehensive assistance
to citizens and the risk of collapse has become increasingly
evident and predictable.
