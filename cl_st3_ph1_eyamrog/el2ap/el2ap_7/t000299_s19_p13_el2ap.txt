Among the seven studies included, five had a low risk
of bias [3,8,9,11,13] and two had a medium risk [10,15]
(Figure 2). Three studies did not use sterile water as
a control material, all of which used more than one
disinfection method in the tests. Only one study showed no
bias under analysis [8].
