On the other hand, results showed a decrease in the
number of individuals (lambda < 1) of the shrub- tree
synusia (95% CI = 0.993 + 0.005) and climbers (95%
CI = 0.951 + 0.003) with > 2.5 cm dbh
(table 1). Similarly, all early-successional plants showed a decrease in
the number of individuals (lambda < 1, 95% CI =
0.982 + 0.015, table 1).
