Despite the existence of other exotic species in fragments of
the park (SMA 2008, Petri et al. 2018), just Coffea
arabica L. (coffee) was present in the sampling units (recruited
in 2012, table 2). The presence of this species is
related to the history of the park area, it was
previously grown in small farms located where the park now
stands (SMA 2008). This species is dispersed by animals and
develops in shaded areas, such as the understory studied (Instituto
HÃ³rus 2019). Currently, the species is classified as Non- Dominant
Invader in the study area (Petri et al. 2018) and
presents intermediate priority for extirpation from protected areas (Durigan et
al. 2013). Therefore, the permanent monitoring of the park fragments
will contribute to the correct management of this species.
