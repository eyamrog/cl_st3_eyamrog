On the opposite side of social isolation, health professionals are
at the forefront of the battle against COVID-19, with greater
risks of infection. Personal protective equipment must be prioritized, and
must be associated with procedures adapted to offer adequate care,
including surgery, in order to reduce the risks of infection.
Procedures with exposure to the patientâ€™s aerosols, such as cricothyroidotomy
and tracheostomy, must be adapted, and require the appropriate education
of emergency physicians and surgeons. Health professionals are the most
valuable resources at the moment.
