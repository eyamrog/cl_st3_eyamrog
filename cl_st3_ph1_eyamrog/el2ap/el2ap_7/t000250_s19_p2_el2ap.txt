9.00 (IQR=10.00), mean=9.98 (7.60), points in the BDI scale. Those
that reported ≥30 minutes in MVPA per day reported lower
depressive symptoms than those that spent <30 minutes per day
in MVPA (AMD= -0.707; 95%CI= -1.160 to -0.253, p=0.002). Also,
those that spent <10 hours in SB per day reported
lower depressive symptoms than those that spent ≥10 hours in
SB per day (AMD= -1.736, 95%CI= -2.704 to -0.768, p<0.001).
