Despite this necessity, there are few studies on the seroprevalence
of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic populations. A major relevant study about
SARS-COV-2 in asymptomatic people is the report from the Diamond
Prince cruise ship. After an outbreak during the cruise, Japanese
health authorities tested 3,063 passengers by RT- PCR and estimated
at 17.9% the asymptomatic proportion among all infected cases [13].
A study in the county of Santa Clara, California, USA,
found a 2.8% seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2, after adjusting for sensitivity
and specificity of the test and population demographics [14].
