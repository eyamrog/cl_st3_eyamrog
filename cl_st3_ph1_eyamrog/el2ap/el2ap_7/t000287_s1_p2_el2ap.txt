At Centro de Terapia Oncológica (CTO), an Oncology clinic in
Petrópolis, RJ — Brazil, all HCWs were screened for SARS-CoV-2
in order to isolate those who were asymptomatic/symptomatic and positive
for the virus. They were all tested through IgM/IgG rapid
testing and those who had symptoms were also tested with
nasopharyngeal swabs for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests
besides IgM/IgG reactivity.
