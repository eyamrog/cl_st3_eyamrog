From a social point of view, disinfection methods should be
effective, simple, inexpensive [3], non- toxic and especially easily implemented
[13]. Despite these diverse and distinct categories that a disinfection
method should present, there are limited studies worldwide committed to
finding the ideal method [11]. Our results corroborate this reality
and go further. While just a simple criterion (types of
pacifier disinfection) was required, not without considering its applicability or
effectiveness, only eight studies were eligible in a long period
of twenty years of use. Nevertheless, the articles obtained, only
Brazil and South Africa seem to be concerned with the
disinfection of pacifiers. We are disregarding the only article from
India included in the study, because when evaluating all the
articles in full, we realized that its content was the
same as a work, also included here, produced in another
region and previously published. Taking advantage of this fact, it
is important to reinforce the relevance of conducting systematic reviews
to critically evaluate the content of published articles, to verify
the pertinence and synthesis of the findings, as already claimed
by other authors [19].
