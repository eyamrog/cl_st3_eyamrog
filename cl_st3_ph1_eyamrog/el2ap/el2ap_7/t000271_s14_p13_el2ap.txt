Our estimation of the population prevalence of COVID-19 proceeded in
three steps. We first reported the crude proportion of positive
tests without any adjustment. Second, we estimated the weighted prevalence
using the 2020 Rio de Janeiro State population. This adjustment
is necessary to balance our sample according to the state
population distribution of sex and age. Third, we adjusted the
prevalence for test sensitivity and specificity using the manufacturerâ€™s estimates
of 85% and 99%, respectively. The true or adjusted prevalence
and its 95% confidence interval were estimated using a previously
published approach [19].
