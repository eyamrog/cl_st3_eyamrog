The coronavirus infection reaches humans through mucous membranes. It is
intuitive that the host's response, whether related to form or
intensity, brings out its clinical expression and after the passage
through the mucosa, a mechanical barrier, the so-called innate immunity
composed by macrophages, lymphocytes (CD4+) and natural killers, must be
able to eliminate the virus and/or present antigens to antibody-producing
cells, humoral immunity, so that infection is banned and permanent
protection is created5. The loss of this battle or an
exacerbated reaction of the immune system itself can lead to
death.
