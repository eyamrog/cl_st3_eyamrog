The acceleration of eutrophication occurred at the end of 1999
with the process of self-eutrophication (internal P loading). This period
represents the beginning of our time series and includes more
than 15 years of post-disturbance data, which provided us with
an excellent opportunity to investigate the system response after such
extreme event (Turner et al. 2006, Muller et al. 2010),
as well as a long-term baseline which allowed to detect
change and measure ecosystem responses to disturbance (Buma 2015).
