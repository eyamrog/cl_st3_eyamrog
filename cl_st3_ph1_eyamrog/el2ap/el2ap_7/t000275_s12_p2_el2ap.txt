Materials: Before starting the procedure, be sure to have two
conventional plastic suction or irrigation cables, a water seal device
and a sterile transparent plastic bag used for the laparoscopic
optic coverage. Certify that the nurse assistant prepares a 2
or 2.5% hypochlorous acid (HClO) solution, diluted in water in
a proportion of 25 mL of hypochlorous acid into 975
mL of water, totalizing a 1000mL solution, since this has
recently been reported to kill the virus10. Another possible chemical
solution is chlorine dioxide stabilized at 7%, diluting 5mL of
the product into 1000mL of water11. These solutions are to
fill the water seal reservoir in order to submerge the
end tip of the plastic cannula (Figure 1). Finally, close
the reservoir with the appropriate cover and connect the first
suction cable to the water seal into orifice A, as
shown in the following figure (Figure 2A).
