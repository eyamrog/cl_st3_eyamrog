Previous studies have demonstrated that clinically active IBD and exposure
to thiopurines increase the risk of viral infections (16,17). However,
unlike other viruses (Influenza, Herpes, Cytomegalovirus, Adenovirus, Rhinovirus, Noro- virus,
and Respiratory Syncytial Virus), coronaviruses have not been shown to
cause more severe disease in immuno- suppressed patients (13,15,17).
