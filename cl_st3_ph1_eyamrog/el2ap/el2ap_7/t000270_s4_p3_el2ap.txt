Nine hundred and eighty-six samples were already collected for the
present survey. Ninfeias Lake was the PEFI most visited place,
with 327 samples. Follow the Garças Lake with 177 samples,
the hydrophytoterium with 157, and the IAG Lake with 152
samples collected. Ninfeias Lake also is the system that encompassed
the largest number of taxa identified, followed by Garças Lake.
The hydrophytoterium comes in the third place, but it is
a very much handled system, to the point that we
do not know anymore its real floristic composition.
