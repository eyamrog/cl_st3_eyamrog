The annual mortality of plants with < 2.5 cm dbh
did not differ from that of plants with > 2.5
cm dbh in the shrub-tree synusia (Mann-Whitney Test, U =
31.5, p = 0.171) and in the climbers synusia (Mann-Whitney
Test, U = 41.5, p = 0.538). However, the annual
plant recruitment in the smallest class (< 2.5 cm dbh)
was greater than that of plants with > 2.5 cm
dbh both in the shrub-trees synusia (Mann-Whitney Test, U =
0, p = 0.00001) and in the climbers synusia (Mann-Whitney
Test, U = 8, p = 0.0006, figure 3).
