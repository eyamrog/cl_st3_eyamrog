The results indicated that the virus can remain viable and
infectious on surfaces from hours to days (depending on the
inoculum), reinforcing the importance of hand hygiene after contact with
inanimate environments and surfaces. This is most likely because the
droplets of viruses that cause respiratory infections are expelled by
coughing and sneezing, and a single droplet can easily contain
an infectious dose.
