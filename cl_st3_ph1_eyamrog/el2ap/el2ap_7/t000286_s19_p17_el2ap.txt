The results revealed that INF does not granger causes GD;
the null hypothesis is accepted at 5% significance level, indicated
by the high probability value 0.7060. The results also revealed
that GD does not granger causes INF, the null hypothesis
is accepted at 5% percent indicated by the probability value
0.7405 and this is confirmed by the F-statistics value 0.3051.
This result therefore indicates no causation flowing from INF to
GD. The results revealed that INT does not granger causes
GD; the null hypothesis is accepted at 5% significance level,
indicated by the high probability value 0.5712.
