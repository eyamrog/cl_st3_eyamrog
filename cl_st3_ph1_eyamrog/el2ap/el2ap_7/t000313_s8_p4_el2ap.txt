ACE2 is a cell-surface non-raft protein with little intracellular localization,
when binding to coronaviruses, the protein internalizes down-regulating activity from
the cell surface (Hamming et al., 2007). After SARS-CoV-like viruses
and ACE2 attach, molecular cascade signal events result in entry
of the coronavirus into the host cell (Simmons et al.,
2013), showing a successful evolutionary infection strategy. Kuba et al.
(2005) showed that ACE2 down regulation mediated by SARS-CoV contributes
to the acute lung injury, the most important clinical implication
of human respiratory diseases caused by a coronavirus.
