In summary, a string or interval lc is defined. It
considers the new sequences that are generated 𝑙𝑐−1 when a
shift is made, one nucleotide at a time. Each ordered
pair is part of the set 𝐵× 𝐵, where 𝐵=
{𝐴, 𝐺, 𝑇, 𝐶}. This procedure is repeated considering the
original sequence together with the one generated by reversing its
order.
