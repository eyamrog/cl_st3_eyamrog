Procedures - Data was collected from 10 transects measuring 2
× 50 m (0,1 ha) laid out in the first
half of 2006 (Davison 2009). The permanent transects were randomly
distributed along a perpendicular 200 m line, totaling a sample
universe of 1 ha, in a conserved area on Botanical
Institute, in a recovery process of past disturbances, however, that
has not been occupied, nor the use thereof been changed,
for at least 65 years (Peccinini & Pivello 2002). The
area is located at an average altitude of 831 m,
on Oxisol soil, and more than 100 m away from
Cursino Avenue (District of Água Funda - São Paulo -
SP). In each transect, shrubs, trees, vines, palms, tree ferns
individuals with a stem diameter at breast height (dbh), i.e.
1.30 m from the soil, of at least > 2.5
cm were measured and identified, the same for the growing
roots of hemiepiphytes at ≤ 1.30 m from the soil
(Gentry’s protocol 1982, Phillips & Miller 2002). In 10 subtransects
(1 × 50 m), all plants with < 2.5 cm
dbh and > 1 m height (h) were sampled (figure
