In 2011, TSI first dropped to the supereutrophic state (figures
2c, 5a) as a consequence of the previous actions and
the temporary diversion of the sewage effluent from the SÃ£o
Paulo State Department of Agriculture (table 3). The exceptional increase
in TSI in 2013 was a response to the historical
drought during the period 2013-2014 in southeastern Brazil (ANA 2015).
In 2014, the sewage effluent was finally inactivated; the system
sustained the supereutrophic state and all variables revealed an improvement
of the system health (table 1).
