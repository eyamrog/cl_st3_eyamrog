In the United Kingdom, the National Health Service (NHS) is
working with dental practices and community dental services to establish
Local Dental Urgent Care System in every region. These dental
offices will accommodate visits of all types of patients, including
those with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, patients that are shielded,
vulnerable or patients without any of those specific conditions. In
those places dental public health practitioners will be available and
will have access to the FFP3 respirator to perform the
treatment.67
