This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first
study assessing the association between MVPA, VPA, MPA, and SB
and prevalent depressive, anxiety, and co-occurring D&A symptoms among self-isolating
adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the present study, nearly
half of participants reported performing ≥30 minutes MVPA per day,
and one third reported spending ≥10 hours in SB per
day. The prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms was approximately
40%, while one third reported co-occurring D&A and anxiety symptoms.
We observed a relationship suggesting that people reporting ≥30 minutes
in MVPA per day were approximately 30% less likely to
present depressive, anxiety, and D&A symptoms, even when we adjust
for relevant covariates. Those reporting ≥15 minutes of VPA per
day were approximately 40% less likely to present with prevalent
depressive and D&A symptoms, and 30% less likely to present
prevalent anxiety symptoms. Those spending ≥10 hours a day in
SB were 39% more likely to present prevalent depressive symptoms
in the adjusted models.
