Urban reservoirs are, in particular, very vulnerable to human impacts
since they integrate and accumulate material and pollutants from the
drainage basin and receive discharges of nutrients leading to water
quality deterioration (Branco & Senna 1996, Figueredo & Giani 2001,
Dong et al. 2008, Fontana et al. 2014, Zorzal-Almeida et
al. 2017). Moreover, shallow systems are usually more susceptible to
eutrophication due to the water-sediment interaction and feedback mechanisms that
intensify the system resistance to restoration efforts (SÃ¸ndegaard et al.
2003, Bicudo et al. 2007).
