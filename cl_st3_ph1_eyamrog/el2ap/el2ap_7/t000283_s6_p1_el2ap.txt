This rapid living review will systematically evaluate the best available
evidence on the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19, which we expect
will help the front line on their decision-making processes. Currently,
there is no evidence from RCT that has shown potential
improvements in outcomes in patients with confirmed COVID-19. In addition
to the fact that there is no drug with proven
efficacy or approval by drug regulatory agencies for the treatment
of COVID-19. However, to date, there are almost two thousand
ongoing trials on SARS-CoV-2 infection registered in WHO ICTRP. While
different therapeutic classes emerge as possible treatments against COVID-19, the
availability of drug-related information, time to clinical improvement, adverse events
and mortality rate are still challenging. There is an urgent
need to find reliable evidence on which pharmacological treatment is
more effective and safer for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. To ensure
the quality of the results, we will follow the Cochrane
Handbook of Systematic Reviews recommendations (10). We believe this rapid
systematic review with network meta-analysis and extensive searches will be
able to summarize the current available evidence on pharmacological treatments
and to provide important information for clinical decision-making on COVID-19
that has recently emerged and caused a deadly pandemic.
