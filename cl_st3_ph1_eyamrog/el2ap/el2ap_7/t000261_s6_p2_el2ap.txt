The water quality of the system gradually has decreased since
the city zoo construction (1958) in a headspring area located
upstream Garças Reservoir, and further with the installation of the
Department of Agriculture (1975), both with no adequate sanitation and
contributing to high sewage loadings (table 3). As discussed by
Bicudo et al. (2007), the eutrophication led to seasonal cyanobacterial
blooms, the fast growth of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), and
a huge proliferation of mosquitoes. As a measure to control
the mosquitoes, most of the macrophytes were mechanically removed within
a few months during the period of cyanobacterial bloom (table
3). After such a controversial strategy, Garças Reservoir shifted in
a feedback mechanism with internal phosphorus loading and permanent cyanobacterial
blooms, jumping to an “irreversible degraded state”. The TSI captured
such an abrupt change (transition 1999-2000, figure 2) clearly showing
a jump to the hypereutrophic state. Bicudo et al. (2007)
presented a comprehensive discussion of such process synthesizing in distinct
limnological phases (I, II, and III, see reference) and the
consequences of such action.
