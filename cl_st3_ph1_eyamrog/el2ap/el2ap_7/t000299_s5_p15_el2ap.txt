Another protocol for pacifier disinfection was microwave. It is an
optional and easy procedure and can be used to eliminate
or reduce the presence of pathogenic microorganisms on the pacifier
surface [15]. It has also been shown to be effective
in disinfecting other dental materials, such as orthodontic instruments [32].
The microwave at power level 7 (corresponding to 70% of
total power) for 7 minutes was effective in pacifier disinfection
[3,8], considering S. mutans and C. albicans contamination for 7
minutes. The microwave, at full power for 5 minutes, also
obtained effective pacifier disinfection [15]. However, it must be evaluated
with caution due to the different parameters (power levels and
the models) of the microwave models.
