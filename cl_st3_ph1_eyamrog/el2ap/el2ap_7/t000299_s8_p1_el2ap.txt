Pacifier use is increasingly widespread in different modern cultures [1],
being one of the most common non-nutritive sucking habits of
children. They are used for various purposes, including the fact
that they soothe the child, favoring sleep and providing their
physiological and psychological needs [2]. Regarding the potential benefits and
risks of its use, there are controversial data [3], because,
in addition to the benefits, the association with microorganisms must
be considered, as it is a vehicle of contamination and
transmission [3,4].
