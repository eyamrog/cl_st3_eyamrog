During the preparation of this article, a paper was published
in which the authors made a cut of the analysis
on March 21 and found similar correlations of the importance
of BCG vaccination with the incidence and lethality of COVID-1912.
However, although the source of the data was similar, the
initial acceleration rates for the number of cases and the
number of deaths (0â€“100) and subsequent accelerations (from 101 to
April 11) were used in the present work. Further studies
will be done by the authors of this work on
the accelerations from April 11 to May 11 and finished
with accelerations from May 11 to June 11.
