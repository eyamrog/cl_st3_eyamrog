Other studies with S. brasiliensis Engl. showed that there is
a separation of phyotocompounds when the polarity is increased (Santos
et al. 2014). No fraction studied presented tannins equivalent to
catechin, but the EE showed 15.83 mg/g of tannins. This
may be related to the polarity of each solvent used,
which possibly resulted in the lack of extraction of compounds
with a polarity similar to catechin. This does not mean
that the samples produced with bark of S. brasiliensis Engl.
do not contain tannins. However, the amount of flavonoid found
in each fraction was higher than that found in the
EE, this is probably because the fractions of the compounds
are more concentrated than in the EE and therefore tend
to be higher. In their study, Santos et al. (2014)
observed qualitatively the presence of auronas, catechins, chalcones, flavonones, saponins
and tannins in the ethyl acetate fraction, while hexane fraction
and chloroform only steroids and triterpenes were identified, respectively. Differently
of our study, these authors did not quantify the compounds,
they only observed the full presence or absence, without using
a standard compound, which may have generated these different results
from the fraction of ethyl acetate. In addition, when working
with natural products and compounds, one must take into account
factors that influence the production of secondary metabolites by plant,
such as the period in which the plant was collected,
rainfall, seasonality, potential natural predators, etc (Gouvea et al. 2012,
Li et al. 2014, Moore et al. 2014). Thus, it
is possible to explain these differences by the fact that
those authors collected parts of Schinopsis brasiliensis in another region
and another period compared to our collection.
