(Plant community dynamics in an urban forest fragment of the
São Paulo Metropolitan Area, Brazil). We present a synthesis (2006-2012)
of plant community dynamics in an area (1 ha) of
the largest remnant of Atlantic Rain Forest surrounded by São
Paulo city. Plants with ≥ 2.5 cm dbh, including the
climbers, were sampled in 10 transects (2 × 50 m),
and the smaller (> 1 m height, < 2.5 cm
dbh) in 10 subtransects (1 × 50 m). We sampled
901 individuals, 125 species (38 families), 83 classified as late-successional
species, 12 threatened with extinction and 56 absent in the
area management plan, some Endangered (EN) species. The climbers were
the most dynamics, they had the largest decrease in basal
area; and the larger (> 5.0 cm dbh) and shorter
(< 2.5 cm dbh) trees had the highest mortality rates
of the shrub-tree synusia. Late species regeneration was predominant. The
studied forest showed progression towards more mature successional stages in
the monitoring period.
