The determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was performed as
recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI 2009).
The inoculum was standardized in tubes containing 5 mL of
0.9% sterile saline solution. The microbial suspension was adjusted using
a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-mini 1240 – São Paulo, Brazil) at
a wavelength of 625 nm, which is the equivalent to
106 Colony Forming Units per mL (CFU/mL). For this step,
the extract and the fractions were solubilized in 10% dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO - Merck - Darmstadt, Hessen, Germany). One hundred
microliters of each fraction or extract at a concentration of
500 mg/mL was serially diluted in brain heart infusion broth
(BHI – Difco - Detroit, MI, USA) in a 96-
well plate (TPP - Trasadingen, Switzerland) along with the positive
control (0.12% Chlorhexidine - Sigma-Aldrich - St. Louis, MO, USA).
Ten microliters of inoculation with the microorganism was added to
the wells. The plates were incubated at 37 ± 0.5
°C for 24 hours. The bacterial growth was indicated by
the addition of 20 µL of aqueous resazurin (Sigma-Aldrich -
St. Louis, MO, USA) at 0.01% with subsequent incubation at
37 ± 0.5 °C for two hours. Viable bacteria reduce
the dye, changing its color to blue and the MIC
was defined as the lowest concentration of test substance that
inhibited the change of color of resazurin.
