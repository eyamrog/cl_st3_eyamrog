In general, IBD patients taking immunomodulators may be more susceptible
to infection, especially in combination with biologics, mainly anti-TNF agents.
In addition, malnu- trition, comorbidities, older age, previous history of
serious infections, and underlying IBD activity may also be risk
factors for infections (14,15).
