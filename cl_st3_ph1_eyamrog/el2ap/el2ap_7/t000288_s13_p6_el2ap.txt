Viruses have developed the capacity to escape host immune detection
and to suppress the host IFN system.25 Viruses encode viral
proteins that interfere with PRRs signaling pathways to increase an
early benefit against host defense. For example, the SARS-CoV N
proteins inhibit RIG-I ubiquitination and thus suppress the release of
type I IFN,26 SARS-CoV M proteins prevents the TRAF3/ TBK1
complex formation and inhibits TBK1/IKKÎµ- dependent activation of IRF3/IRF7 transcription
factors.27 Lastly, the repressive modifications that are induced by the
nonstructural SARS-CoV nsp1 protein blocks host mRNA translation28 and mediates
host mRNA degradation.29
