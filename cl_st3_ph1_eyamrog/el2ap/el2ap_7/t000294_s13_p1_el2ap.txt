The term “virus” comes from Latin, understood as “poison” or
“toxin”. They are mostly 20-300 nm in diameter, have a
genome consisting of one or more nucleic acid molecules (DNA
or RNA), covered by a protein wrapper formed by one
or more proteins, and by a complex envelope in a
lipid bilayer.2 Coronaviruses are enveloped positive-RNA viruses, and have a
unique replication strategy, which makes it possible to vary their
pathogenicity and ease of adaptation in different environments.2
