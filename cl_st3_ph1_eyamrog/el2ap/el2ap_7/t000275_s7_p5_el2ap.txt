There is evidence that laparoscopic procedures can disperse aerosol attached
to viral particles5,6. However, it is still questionable whether conventional
open access procedures are safer than laparoscopic in the context
of COVID-197. Products such as the AirSeal iFS® System or
Laparoshield ™ Laparoscopic Smoke Filtration System, manufactured specifically for laparoscopic
smoke filtering with the goal of removing particles, cells and
viruses, have already been developed and approved to use, although
there are no studies showing their effectiveness, specifically against COVID-19,
so far. However, the availability of these devices in a
pandemic scenario, and specifically in low income countries are scarce.
