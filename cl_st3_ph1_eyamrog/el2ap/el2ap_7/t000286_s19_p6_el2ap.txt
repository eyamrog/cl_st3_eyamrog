The normalized co-integrating coefficients for two co-integrating equation given by
the long-run relationship is: <>, where FDI is the dependent
variable, -0.001076 is the coefficient of GD, - 0.240732 is
the coefficient of INF, 0.213348 is the coefficient of INT
and -0.003069 is the coefficient of EXC. The sign borne
by the adjusted coefficient estimates of GD, INF, and EXC
is negative. Which implies that the long run relationship between
GD, INF, EXC and FDI is negative. While, the sign
borne by the adjusted coefficient estimates of INT is positive
and it implies that the long run relationship between INT
and FDI is positive.
