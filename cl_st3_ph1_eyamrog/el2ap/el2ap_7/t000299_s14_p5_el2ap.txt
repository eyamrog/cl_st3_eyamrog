Two reviewers (VS and DL) extracted data independently by using
a standardized form. The following factors were recorded when the
information contained in the reviewed articles was available: country of
study, type of study, pacifier material, sample number (n), microorganisms
analyzed, decontamination methods used, method accessibility and results found. In
case of difference, a consensus was decided by the supervisor
(FM). Owing to the studies heterogeneity, no meta-analysis could be
achieved, but study characteristics and results were qualitatively analyzed.
