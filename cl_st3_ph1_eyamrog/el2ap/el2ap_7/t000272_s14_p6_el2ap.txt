The preparation of the red blood cells for the cytotoxicity
assay followed the method described by Cruz-Silva et al. (2000).
Whole blood from a voluntary individual working in our laboratory,
type O+, was collected and placed in a tube containing
heparin. The plasma was removed after centrifugation at 2500 rpm
for 5 minutes. Subsequently, the suspension of erythrocytes was washed
three times with 1% saline solution. The erythrocytes were re-suspended
in the same solution and the volume was adjusted to
5%. Then 1.5 mL of 5% erythrocyte suspension was added
together with 1.5 mL of test solution at concentrations of
1.0 mg/mL, 2.5 mg/mL and 5.0 mg/mL in tubes, remaining
for 1 hour at room temperature for the hemolysis to
occur. After this period, each tube was centrifuged at 2500
rpm for 10 minutes, and the supernatant removed for reading
in a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-mini - 1240) at a wavelength
of 540 nm (Cruz-Silva et al. 2001). The positive control
used was Turk's solution 1% negative and 1% saline solution.
The analysis was performed in triplicate. The calculation of the
potential hemolyzing substances followed the following equation: Hp = Ae
‚àíAb At ùë• 100 Where: Hp = Hemolyzing potential (in
percentage) Ae = Absorbance of test sample Ab = Absorbance
of the Negative Control At = Absorbance of the Positive
Control
