At the present time, it does not seem appropriate to
recommend discontinuing immunosuppressant treatment in patients with IBD (11). There
is a risk of reactivation of the disease for those
patients who stop their treatment, and active inflammation is associated
with an increased risk of hospitalization, surgery, infection, and exposure
to steroids (which should be avoided in the context of
COVID-19) (20,30).
