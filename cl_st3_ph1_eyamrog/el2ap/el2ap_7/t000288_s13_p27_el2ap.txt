The dental class, which comprises in its vast majority, autonomous
professionals, should recover the issues of financial education, frequently so
distant from the contents of the academic curriculum. There is
an evident scarcity of articles related to financial education for
dental offices. Emergency financial reserve, funds to deposit this reserve
and long-term investments, public or private pension, should be part
of the incisive recommendations to this group. Other professional classes
are raising these issues concerning this urgent moment to guarantee
social security for all and to go beyond the packages
proposed by governments.77 Such strategies must be sustainable, long-term, with
a view to protecting the self-employed and avoiding an unprecedented
economic crisis.
