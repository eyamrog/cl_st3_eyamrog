For evaluating prognosis, we will perform analyses according to the
recommendations of Cochrane, and the Cochrane Prognosis Methods Group. To
perform the meta-analysis we will use R software. When the
response of interest is provided by continuous variable we will
perform the analysis in terms of mean difference (MD) or
Hedge’s/Cohen’s (SMD). In case of dichotomous response will pool a
hazard ratios (unadjusted (crude) or adjusted) or odds ratio with
their standard errors for hospital admission, intensive care unit admission
and/or respiratory support for adult inpatients with COVID-19 and mortality.
All others parameters as standard deviation (for MD or SMD,
for instance) and each number of events (RR or OR,
for instance) will be pooled. In all cases we will
use the generic inverse variance method with random-effects model. The
package to be used is the “meta” (version 4.11-0).
