From the VECM result, ECM (-1) was consistent by assuming
a negative value. It suggests that the ECM could correct
any deviation from the long run equilibrium relationship between POV
and the explanatory variables. The coefficient indicates a speedy adjustment
of 1.99% per annum. This implies that following short-run disequilibrium,
1.99% of the adjustment to the long-run takes place within
one year. The above result shows that the R2 is
0.35, which shows that the model explains about 35% of
the total variations in FDI are explained by the independent
variables (GD, INF, INT and EXC) during the period of
the study while the remaining 65% is explained by variable
not included in the model.
