Similar results were found for the weighted SARS-Cov-2 antibody prevalence.
The same variables found to be significantly associated to the
crude prevalence were also significantly associated with the weighted prevalence.
However, weighting of the sample resulted in more accentuated statistical
significance for the 18-29 age group (OR=1.86; 95% CI 1.12-3.08%);
for lower education level (OR=2.11; 95% CI 1.35- 3.28); and
for condominium donors (OR=0.45; 95% CI 0.23-0.86%) as compared to
Hemorio blood donor. Time period was also significantly associated to
the weighted prevalence (p<0.005), nevertheless the OR was a little
higher for the crude prevalence.
