Due to the satisfactory antimicrobial activity found against bacteria involved
in the initial colonization of the tooth surface and at
the start of caries, along with the low cytotoxicity and
high selectivity, all samples of the EE of the bark
from Schinopsis brasiliensis Engl, are potential ingredients that could be
used in dental formulations to control oral biofilm.
