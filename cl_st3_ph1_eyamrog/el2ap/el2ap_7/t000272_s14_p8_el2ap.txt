For the determination of total flavonoid content, the method proposed
by Meda et al. (2005) was followed. Aluminum chloride (AlCl3)
was added to the extract and diluted in 2% methanol.
After waiting 10 minutes, the sample was taken to a
spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV mini - 1240) at an absorbance of
415 nm. The calibration curve was obtained using solutions of
quercetin. The concentration of flavonoids was expressed in milligrams equivalent
of quercetin.
