Physical distancing and self-isolation measures result in reduced opportunities for
MVPA practice since stadiums, parks, and gyms are closed. Moreover,
multiple leisure activities available for those in self-isolation at home
include sedentary activities, such as watching television, and seated computer
activities. Given the potential influence of the COVID-19 crisis on
lifestyle behaviours, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and the known association
between depressive and anxiety symptoms, it is essential to understand
the potential relationship between MVPA and SB with depressive/anxiety symptoms
in the context of COVID-19.
