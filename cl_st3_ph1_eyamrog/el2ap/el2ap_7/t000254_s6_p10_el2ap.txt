The soil of the park is very acidic and poor
in nutrients (Struffaldi De Vuono 1985, Gomes & Mantovani 2001);
however, it is similar to that of other forests in
Southeastern Brazil (Gomes & Mantovani 2001). Moraes (2002) in a
study of litter production and decomposition in the 1990s found
no abnormalities in a preserved area of the park. An
important fact to consider is that the park vegetation was
exposed to gas emissions from a nearby steel mill for
about 60 years. These gases were responsible for the pollution
of the forest, death of trees and the degraded state
of part of the vegetation, according to Struffaldi-De-Vuono (1985). Nagaoka
& Marcelli (1989) also attributed the considerable decrease of lichens
in the park to this factor. The area is still
exposed to air pollution from its fully urbanized surroundings. Domingos
et al. (2002) found some evidence of atmospheric pollution in
herbaceous bioindicator plants located outside the forest. Therefore, specific studies
are needed in the current decade, considering trees and lianas
developing in forest soil, to test the cumulative and current
effects of pollution on plant dynamics.
