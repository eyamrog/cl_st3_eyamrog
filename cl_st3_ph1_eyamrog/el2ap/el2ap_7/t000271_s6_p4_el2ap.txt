The results of our study indicate that the aim of
building an effective level of herd immunity would be challenging
to be achieved in the short term. Therefore, any relaxing
of social distancing recommendations might be unwise in the immediate
horizon and would have to be carefully considered in the
future, taking into consideration the degree of availability of hospital
infrastructure, in particular ICU beds and ventilators, to provide adequate
care for severe COVID-19 patients. Besides, it is not clear
whether the antibody response provides the necessary neutralizing effect for
avoiding a new infection [24]. If just a fraction of
individuals with antibodies shows neutralizing antibodies, then the target herd
immunity level would have to be increased. In this situation,
it is most likely that the desired level of herd
immunity will not be achieved before an effective vaccine becomes
available.
