The discrepancy in the author's productivity can be partially explained
by the context of each individual. For example, author productivity
is not linked to collaborative authorship, but collaborative authorship can
influence an author's productivity during a given period, as was
the case with this research when considering all authors and
co-authors, perhaps this can explain in this study, the framing
of the law of the inverse square and an Elite
Group of authors.
