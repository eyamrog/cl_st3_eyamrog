It is transmitted after contact with infected surfaces and with
infected patient’s fluids, including saliva and aerosol.6,7 These characteristics place
the dental offices as main risk settings of cross infection

including hospital’s dental intensive care facilities.8 Dental practitioners are exposed
to close contact to patients, to saliva aerosol, blood and
handle sharp contaminated instruments.9
