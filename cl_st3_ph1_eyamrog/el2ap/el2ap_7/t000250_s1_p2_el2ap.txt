Methods: Cross-sectional online survey in self-isolating people. Self-reported MVPA, VPA,
MPA, and SB (exposures), and depressive and anxiety symptoms (Beck
Depression and Anxiety Inventories [BDI and BAI]) were collected. Associations
of MVPA, VPA, MPA, and SB with prevalent depressive (BDI>9),
anxiety (BAI>7), and D&A (BDI>9+BAI>7) symptoms were investigated using logistic
regressions, presented as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval
(95%CI). Linear regressions were performed testing associations with symptom severity.
Models were adjusted for confounding factors.
