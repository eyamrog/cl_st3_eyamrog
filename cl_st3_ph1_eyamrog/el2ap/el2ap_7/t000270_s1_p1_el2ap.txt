(PEFI algal flora: a half-century of investigation) The survey of
the algal flora of the Parque Estadual das Fontes do
Ipiranga (PEFI) started in 1962, with the disclosure of occurrence
of 17 desmid species, collected from the São Paulo Botanical
Gardens hydrophytoterium. However, in an organized way, it took place
only 28 years later, in 1990, with the conception of
the “Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga Cryptogamic flora”. The
flora is essentially based on material gathered from the plankton,
periphyton and surface sediments of the PEFI water bodies, and
also included samples from trees barks, rocks, and soil. Forty-two
fascicles of the algal flora have already been published, revealing
869 taxa including species, varieties and taxonomic formae. It is
estimated that 95% of the local algal flora have already
been surveyed and that its conclusion will be reached by
the end of the year 2020.
