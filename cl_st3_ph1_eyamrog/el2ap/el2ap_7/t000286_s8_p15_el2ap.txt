In this connection, Erdem and Yamak (2016) conducted economic analysis
to create an Optimal Uncertainty Index for Turkey at the
macroeconomic level. The studyâ€™s data covered the period between 2002
and 2014 based on quarterly data. The analysis was conducted
using seemingly unrelated regression (SUR), ordinary least squares (OLS), and
the generalized method of moments (GMM).
