Secondary forests in different regenerative processes, like the disturbed forests,
are among one of the main remaining ecosystems from tropical
forests. Much of the biodiversity, such as endangered and rare
species, are restricted to fragments of this forest (Brown &
Lugo 1990, FAO 2010, Farah et al. 2017). Different disturbance
histories, local conditions, and local resources have directed these environments
in unknown directions, making forecast and diagnosis difficult, for management
purposes (Chazdon et al. 2007, Rodrigues et al. 2009, Norden
et al. 2009). One example is Parque Estadual das Fontes
do Ipiranga (PEFI), the largest Atlantic Forest remnant with completely
urbanized surroundings in the Metropolitan Region of SÃ£o Paulo, one
of the most populous regions in the world (SMA 2008).
