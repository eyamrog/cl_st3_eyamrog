Furthermore, social distancing is also among the priorities of institutions
to decrease transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Separation minimizes contact between potentially
infected and healthy individuals, or between groups with high rates
of transmission and or those with no or low levels,
in order to delay the peak of the epidemic and
lessen the magnitude of its effects, to protect assistance capacity
clinic.8 Isolation effectiveness depends on some epidemiological parameters, such as
the number of secondary infections generated by each new infection
and the proportion of transmissions that occur before the onset
of symptoms.14-15 These measures are justified due to the risk
that asymptomatic people who remain in the community may infect
others until their isolation, which makes it a challenge to
control the pandemic. Based on this premise, Figure 1 shows
the main public health measures to be adopted early to
reduce the impact of the pandemic.
