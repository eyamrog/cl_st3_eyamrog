Therefore, it is highly recommended by most surgical socie- ties
around the world to postpone all elective surgeries and endoscopic
procedures, aiming to protect patients and sur- geons and also
to minimize the use of necessary resources, such as hospital
beds and personal protective equipment (PPE) (32,33). Regarding the surgical
procedure, there is concern for the aerosolization of the SARS-CoV-2
virus in minimally invasive procedures, although there is no robust
evidence. This could also be the case with electrocautery use
during open surgery. Strict use of PPE according to local
practice is advisable, which includes an N95 mask and face
shield protection. Negative pressure surgical rooms should be used if
available and for laparoscopic surgery, a smoke evacuation system is
advisable. Additionally, only essential staff should take part in the
surgery.
