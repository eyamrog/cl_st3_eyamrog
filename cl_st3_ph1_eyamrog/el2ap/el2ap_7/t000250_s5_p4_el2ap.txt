We found significant associations between increased time spent in SB
and depression and anxiety symptom severity when adjusting for covariates
such as time spent in MVPA. Moreover, those spending over
10 hours in SB per day were more likely to
present prevalent depressive, but not anxiety or co-occurring D&A symptoms18,
30. This difference might be explained by the fact that
periods longer than 10 hours per day of SB are
needed to impact significantly in the presence of significant anxiety
symptoms17.
