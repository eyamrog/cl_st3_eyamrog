On the other hand, despite this positive trend, Turkey encountered
with various regional and international challenges from 2008 on. First
of all, 2008 Global Financial Crisis is considered by many
economists as the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression
during the 1930s. The crisis directly affected international trade and
financial flows all around the world. Although the crisis is
not initiated by the developing countries, it affected them more
including Turkey by mounting their deficits in trade and payment
balances, along with triggering currency devaluations, increasing inflation rates, and
public budget deficits. Turkish economy was adversely affected by the
crisis most visible on the sharp decline on country’s export
and a significant sudden stop in financial flows (Cömert and
Çolak, 2014).
