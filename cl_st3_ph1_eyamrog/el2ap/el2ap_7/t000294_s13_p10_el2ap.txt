This measure can limit the spread of respiratory diseases, including
the new coronavirus. However, only mask use is insufficient to
provide safe level of protection in isolation, and should always
be associated with those already referred to as hand hygiene,
especially before and after using masks. It should also be
remembered that wearing masks when not indicated can generate unnecessary
costs and create a false sense of security, inducing negligence
to other measures, such as hand hygiene and cleaning of
inanimate surfaces potentially contaminated with SARS-CoV -2.22-23
