The results revealed that INT does not granger causes FDI;
the null hypothesis is accepted at 5% significance level, indicated
by the high probability value 0.1538. The results also revealed
that FDI does not granger causes INT, the null hypothesis
is accepted at 5% percent indicated by the probability value
0.8541 and this is confirmed by the F-statistics value 0.15915.
