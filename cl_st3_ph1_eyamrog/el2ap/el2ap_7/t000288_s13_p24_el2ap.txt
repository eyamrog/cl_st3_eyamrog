In this unprecedented situation, it is advisable to look for
and apply the most recent protocols and guidance from your
local dental organizations in your country that are based in
the current literature and be aware that the COVID-19 pandemic
brings challenges to the dental health care providers not only
on their practices but on their financial situation as well.
A general flowchart (Figure) was constructed based on the ADA’s
Interim guidance on minimizing COVID-19 transmission risk when treating dental
emergencies.64 As also stated in this ADA’s document,64 Figure 1
does not constitute legal advice or legal guidance. It only
helps clinicians for their own judgment about the risks of
infection while working in dental offices.
