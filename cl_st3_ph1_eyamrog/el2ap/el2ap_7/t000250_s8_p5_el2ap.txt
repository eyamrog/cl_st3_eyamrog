To the best of our knowledge, no study has evaluated
the associations between MVPA, and SB with depressive, anxiety, and
co-occurring depressive and anxiety (D&A) symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The present study aimed to 1) examine levels of MVPA,
and SB during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil; 2) examine
the presence of depressive, anxiety, and D&A symptoms in Brazil;
3) explore associations between MVPA, and SB with depressive, anxiety,
and D&A symptoms; and 4) explore associations of different intensities
(vigorous physical activity [VPA] or moderate physical activity [MPA]) with
depressive, anxiety, and co- occurring D&A symptoms.
