Those reporting ≥30 minutes in MVPA had a decreased odds
of prevalent depressive (OR=0.71, 95%CI=0.53-0.96), anxiety (OR=0.72, 95%CI=0.54-0.96), and co-occurring
D&A (OR=0.71, 95%CI=0.52-0.96) symptoms when adjusting for potential covariates. Those
spending ≥10 hours per day in SB were more likely
to present prevalent depressive symptoms (OR=1.39, 95%CI=1.02-1.90) in the most
adjusted analyses. The detailed results of the logistic regression models
are presented in table 2. Linear associations, adjusting for relevant
covariates, demonstrate that each hour spent in SB is associated
with 0.22 points higher on the BDI (95%CI=0.104-0.338) and 0.16
points higher at the BAI (95%=CI=0.021-0.313). The linear models for
MVPA and SB are shown in table 3.
