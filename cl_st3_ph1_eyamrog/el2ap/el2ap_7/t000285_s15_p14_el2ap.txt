To assess the feasibility of performing a meta-analysis, we will
also extract the following data for each primary and secondary
outcome measure: (a) Total number of patients (in each group);
(b) Number of events in each group (for dichotomous outcomes);
(c) Mean, standard deviation, standard error, median, interquartile range, minimum,
maximum, 95% confidence interval (CI) (for continuous outcomes); (d) p-value.
