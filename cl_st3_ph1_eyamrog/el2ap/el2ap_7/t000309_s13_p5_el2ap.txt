Guan et al. did not observe the use of immunomodulators
as a risk factor for serious diseases in 1,099 patients
in China (18). As of April 3, 2020, 12 deaths
(9 male) were reported among the 275 patients with IBD
and COVID-19 in the inter- national Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus
Under Research Exclusion (SECURE)-IBD database. Of those, three patients were
younger than 65 years old, and all received treatment with
more than one immunosuppressant (steroid+ JAK inhibitor; adalimumab+methotrexate; adalimumab+ azathioprine+steroid)
(19). Nevertheless, these cases should be interpreted with caution since
many cases with mild disease were not tested for COVID-19.
