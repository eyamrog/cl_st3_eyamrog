The association of malnourishment and the risk of infec- tions
is well described in IBD literature (23,24). Hypoalbu- minemia is
considered a systemic inflammatory marker and is present in one-fifth
of IBD patients (25,26). In the present context of the
COVID-19 pandemic, social isolation could negatively impact the patientâ€™s access
to healthy foods or dietary habits resulting in ensuing nutritional
deficits. Thus, we have recommended a balanced diet with four
to six small meals a day and adequate hydration. All
patients were also encouraged to quit smoking.
