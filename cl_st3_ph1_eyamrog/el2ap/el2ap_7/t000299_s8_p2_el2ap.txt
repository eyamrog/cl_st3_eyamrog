Nowadays the humanity is facing a new challenge: to live
with the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Although the children are usually
asymptomatic for COVID-19, to the younger ones should be given
high attention since the number of cases on this group
are significantly high due to they do not wear masks
and have not taken other special preventive and control measures
[5]. Moreover, the pacifier could be considered a transmission way
once it is in narrow contact with the mouth and
the face. Pacifiers are in contact with saliva and oral
microbiota, which leads to the development of microbial biofilms on
their surfaces [4,6,7]. Pacifier falls are frequent, which exposes them
to a wide range of microorganisms, and it is often
returned to the mouth without prior cleaning and disinfection [4].
Pacifier use has also been associated with other diseases and
pathologies in children, such as fungal infections [7] and intestinal
parasitosis [4].
