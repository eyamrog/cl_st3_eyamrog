COVID-19 is transmitted mainly through respiratory drop- lets, aerosols, and
through the conjunctiva (2). The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 in
adults ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia and fatal
illness. The main clinical symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of
breath, myalgia, and 10-20% of patients develop acute respiratory distress
syndrome after 8â€“14 days of the illness (3). Based on
data from more than 72,000 patients from China, 81% of
the patients were mildly affected, 14% had severe manifesta- tions,
and 5% were critically ill. No deaths occurred in children
younger than 9 years but the mortality rate ranged from
8-15% in those aged older than 70 years (4). Risk
factors for severe illness were older age and pre-existing comorbid
conditions including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and
cancer. Children of all ages appeared susceptible to COVID-19, but
clinical manifestations were less severe compared to those seen in
adults (5). Around 6% of children suffered severe disease and
life-threatening conditions, but these patients commonly had a prior history
of congenital or acquired disease or were younger than 1
year (4,5).
