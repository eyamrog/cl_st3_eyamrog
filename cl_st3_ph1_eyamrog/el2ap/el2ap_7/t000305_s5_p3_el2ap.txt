The acceleration in the number of deaths in the D30
of the countries in group 1 remained four times higher
than in group 2 and 2a. It is expected that
the fact that this work has been based on the
acceleration of the indexes will remain with statistical significance in
future analyses on May 21 and June 21. The importance
of this future analysis is to reinforce the protective hypothesis
of the BCG vaccination program primarily in unvaccinated and high-risk
populations for the development of the severe form of COVID-19.
At the same time, there is no specific vaccine against
the new coronavirus.
