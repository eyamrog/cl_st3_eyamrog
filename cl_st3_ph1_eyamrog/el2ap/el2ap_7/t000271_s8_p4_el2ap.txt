The quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is the
gold standard for virus detection and COVID-19 confirmation [9]. Some
studies show a high prevalence of false-negative tests because factors
such as type of biological sample, inadequate sample collection, fluctuation
of viral load and time between collection and the onset
of symptoms can influence the test outcome [10]. In this
context, it is essential to perform serological tests, either to
investigate the presence of acute-phase antibodies (IgM) or memory antibodies
(IgG). Due to the need for quick results, a simple,
sensitive and specific test is essential, with immediate and accurate
results to promptly identify patients who have been infected with
SARS-CoV-2 to facilitate the control of viral transmission and ensure
timely public health interventions [11].
