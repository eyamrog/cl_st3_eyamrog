Here, we have expanded the comparative analysis to more species
and sites of interaction between ACE2 orthologues and SARS-CoV-like viruses.
In sum, our results show that ACE2 murine species have
only 56% of identity with human ACE2, and have also
several critical taxon- specific changes that explain the barrier to
infection with SARS-CoV-2. For the other species and taxon investigated
here, however, the ability to block (or not) the infection
to SARS-CoV-2 via this receptor is not easy to predict.
At the moment, preliminary results indicate that a macaque (Macaca
mulatta) inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 recapitulates moderate respiratory disease observed in
the majority of human cases (Munster et al., 2020). Note
that Macaca mulatta, similar to other species of the family
Cercopithecidae, has only one change (R559K) relative to human and
other species of the family Hominidae (Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus
and Gorilla gorilla; Figure 2). We also found a set
of AA changes in the ACE2 of NWm species, which
can characterize different patterns of binding to SARS-CoV-2, making them
potentially less susceptible to the infection than humans and great
apes. Earlier, one in vivo study (Greenough et al., 2005)
demonstrated SARS-CoV infection outcome in Callithrix sp., however, the pattern
of virus replication and the potential risk for infection in
nature for this and other NWm species has never been
demonstrated. Therefore, Callithrix sp., although being a good model for
MERS-CoV infection (McAuliffe et al., 2004; Van Doremalen and Munster,
2015), it has not been established as an animal model
to SARS-CoV infection. Note that MERS-CoV uses another host-cell entry
receptor, DPP4, rather than ACE2.
