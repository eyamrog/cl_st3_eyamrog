Comparing the dynamics of the two successional plant groups with
> 2.5 cm dbh showed that the annual mortality of
early-successional plants did not differ from that of late-successional plants
(Mann-Whitney Test, U = 45, p = 0.73, table 4),
whereas the annual recruitment of late-successional plants was higher than
that of early-successional plants (U = 22, p = 0.02,
figure 5).
