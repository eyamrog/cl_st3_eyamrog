Another possible way to perform the smoke evacuation suction circuit
in the absence of the previously mentioned chemical substances is
by connecting a ventilation machine filter to the terminal portion
of the suction cable connected to the surgical trocar. The
remaining part of the filter system is then connected to
a second plastic suction cable, directing the smoke to the
water seal device filled with saline solution.
