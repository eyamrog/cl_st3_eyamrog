The methodological quality of the studies was independently evaluated by
the two reviewers (VS and DL). Differences were resolved with
the supervisor (FM). The risk of bias was assessed according
to: randomization of the selected pacifiers, use of a disinfection
control material (sterile water), similar sample size, clearly described protocol,
selection of more than one disinfection method and statistical analysis.
If the study had the item, it received a "yes"
and if there was no information, it received "no". For
one to two "no", the study was considered as “low
risk of bias”; for three or four was considered as
"average risk of bias"; for five to six yes, the
study was considered "high risk of bias". Disagreements between the
reviewers in relation to quality assessment were resolved by supervisor
(FM).
