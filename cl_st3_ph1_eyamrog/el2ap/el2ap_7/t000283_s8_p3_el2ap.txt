Although mortality rate is concerning, the high transmissibility of the
disease is much more alarming. Even if a low percentage
of patients need hospitalization, the rapid spread of the disease
and large number of people infected has overwhelmed the healthcare
systems worldwide. To counteract the spread, severe social distancing measures—travel
restrictions, closures of schools, and many businesses—are taking an unprecedented
socioeconomic and psychological toll. Therefore, COVID-19 has caused an enormous
impact on people’s quality of life and posed far-reaching threats,
especially to the economy, health, and to the sustainability of
healthcare systems (4).
