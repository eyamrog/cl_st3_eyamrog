Considering this potential for contamination and transmission of microorganisms, especially
the SARS-CoV-2, proper disinfection of pacifiers is essential [4,8,9], as
it is not always performed correctly in everyday life and
it is only washed in running water and dried [10].
There are limited studies worldwide on these disinfection methods and
their effectiveness in reducing contamination. The goal should not be
to discourage use, but to ensure that the pacifiers are
disinfected [11], to promote oral health and to prevent oral
infections in children [9].
