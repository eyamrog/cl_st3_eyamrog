SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the current pandemic of Corona Virus
Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) (Chan et al., 2020; Coronaviridae Study
Group, 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020).
The COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan (China) in December
2019 and spread worldwide, with a high rate of transmission,
thousands of infected patients and many deaths between December 2019
and April 2020, and these numbers continue to grow. On
March 11, World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a
pandemic, the first one caused by a coronavirus (WHO, situation
report, March 11, 2020). SARS-CoV-2 causes a severe respiratory syndrome
in humans, being transmitted arguably through different routes (i.e., fomites,
airborne or fecal-oral) by an animal to human and human
to humans (Chan et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020;
Li et al., 2020b), similar to SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome-related coronavirus) and MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus). SARS-CoV
was initially transmitted to humans by the palm civet (Paguma
larvata; Kan et al., 2005) and MERS-CoV by the dromedary
(Camelus dromedarius; Zaki et al., 2012). SARS-CoV-2 is classified as
Beta coronavirus subgenus Sar becovirus with ~70% of similarity with
SARS-CoV (Wu et al., 2020). Genetic studies from different research
groups found that SARS-CoV-2 is highly similar to the bat
(Rhinolophs affinis) coronavirus (Guo et al., 2020; Ji et al.,
2020; Li et al., 2020b; Wu et al., 2020; Zhou
et al., 2020). Other studies comparing genomes of different coronaviruses
showed local genomic similarities between the human coronavirus and those
from snakes, turtles, pangolins, and minks, suggesting these animals as
possible intermediate-hosts (Guo et al., 2020; Ji et al., 2020;
Li et al., 2020c; Liu et al., 2020; Wan et
al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). The most recent metagenomic
study on the topic reinforces the idea that pangolins (Manis
javanica) should be considered as the most plausible intermediate-host of
SARS-CoV-2 related viruses, and that they acquired these viruses independently
from bats or another animal hosts (Lam et al., 2020).
The authors found putative recombination signals between the pangolins coronaviruses,
bat coronaviruses, and human SARS-CoV-2 (Lam et al., 2020), which
highlights the complexity of the origin of the new human
coronavirus. Although there are uncertainties about the original and intermediate
hosts, mutation and/or recombination among coronaviruses may have enabled cross-species
infection (Letko et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2020).
