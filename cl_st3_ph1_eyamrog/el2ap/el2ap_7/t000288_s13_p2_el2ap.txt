This new viral agent, which until that moment has not
been identified in humans before, was called SARS-CoV-2 and is
able to cause respiratory infectious disease that is called COVID-19.
Previous occurrence of coronavirus such as the Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (MERS-CoV)
left 774 and 850 dead, respectively, reflecting the severity of
the threat and the urgency to control this new outbreak
