Although the studied area shows progress toward a mature stage
of regeneration as discussed initially, specific studies are needed to
directly assess the influence of the factors mentioned here on
forest dynamics. For an isolated forest fragment as the one
in the present study, within a highly urbanized area, without
any nearby forest fragments, what is expected is an erosion
of species in time (Turner et al. 1995, Turner 1996).
On the other hand, the local history (Chazdon et al.
2007, Norden et al. 2009), more protective actions in the
area in relation to removal of flora and fauna specimens,
fewer occurrences of fire and especially cessation of emissions from
the neighboring steel mill have favored the regeneration of the
vegetation cover, as also shown in another area of the
Park (Gomes et al. 2003). Despite it is isolated and
has fully urbanized surroundings, the remnant is an important source
of propagules and shelter of various endangered species, besides providing
ecosystem services. This reinforces the importance of this urban forest,
in the face of the numerous anthropic pressures. The permanent
monitoring of the community and of existing populations of this
and other areas of the fragment, including the climbing plants,
may explain how diversity relates to ecosystem resilience and to
local factors that can influence forest health.
