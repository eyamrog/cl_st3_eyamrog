Coronavirus is a family of viruses that causes respiratory infections
including the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) discovered in December 2019 in
China. Coronaviruses represent enveloped, positive stranded RNA virus that contains
four genera: Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltacoronavirus.1 Six different coronavirus
have been identified in humans: HCoV-OC43, -229E, HCoV-NL63, HKU1, the
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV and (SARS)-CoV.2 Although the latter
virus became widely discussed recently, the first human coronaviruses were
isolated for the first time in 1937.3 The denomination coronavirus
was due to its microscopic aspect resembling crown-like spikes on
its surface and the main host receptor for humans seems
to be the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).4
