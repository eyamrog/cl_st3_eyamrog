Pacifiers, widely used by children, are constantly in contact with
saliva and mouth microorganisms4. They can be considered a vehicle
for contamination and microbial transmission3, especially the SARS-CoV-2, which requires
their correct hygiene [4,8,9]. Moreover, children are very special susceptible
group for COVID-19 due to the immaturity of their immune
systems [16] and close family contacts been susceptible to cross-infection
[17]. Since the SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by aerosols and
close contact, attention in pacifier disinfection must be reinforced during
the pandemic times.
