We also observed a Serine (S) at the positively selected
site 559, which reduces or inhibits the interaction of SARS-CoV
S glycoprotein with ACE2 (Li et al., 2005b). A Serine
in that position is found not only in rodents but
also in some species of carnivores that were already considered
as possible original or intermediate hosts, such as the pangolin
(Manis javanica). Pangolin ACE2 has ~85% of similarity with human
ACE2 (Lam et al., 2020), but only 66% considering just
these 30 sites investigated here. In addition, a Serine at
position 559 is also observed in the two species of
the Mustelidae family, ferret (Mustela putorius) and sea otter (Enhydra
lutris).
