The novel coronavirus has created a new dilemma for surgeons
worldwide. While many patients await surgery, the risks of developing
severe pulmonary infection and pro- longed hospitalization are concerning. This
is particularly critical for IBD patients, who are immunosuppressed by
both the nature of the disease and commonly used medications,
in addition to nutritional deficits. Surgical care in this context
may add additional morbidity.
