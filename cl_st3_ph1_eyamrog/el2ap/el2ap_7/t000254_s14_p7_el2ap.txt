Shrubs and trees individuals sampled in 2006 and those recruited
during the study period were identified via comparison with herbarium
specimens, references in the relevant literature and confirmation with researchers
from the Herbarium of the São Paulo Botanical Institute (SP)
and from the São Paulo Forestry Institute (SPSF). The botanical
nomenclature from the Brazilian Flora Species List (Flora do Brasil
2020 under construction 2019) was used, according to the APG
IV system (APG IV 2016). Vouchers have been deposited in
the Herbarium of the São Paulo Botanical Institute (SP, Maria
Eneyda, P. K. Fidalgo).
