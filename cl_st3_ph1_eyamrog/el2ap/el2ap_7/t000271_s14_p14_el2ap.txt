For the statistical analysis, we considered two outcomes: the unadjusted
and weighted prevalence of the SARS-Cov-2 antibody test. Also, the
following variables were included in the analysis: sex, age group
(18-29; 30-49; 50+), blood donation site (Hemorio, churches, condominiums), education
level (no college education; college education) and place of residence
(capital; other cities in the State of Rio de Janeiro).
To investigate a possible increasing trend, the test dates were
aggregated in three time periods (April 14th to 18th; April
19th to 23rd; April 24th to 27th).
