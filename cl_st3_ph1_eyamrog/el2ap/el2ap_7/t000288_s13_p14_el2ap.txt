Lastly, clinical trials are being conducted to evaluate the use
of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma from persons who have recovered from
COVID-19 that potentially contain antibodies to treat patients with life-threatening
viral infections.43 A group led by Lei Liu44 gave convalescent
plasma (total dose: 400 mL with a SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody-IgG titer
greater than 1:1,000) to five critically ill patients and the
symptoms diminished in all of them within ten days. Even
though these cases reported by Shen et al 44 are
compelling, this investigation has some limitations. The intervention was not
evaluated in a randomized clinical trial, and the outcomes in
the treatment group were not compared with outcomes in a
control group - patients who did not receive the intervention.
Moreover, patients received numerous other therapies (antiviral and steroids), and
the convalescent plasma was administered up to 21 days, and
it is not clear whether this timing is optimal or
if earlier administration potentially have been associated with different outcomes.
Despite these limitations, the study does provide important evidence to
support the possibility of evaluating this therapy in more rigorous
studies.
