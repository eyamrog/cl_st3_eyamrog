Prior studies found a high sensitivity (97%) and low to
moderate specificity (25â€“56%), however they did not define the criteria
used to classify chest CT findings as positive in that
study(11,18). On the other hand, Bai et al. demonstrated that
CT has a high specificity to differenti- ate COVID-19 from
other viral pneumonias, with mod- erate sensitivity(17). These findings suggest
that different criteria used to evaluate CT findings can achieve
different diagnostic accuracy results.
