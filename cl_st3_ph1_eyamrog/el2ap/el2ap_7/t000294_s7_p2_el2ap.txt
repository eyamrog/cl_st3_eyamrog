From virus isolation in initial cases, researchers identified genetic mutation
in a spike surface protein, which the virus uses to
attack the human organism and multiply.3 Little by little, information
about its incubation period, between two and ten days, and
of propagation through contaminated droplets, hands and surfaces were described
in the literature.4-5 Immediately, the news reports recorded increase in
infected people, deaths, and high rate of contamination in Wuhan,
where the first control measures included suspension of public transport,
closure of entertainment venues, prohibition of public meetings, cleaning of
buildings, streets and compulsory home restrictions on all citizens.6 Spread
of cases to other geographic areas has been greatly accelerated
due to globalization and lack of knowledge to adopt restrictive
measures for travelers. There were many questions and few answers
at first, a direct and active mobilization by WHO to
monitor cases and virus spread to all continents. Then, by
the results of the first researches, the picture was outlined
with human-human transmission of n-COVID-19.7
