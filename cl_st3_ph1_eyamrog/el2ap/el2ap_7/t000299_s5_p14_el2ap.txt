In addition, there is the issue of chlorhexidine-related microbial resistance,
which is still controversial [28]. If some studies have not
shown the emergence of resistant microorganisms [30], others have reported
that some strains may have the potential to develop tolerance
following prolonged exposure to chlorhexidine [31]. However, it is noteworthy
that, for pacifier disinfection, the adverse effects of chlorhexidine are
reduced, since the application is performed outside the mouth and
without direct mucosal exposure [10]. Therefore, it is necessary to
analyze the cost-benefit of using this antimicrobial agent.
