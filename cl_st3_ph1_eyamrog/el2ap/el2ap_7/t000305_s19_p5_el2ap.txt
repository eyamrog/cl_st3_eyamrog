Comparing group 1 with group 2, the ratio estimates indicate
that the incidence rate in group 1 is 21.36 times
higher than the same rate in group 2. Also, group
1 has a mortality rate of 53.21 times higher and
a lethality rate 2.49 times higher than group 2. This
behavior is likely to be related to the populations of
China and India, and the ratio will be reduced to
7.84 in the incidence ratio and 23.24 in the mortality
ratio when excluded for calculation purposes; however, the maintenance of
the lethality ratio occurs independently of the groups.
