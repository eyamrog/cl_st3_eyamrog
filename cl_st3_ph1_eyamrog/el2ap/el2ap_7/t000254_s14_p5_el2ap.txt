All individuals were marked with numbered plastic plates and fixed
with galvanized wire around the stem leaving room for the
plant to grow. The height of each individual was estimated
using a graduated ruler and an electronic measuring tape. The
diameter at breast height (dbh) of individuals, including all branches
with a dbh of at least > 2.5 cm, was
measured in late winter, between the second half of August
and the first half of September 2012, which is the
driest period of the year. That is, 6.5 years after
the first measurement that was performed on March 2006 (Davison
2009).
