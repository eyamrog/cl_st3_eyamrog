The changepoint analysis identified only one point dividing the TSI
time series into two segments (orange lines in figure 4a).
These segments represent significant mean and variance changes in the
TSI values over the time series. Following the same logic,
we identified in each segment a new changepoint to access
new mean changes in the data. We observed a mean
increase (64 to 71, figure 4a) followed by a mean
decrease (74 to 67, figure 4b) and finally a stable
mean value (67, figure 4c). This information was important to
the use of piecewise regression. The first mean change occurred
in August of 1999, and we used that first point
as a possible breakpoint in the breakpoint (segmented) regression. Still,
the breakpoint identified through the regression occurred in October of
2001. This means that we identified a significant TSI increase
followed by a significant decrease (figure 4b), which was demonstrated
through a positive regression coefficient (Time = 0.29) followed by
a negative coefficient (U1.Time = -0.34) (table 2). One can
notice the “not applicable (NA)” term as the P value
for U1.Time term (table 2). As previously discussed, the reason
is that standard methods do not apply. The Davies test
was significant, which provided us with had solid regression coefficients.
