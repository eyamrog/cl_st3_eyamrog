The results revealed that EXC does not granger causes INF;
the null hypothesis is accepted at 5% significance level, indicated
by the high probability value 0.0635. The results also revealed
that INF does not granger causes EXC, the null hypothesis
is accepted at 5% percent indicated by the probability value
0.4724 and this is confirmed by the F-statistics value 0.781.
This result therefore indicates no causation flowing from EXC to
INF.
