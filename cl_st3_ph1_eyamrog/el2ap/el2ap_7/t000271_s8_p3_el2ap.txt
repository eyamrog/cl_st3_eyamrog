The infection can cause mild symptoms, which usually start with
cough, muscle pain, and anosmia, progressing to high fever, pneumonia,
with severe lung involvement [4] and, in some cases, to
death [5, 6, 7]. However, the majority of the infections
can evolve with few or no symptoms, representing a significant
challenge to prevent disease dissemination, since asymptomatic people might be
a substantial source of transmission [8].
