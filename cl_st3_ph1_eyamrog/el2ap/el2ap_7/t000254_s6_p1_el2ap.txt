In 2006 and 2012 the most abundant species, considering all
sampled sizes, were late-successional species representative of the main families
appearing in later successional stages of the Dense Ombrophylous Forest
(Tabarelli & Mantovani 1999, Catharino 2006, Arzolla 2011). Myrtaceae, Lauraceae,
Rubiaceae, and Fabaceae were the richest families (around 50% of
the total species found, table 2), the first two with
the greatest richness which is characteristic of mature Dense Montane
Ombrophylous Forest (Tabarelli & Mantovani 1999, Franco et al. 2007,
Arzolla et al. 2011).
