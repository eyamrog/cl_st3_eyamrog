Conclusion: CT has a high accuracy for the diagnosis of
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Different interpretation criteria can provide either high sensitivity
or high specificity. CT should be integrated as a triage
test in resource-constrained environments during the pan- demic to assist
in the optimization of PCR-tests, isolation beds and intensive care
units.
