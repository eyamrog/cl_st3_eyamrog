Frequencies and percentages were used to describe categorical variables, and
mean, median, interquartile range (IQR) and range were used to
describe continuous variables. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, posi- tive predictive
value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for
two different scenarios. In the first scenario, only chest CT
with typical findings were considered positive, while in the second
scenario, chest CT with typical or indeterminate findings were considered
positive. The RT-PCR test was considered as the gold- standard.
Proportions were provided, along with binomial exact 95% confidence intervals
(CIs), using the “exact” Clopper-Pearson CIs for sensitivity and specificity,
and the standard logit CIs for PPV and NPV(25). We
compared sensitivity and specificity between both scenarios using the McNemar
test(26). P values less than 0.05 were con- sidered to
represent statistically significant differences. All analyses were performed using SPSS
software, version 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).
