Our comparative analysis of the ACE2 coding region from 70
placental mammal species, revealed many variable sites. Of these, we
selected 30 sites with records to be relevant for interaction
with SARS-CoV-like S glycoproteins. For three of them, there is
a significant signal of the action of the Darwinian (positive)
selection. We observed extraordinary conservation within Homo sapiens and relatively
high variation among placental mammal species. Our data indicate that
SARS-CoV-2 has similar potential to infect any human population, already
corroborated by the pandemic character of COVID-19. We can suggest
that any difference in the rate of infection and mortality
of this pathogen/disease among humans is related to other factors
such as comorbidities of the infected individuals, cultural practices, demographic
density, capacity of the country's health systems, suppression or mitigation
measures, in addition to differences in the SARS-CoV-2 strains, as
well as the effective innate immune response from infected individuals.
The involvement of other genetic pathways, in addition to the
ACE2 protein and the immune system, cannot be ruled out
either, but only the progress of the studies will be
able to identify them, as well as their eventual role
in the COVID-19 human pandemic.
