In 1997, it was initiated a monthly monitoring program of
the Gar√ßas Reservoir water quality. Based on a temporal series
of 8 years (1997-2004), two contrasting limnological phases were characterized,
i.e. before and after the mechanical removal of the macrophyte
Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms, which caused an abrupt change to
the hypertrophic state with the persistence of cyanobacterial blooms (Bicudo
et al. 2007) and reduction (average 37%) of phytoplankton species
(Crossetti et al. 2008). More recently, a 20-year study (1997-2017)
reported the invasion of the dinoflagellate Ceratium furcoides (Levander) Langhans
and the environmental variables that contributed to its establishment and
ecological success (Crossetti et al. 2019).
