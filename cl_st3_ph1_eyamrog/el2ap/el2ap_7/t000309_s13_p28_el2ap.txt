Our group considers patients with anorectal septic complications (i.e. perianal
abscess due to Crohnâ€™s disease), acute peritonitis, bowel obstruction, severe/toxic
colitis (toxic megacolon), and gastrointestinal hemorrhage who fail conservative treatment
are possible surgical candidates during the pandemic, but cases should
be analyzed on an individual basis. Advanced colorectal malignancy that
may progress to unresectable disease can also be considered for
surgery. When available, minimally invasive strategies such as percutaneous drainage
of an abscess may be a good strategy.
