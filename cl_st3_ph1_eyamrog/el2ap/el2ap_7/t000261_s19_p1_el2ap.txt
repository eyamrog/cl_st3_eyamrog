The water quality of Garças Reservoir varied throughout the study
period. During the first three years (1997-1999), the system maintained
eutrophic and supereutrophic states (TSI between 59.1 and 67.0 without
SD). From 2000 to 2011, Garças Reservoir was considered hypereutrophic
(TSI ≥ 67.0 without SD) and from 2011 until the
end of the study period (2017) it returned to a
supereutrophic state, except for 2013 (figure 2). From the year
2000 on, the influence of Secchi disk depth on the
index-wide behavior started to increase, having decreased again only during
the last three years (2015-2017) (figure 2).
