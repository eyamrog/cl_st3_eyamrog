Such long-term monitoring measures a lot of variables and can
hamper public understanding and management decision making. In order to
mitigate such an issue, trophic state indexes (TSI) have been
developed and improved since the 70s. Aiming at aquatic productivity
and eutrophication measurements, the TSIs compose truthful health information on
ecosystem. Particularly in São Paulo State, Lambarelli (2004) developed a
TSI that has been widely used and is based on
the classic Carlson’s TSI (Carlson 1977) with some updates considering
the tropical reservoir dynamics.
