The quantification of total tannins was completed by the methodology
proposed by Makkar & Becker (1993). A vanillin solution of
4% (w/v) in methanol was added to the extract. Then
1.5 mL of concentrated HCl (37%) was added. The absorbance
was read at 500 nm in a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV
mini - 1240). The result was determined by interpolating the
absorbance of the samples against a calibration curve constructed from
standards of catechin and expressed as mg catechin equivalents per
g extract.
