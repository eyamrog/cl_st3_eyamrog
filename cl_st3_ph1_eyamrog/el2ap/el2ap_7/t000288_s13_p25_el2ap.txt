Health professionals are facing new challenges in providing care to
their patients. Remote treatment via chat, video conversation, telemedicine, teledentistry
and other technologies have given rise to a new look
at the professional-patient relationship, opening doors to an untapped universe,
since most dentists do not use them as part of
their daily work.71It is estimated that by 2025 over 60%
of the population will be using mobile internet.72 Therefore, mobile
technologies, including phones, are great allies to community health even
in low and middle-income population.73â€“75 Individuals that still do not
have access to mobile services would also benefit due to
diminishing waiting lines in local health assistance, at the nearest
Primary Health Units.
