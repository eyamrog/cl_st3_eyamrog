The main goal at this moment is to ensure the
safety of patients and health care workers. Current recommendations are
based largely on expertsâ€™ opinions and may change rapidly as
the outbreak is expected to escalate over the next weeks.
A recent report from Wuhan, China, describes the outcomes of
34 patients that underwent elective surgical procedures during the COVID-19
incubation period in the early phase of the outbreak. All
patients developed COVID-19 pneumonia shortly after surgery, 15 (44.1%) patients
required admission to the intensive care unit and seven patients
(20.5%) died (31).
