This rapid living systematic review and network meta-analysis (if applicable)
protocol was prospectively registered in the PROSPERO ‘‘International Prospective Register
of Systematic Reviews’’ platform (CRD42020179818), and was developed following the
preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis protocols (PRISMA-P)
guidance (5). The final report will comply with the recommendations
of the PRISMA extension statement for reporting of systematic reviews
incorporating network meta- analyses (6). To conduct the rapid systematic
review, we will employ abbreviated systematic review methods. Compared with
the methods of a systematic review, we will not perform
independent screens of abstracts and we will not search grey
literature (7).
