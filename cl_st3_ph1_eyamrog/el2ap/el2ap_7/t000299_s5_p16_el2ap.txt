Considering the quality assessment of studies included, the results suggest
a good quality overall, since no one showed a high
risk of bias. However, the control group must be better
evaluated in future works, once three studies did not use
sterile water. Nevertheless, for our analyses of pacifiersâ€™ disinfection mode,
they were all appropriated once they tested different types of
methods.
