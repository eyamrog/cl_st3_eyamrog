In our outpatient clinic, the great majority of appointments were
rescheduled. Although a formal tele-health system was not available, medical
staff closely monitored patients with severe active disease that required
corticosteroids or were being treated with combination therapy via telephone
calls. At this moment, laboratory tests are strictly limited, and
the endoscopy unit has only been attending to urgent cases,
according to the recommendations in the guidelines (11). Therefore, whenever
deemed necessary, ileocolonoscopy was replaced by fecal calprotectin.
