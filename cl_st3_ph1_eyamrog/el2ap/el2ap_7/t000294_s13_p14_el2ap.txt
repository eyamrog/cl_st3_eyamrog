On the other hand, with the indication of mask use
for health professionals, there was a rush to pharmacies to
acquire these by the general population, which has generated a
shortage for health services, in the care of patients with
COVID-19. On April 2, 2020, the Ministry of Health of
Brazil began to recommend the use of masks made of
cotton, non-woven-textiles, among others, for the population in contact with
suspects at home and that needs to go out to
perform activities that may require contact with other people, so
that masks act as a mechanical barrier.24 However, attention must
be paid to the other preventive measures already recommended, such
as social distancing and keeping hands away from the eyes,
nose and mouth, in addition to proper hand hygiene. This
indication is justified by the fact that the tissue mask
can reduce the spread of the virus by asymptomatic or
pre-symptomatic people who may be transmitting the virus without knowing
it, but it does not protect the individual who is
using it, as it has no filtering capacity of microorganisms.
It should be noted that its use must be individual,
and cannot be shared, and that, in health services, fabric
masks should not be used under any circumstances, considering the
provisions of Technical Note 4/2020, of the Brazilian National Surveillance
Sanitary Agency (ANVISA – correspondent to US’ FDA).24
