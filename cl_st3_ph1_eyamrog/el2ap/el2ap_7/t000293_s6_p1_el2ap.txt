The results of the present study show that chest CT
has a good performance for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection
patients at a cancer center. We classified the results of
chest CT scans according to findings already described for the
interpretation of studies in patients with suspected COVID-19. We studied
two scenarios for the CT interpretation: in the first one,
we considered positive for COVID-19 only chest CT with typical
findings and, in the second one, we also considered positive
the CTs with findings described as indeterminate. This information can
be useful in a triage situation when CT scans are
avail- able but access to the RT-PCR test is limited,
the results are time consuming and there is a shortage
of hospital beds and isolation units. It is interesting to
note that the first scenario showed high specificity, which gives
confi- dence to select patients with positive results as those
who should benefit from investigative or intervention mea- sures, because
there will be few false-positive results. The second scenario showed
high sensitivity, which provides confidence to select patients with negative
CT results as those in which other investigative or intervention
mea- sures can be avoided or optimized, such as RT-PCR
test, isolation and hospitalization, because false negative CT results are
rare.
