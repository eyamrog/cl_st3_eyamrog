Sixteen algal classes had representatives documented for the PEFI area.
There are presently surveyed 869 taxa, including species, varieties, and
taxonomic formae. We believe that c. 95% of all taxa
occurring in the PEFI area was already inventoried. Chlorophyceae are
the richest group in terms of number of species. Addition
of the Radiococcaceae to the total number of taxa will
certainly be very small. Following, are the Zygnematophyceae with 167
taxa, whose survey is already concluded for the PEFI area.
In the third place, are the Bacillariophyceae with 115 taxa,
but this number for sure does not represent the participation
of this algal group in the total number of taxa
identified for the Park. Chlorophyceae includes a high number of
genera, however, just a few of them with a high
number of species. Zygnematophyceae do not include as many genera
as the Chlorophyceae, but two of them (Cosmarium and Staurastrum)
presented a high number of species in the Park, making
high the class total number of taxa. The Bacillariophyceae surely
includes the World largest number of taxa, and that considerable
species-rich groups are still to be surveyed.
