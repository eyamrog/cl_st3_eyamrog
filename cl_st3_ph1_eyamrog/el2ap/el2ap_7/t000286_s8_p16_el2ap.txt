The results show that there was a negative relationship between
the general economic situation index and the optimal macroeconomics uncertainty
index. Related with this discussion, Kalyoncu (2009) studied the sensitivity
of purchasing power parity, and its validity when using the
unit root test to examine data from Turkey and its
trading partners. He chose data from several countries, including the
United States, France, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Kalyoncu’s
results indicate a significant correlation between the validity of PPP
and trade level for each of the sample countries. In
terms of the literature focusing on the effect of foreign
exchange and tourism on GDP of Turkey, Arslantürk and Atan
(2012) analyzed the effect of foreign exchange and tourism on
the GDP of Turkey. The data was collected from 1987
to 2009. Co-integration and Granger causality models were used to
test the relationship between the two variables. The results of
their study showed a positive relationship between tourism income and
gross domestic product growth. Therefore, tourism income as economic growth
increased.
