(Garças Reservoir trophic state dynamics: a 20-year synthesis). The Garças
Reservoir history reveals a remarkable case of human impacts resulting
from the urbanization pressure over the 20th century. It is
a shallow tropical system located in the Parque Estadual das
Fontes do Ipiranga, a protected area within the city of
São Paulo, São Paulo State, Brazil. Based on a comprehensive
dataset (1997-2017), we evaluated the water quality temporal change using
a trophic state index (TSI); in addition, we also verified
whether the management procedures improved the water quality. Mechanical removal
of macrophytes (1999) triggered an abrupt change from eutrophic-supereutrophic to
the hypereutrophic state with feedback mechanisms. After five years (2005),
a slowdown in the internal P loading process occurred, followed
by the installation of the secondary wastewater treatment in the
city zoo two years later (2007). Both processes promoted the
beginning of water quality improvement. In 2011, TSI first dropped
to supereutrophic state with the temporary diversion of the sewage
effluent from the São Paulo State Department of Agriculture. This
effluent was finally inactivated (2014) and the system sustained the
supereutrophic state. TSI responded well to the historical key events
related to the control of sewage effluents. After 11 years
from the permanent impact of macrophytes removal, current results have
demonstrated improved health of the system. It is absolutely necessary
to improve the sewage treatment from the city zoo to
continue the reservoir recovery considering that since 2014 it has
been the only external phosphorous loading to Garças Reservoir. The
history of Garças Reservoir can offer a better understanding of
wrong management strategies and the vulnerability of tropical shallow systems
to eutrophication.
