After detecting critical changepoints in the data, we examined those
with an analysis that deals with fitting piecewise terms (segments)
in a regression model called piecewise (or segmented) regression. This
type of regression considers one or more break- points as
true parameters of the model and identifies potential time points
that show significant change. The potential break-points are identified in
the model due to a so-called “nuisance parameter”. As a
consequence, standard statistical tests do not apply (Muggeo 2008). In
other words, we cannot use the p-value returned through classical
tests. To mitigate this, we used the Davies test (Davies
1977) to verify significant differences between the slopes of each
segment. It is worth mentioning that the Davies test is
not aimed at obtaining the estimate of the break-point, it
tests for a non-zero difference-in-slope parameter of a segmented relationship.
For this purpose, we used segmented package (Muggeo 2008), also
in R program (R Core Team 2019).
