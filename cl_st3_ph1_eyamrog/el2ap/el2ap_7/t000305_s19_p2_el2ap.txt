The countries of group 5.1 (the USA, Spain, and the
UK) were selected for comparison with their peers (Mexico, Portugal,
and Ireland) and presented higher incidence and mortality rates among
the groups studied, with 154.835 cases per 100,000 inhabitants and
9.925 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. When comparing groups 5.1 and
5.2, it was observed that incidence, mortality, and lethality are
higher in group 5.1 than in group 5.2. presenting an
incidence of 8.01 times higher, mortality 14.73 times higher, and
lethality 1.84 times higher than group 6.2 (p < 0.001)
(Table 2).
