In order to find perceptive changepoints in this time-series, we
searched for significant mean and variance changes over the data.
This process can separate data in different segments in terms
of means and variance alterations, a changepoint is the observation
that separates different segments (Killick & Eckley 2014). This procedure
allowed to identify critical changes in the Gar√ßas Reservoir trophic
dynamics and was performed using the changepoint package (Killick &
Eckley 2014) and the PELT algorithm (Hinkley 1970), which enables
multiple changepoints detection. For this purpose, we used the R
program (R Core Team 2019).
