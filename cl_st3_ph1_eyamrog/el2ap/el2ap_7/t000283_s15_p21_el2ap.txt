Two authors (ACPNP and APR) will independently extract data. Discrepancies
or disagreements will be solved by a third author (CRRF).
We will use a predefined form to extract data from
included studies. The form will have information related to: -
the patients (demographic and clinical characteristics); - the pharmacological treatment
(name of the drug, treatment duration; dose); - time points
used for the assessments; - number of patients lost to
follow-up (in each group); - reasons for loss to follow-up;
- approach for handling missing data (data imputation/how data imputation
was performed, use of intention-to-treat approach); - sources of funding;
- possibility of conflict of interests; - adverse events; -
outcome measures; - protocol deviations. To assess the feasibility of
performing a meta-analysis, we will also extract the following data
for each primary and secondary outcome measure: - total number
of patients (in each group); - number of events in
each group (for dichotomous outcomes); - mean, standard deviation, standard
error, median, interquartile range, minimum, maximum, 95% confidence interval (CI)
(for continuous outcomes); - p-value .
