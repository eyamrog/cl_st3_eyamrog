A substantial body of evidence suggests that regular moderate to
vigorous physical activity (MVPA), defined as any bodily movement produced
by skeletal muscles that require energy expenditure10 performed at moderate
or vigorous intensities, is associated with a lower prevalence of
depressive11, 12 and anxiety symptoms12, 13 in the general population,
including low-middle income countries. Also, MVPA is linked to a
lower likelihood of incident depression and anxiety globally14, 15. On
the other hand, high levels of sedentary behavior (SB), defined
as any waking behaviour characterized by an energy expenditure â‰¤1.5
METs while in a sitting, reclining or lying posture16, are
associated with an increased risk of depressive17, 18 and anxiety
symptoms19.
