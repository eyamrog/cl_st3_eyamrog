As shown in other studies in the park (Struffaldi- De-Vuono
1985, Nastri et al. 1992, Knobel 1995, Gomes & Mantovani
2001, Tanus 2012), the community trees are small in relation
to others tropical forests, what is related to the dynamics
and growth of plants (Lieberman et al. 1990, Condit et
al. 1999). A large proportion of the specimens showed slow
growth (Mdn = 0.58% year-1, = 1.14% year-1), lower than
in another patch of the same park in recovery process
(Mdn = 0.72% year-1, x = 1.52% year-1, Gomes 1998).
There was no relative growth difference recorded between the size
classes, despite the tendency observed in some studies (Swaine et
al. 1987, Silva et al. 1995, Gomes et al. 2003).
Growth is related to the prevalence of a continuous canopy
and the predominance of small clearings in the area (Costa
& Mantovani 1992, Davinson 2009) with abundance of late-successional plants
and understory individuals, which generally have slower growth (Worbes 1989,
Welden et al. 1991, Felfilli 1995, Condit et al. 1999).
Lieberman and colleagues (1990) found that many plants had no
diameter growth over the course of 30 years in Neotropical
forests. Growth rates are quite variable; this is related to
the different environmental conditions as well as to the species’
and individuals’ life history and phenotypes (Swaine et al. 1987,
Worbes 1989, Sheil 1995a, Silva et al. 1995).
