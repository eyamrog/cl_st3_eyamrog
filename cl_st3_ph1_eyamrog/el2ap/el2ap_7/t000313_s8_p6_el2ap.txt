Changes in key amino acids (AA) related to an efficient
interaction between SARS-CoV-like S glycoprotein and ACE2 are crucial to
cross-species infection, multi-host infections, as well as differences in susceptibility
to disease and its symptoms in animal species. The evolutionary
phenomenon can be evoked to explain at least part of
these events and conditions. To contribute to a better understanding
of this complex process, we performed a comparative genomic analysis
of 70 ACE2 orthologues, representative of placental mammal species, including
pangolin, civet, bat, mink, and five New World monkey (NWm)
species (Parvorder Platyrrhini). Furthermore, we describe the genetic variation of
key binding sites across human populations. Our immediate goal is
to reveal the taxon-specific variability in ACE2 amino acid sequence,
its possible influence in cross-species SARS-CoV-2 infection, potential hosts, and
other related topics that can be important and very timely
considering the world outbreak of COVID-19.
