The present study found a high prevalence of depressive, anxiety,
and comorbid D&A symptoms in a sample of the Brazilian
population during COVID-19 pandemic. Although the average severity of depressive
and anxiety symptoms of the sample falls within the range
of mild symptoms, the prevalence of depressive symptoms is about
four times higher than those found in previous studies in
Brazil using similar screening tools25. Other studies also found high
prevalences of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the general population
during the COVID- 19 pandemics in Paraguay (depression=59.6%, anxiety=47.2%)26, Turkey
(moderate to severe depression=18.6%, moderate to severe anxiety=26.5%)27, China (depression=48.1%,
anxiety=22.6%, D&A=19.4%)8, and Basque region of Spain (depression=20.8%, anxiety=29.0%). Our
study is not representative of the general population and the
results should be interpreted taking the potential for self-selection bias
into account, also, we have used a screening tool that
is not able to diagnose depressive or anxiety disorders25 .
However, the high prevalence of symptoms found is suggestive that
the pandemic and the self-isolation are impacting mental health5, 6.
Accordingly, epidemiological studies to precisely estimate the real mental health
burden in the population are required. In the meanwhile, even
not being representative, and potentially overestimated, the findings indicate that
governing bodies should take initiatives to reduce the mental health
burden during periods that the general population is requested to
isolate themselves.
