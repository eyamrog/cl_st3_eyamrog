In other to test for the presence or absence of
unit root in the data used for the empirical analysis,
the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test was employed and the test
result is as presented in Table 2 above, it showed
that GD, INF and INT were stationary at level as
their ADF values (4.180454, 3.173179 and 5.591438) were greater than
0.05 critical value (3.02997, 2.991878 and 3.004861). These indicate that
three variables were stationary at level that is order, I
(0). While, FDI and EXC were stationary at First level
as their ADF Values (10.14302 and 3.996066) were greater than
0.05 critical value (2.998064 and 2.998064). Since the variables are
integrated at level and first level I therefore, proceed to
conduct co-integration test and short-run speed of adjustment from long-run
disequilibrium.
