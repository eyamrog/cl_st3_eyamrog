Thus, it is evident that in the areas near the
intervals around 21578, 29876, 29390, 3952, 11076 have high values.
As consulted in the database, this is positive because Gene
S, Gene N and ORF10 were identified. It is important
to research in more detail what happens around 11078 interval
(20 nt). It should be clarified that Gene: Orf1ab is
in the range [269, 21 558] (71% of the entire
genome) which is extremely wide and the 𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑥, 𝑟 indicates
something of importance around 11000
