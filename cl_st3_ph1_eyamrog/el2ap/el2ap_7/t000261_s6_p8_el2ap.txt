Summarizing, 11 years after the permanent impact of macrophytes removal
(1999), current results demonstrated an improvement in the system health.
The slowdown of the internal P loading process, in addition
to the secondary sewage treatment from the zoo city and
the sewage inactivation from the State Department of Agriculture, led
to the maintenance of the supereutrophic state. It is important
to emphasize that the secondary sewage treatment removes the biodegradable
organic matter (in solution or suspended) and suspended solids, however,
it does not remove dissolved nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen). Therefore,
in order to continue the reservoir recovery, it is absolutely
necessary to improve the sewage treatment from the city zoo,
considering that since 2014 it has been the only external
phosphorous loading to Gar√ßas Reservoir.
