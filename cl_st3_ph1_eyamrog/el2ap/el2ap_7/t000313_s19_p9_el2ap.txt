Finally, we also leveraged intra-specific variation of the ACE2 gene
using data from human populations available in the 1000 Genomes
Project (accessed through Ensembl and UNIPROT platforms). This dataset revealed
660 missense variants (all with minor allele frequency of 0.005
or less), 260 synonymous variants, 14,352 intron variants, 67 5’UTR
variants, and 268 3’UTR variants in the ACE2 gene in
humans. Many of these have been investigated in case-control or
genome-wide association studies for cardiovascular diseases and other correlated conditions
(see for instance Ji et al., 2017). Regarding the 30
ACE2 binding sites selected to present study (Figure 2), only
one of them, at position 26, has two alleles segregating
(K and R; Minor Allele Frequency or MAF = 0.002;
rs4646116). Although we do not have population data for the
other species investigated here, we observed that there is no
relevant polymorphism regarding the 30 sites that promote the interaction
between host-ACE2 and SARS-CoV-like viruses in the most studied species
of all (Homo sapiens). This finding reinforces the idea that
the AAs presented in Figure 2 are taxon- specific, i.e.,
characteristic of a species or a taxonomic group, where intra-specific
variation is absent or negligible. Also, the AA conservation within
Homo sapiens in these 30 sites indicates an instigating evolutionary
constraint whose reasons need to be further studied. A search
in the genome of the Neanderthal (Homo neanderthalensis) and in
the specimen of Denisova indicates that both present the same
AAs as Homo sapiens in these 30 sites.
