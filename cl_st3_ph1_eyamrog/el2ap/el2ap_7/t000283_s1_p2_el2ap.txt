METHODS: rapid living systematic review methodology with Network Meta- Analysis
following the recommendations of Cochrane Handbook. We will include randomized
controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-RCTs that evaluate single and/or combined
pharmacological interventions at any dose for the treatment of COVID-19.
We will search Medline via PubMed, Embase via Elsevier, Cochrane
Library - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Portal
Regional BVS - LILACS, Scopus and WebofScience to identify potentially
eligible studies. No language restrictions will be used in the
selection. We will perform the critical appraisal of included studies
with the Risk of Bias tool and the certainty of
evidence will be evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
Development and Evaluation (GRADE).
