To the best of our knowledge, this study is the
first large seroprevalence survey for SARS-CoV-2 infection among asymptomatic people
in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Although the survey was not
based on a random population sample, it does cover a
demographically and socially heterogeneous healthy population allowing a preliminary outlook
of the antibody prevalence in asymptomatic people. The prevalence estimates
provided by our study are corrected by the sensitivity and
specificity of the test employed and weighted by the population
age and sex structure, giving a better view of the
antibody prevalence at the population level.
