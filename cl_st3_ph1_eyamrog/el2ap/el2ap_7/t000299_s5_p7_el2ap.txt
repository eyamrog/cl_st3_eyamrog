Taking all of this into account, considering the variability of
the analysis, it is necessary to evaluate the disinfection method
that stands out in the regarding the advantages and that
can be easily reproduced by the population. Considering these characteristics,
the use of antimicrobial sprays in the daily routines interesting
because it is a practical and convenient alternative [13]. As
it is true, from the seven articles evaluated, five studied
the disinfection efficiency by using this method. The advantage of
a spray application is that it is quick and easy
to apply and provides a clean, fresh portion of the
solution each time it is used, while in the dipping
process, the solution becomes quickly contaminated and needs frequent replacement
[23]. Moreover, the efficiency of disinfection depends of the agent
used. There is no consensus for the better agent for
the spray uses.
