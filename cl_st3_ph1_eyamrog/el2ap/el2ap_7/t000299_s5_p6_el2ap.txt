Although many studies have described various decontamination protocols/agents, only a
few microorganisms have been tested. The fungi and the bacteria
analyzed were always from the same genus, Candida and Streptococcus,
respectively; both are microorganisms commonly found in the oral microbiota.
On the other hand, whether there was a consensus of
microorganisms, the microbiological analysis strategy was different: three studies used
Scanning Electron Microscopy â€“ SEM [3,10,15] and four used viable
count method [8,9,11,13]. SEM analysis is a suitable tool not
only for observing in detail the substrate morphology, but also
for monitoring bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation on a biotic
surface [21]. Viable count method is a sensible method for
analysis of live microorganisms [22], which has been used for
decades.
