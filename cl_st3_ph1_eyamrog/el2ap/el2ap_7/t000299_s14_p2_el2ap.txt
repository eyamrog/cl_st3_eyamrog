As search strategies, we conducted a survey in the databases
of MEDLINE/PubMed, Scientific Electronic Library (SciELO), Latin American and Caribbean
Health Sciences (LILACS), Web of Science and Scopus, that have
published scientific studies from recent studies 20 (twenty) years. The
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) descriptors used were "pacifier", "disinfection", "biofilm"
and "microbiology", and to perform the search, the term "pacifier"
was associated with the others, by using the Boolean operator
"AND". So, the equations were structured as follows: (pacifier and
disinfection); (pacifier and biofilm); (pacifier and microbiology).
