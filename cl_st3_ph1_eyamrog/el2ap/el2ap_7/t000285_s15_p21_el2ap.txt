We will employ the Cochran’s Q test to assess the
presence of heterogeneity considering a threshold of P value <
0.1 as an indicator of whether heterogeneity is present. In
addition, we will assess statistical heterogeneity by examining the Higgins
I2 statistic following these thresholds: < 25%: no (none) heterogeneity;
25% to 49%: low heterogeneity; 50% to 74%: moderate heterogeneity;
≥ 75%: high heterogeneity.
