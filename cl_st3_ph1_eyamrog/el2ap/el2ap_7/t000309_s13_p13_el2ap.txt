At our infusion center, the staff requested us to select
patients that could have their infusion postponed for 1 or
2 weeks in order to make more space available for
the rearrangement of seats. We used patients in deep clinical
and endoscopic remission at the last outpatient clinic assessment as
the main criteria for the rescheduling of infusions. In the
course of infusions, a distance of approximately 1.5 m between
seats was considered safe and no accompanying person was permitted.
Although we acknowledged that the use of surgical masks for
immunodeficient patients is indi- cated, it was not always available.
Thus, a screening protocol with an objective interview was implemented
prior to admission to systematically assess for acute respiratory tract
symptoms, such as cough, dyspnea, or fever, among both IBD
patients and their contacts. Asymptomatic patients recei- ved IV infusions
as planned, while those with highly sus- picious coronavirus infection
were referred to the emergency room. In cases where initiation
of biologics was extremely necessary, and when it was feasible,
preference for those biologics that could be offered subcutaneously, at
home, instead of intravenously, which would require an infusion center,
was recommended.
