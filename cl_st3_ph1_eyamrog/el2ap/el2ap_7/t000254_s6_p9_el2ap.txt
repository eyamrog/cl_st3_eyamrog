The observed dynamism seems to be associated with local conditions
and environmental resources. The park area has been protected since
1893 and the use of the sampled area has not
changed for at least 65 years (Peccinini & Pivello 2002).
Variations in water availability, temperature (Feeley et al. 2011), light
and mineral nutrients are correlated with changes in the dynamics
of plant communities (Laurance et al. 2009, Machado & Oliveira-Filho
2010).
