Digestive symptoms are reported in nearly half of the patients
with COVID-19. Diarrhea and fever may be present in addition
to respiratory symptoms (6). Since SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in
stool samples and other clinical specimens, awareness has been raised
regarding the manage- ment of patients with pre-existing digestive diseases,
such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Special attention was also
given to potential SARS-CoV-2 transmission via a fecal route (7,8).
Following viral infection, virus-specific RNA and proteins are synthesized in
the cytoplasm to assemble new virions. The detection of viral
RNA from feces 1 to 12 days after being negative
in respiratory samples suggest that the viruses are continuously secreted
from infected gastrointest- inal cells (9). The period of viral
secretion from pediatric feces is longer than in adults (10).
These observations suggest that the inflamed gut of adults and
children with IBD could be more susceptible to infection with
SARS-CoV-2 because it is a doorway for the virus (11,12).
