The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (denominated before as 2019-nCOV) is a
single-stranded RNA virus member of the Coronaviridae family. The estimates
of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) for the four
coronavirus genera of this family range from 10,000 to millions
of years (Wertheim et al., 2013). The most commented member
of the Coronaviridae family at the moment, SARS-CoV-2, has a
very recent origin. Based on genome sequence from different SARS-CoV-2
strains and a yearly mutation rate of 1.24 x 10-3
per site, Li et al. (2020a) estimated that it originated
on November 24 2019.
