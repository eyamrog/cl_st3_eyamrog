This study has some limitations related to the small sample
size and short follow-up. RT-PCR test, which was used as
gold-standard in this study, is believed to have high specificity
but sensitivity of 60â€“70% to diagnose SARS- CoV-2 infection(10,11). It
is known that RT-PCR has poten- tial vulnerabilities related to
preanalytical issues such as inadequate procedures for collection, handling, transport
and storage of the swabs, as well as analytical problems,
including testing outside the diagnostic window and other specific technical
issues(28). Prior studies demonstrated that COVID-19 patients may show very
early CT changes even before positive RT-PCR(11,29). Probably, the most
ef- ficient strategy for diagnosing COVID-19 in suspected patients should
combine clinical and epidemiologic suspi- cion with RT-PCR test and
chest CT findings, and repeat- ed RT-PCR should be collected
in patients with initially negative results and high clinical and
imaging likelihood of having COVID-19.
