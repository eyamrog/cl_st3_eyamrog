We plan to use the netmeta package version 1.2-1 implemented
in R-3.6.2 software for Mac to perform a network meta-analysis
and synthesize the direct and indirect evidence of the therapeutic
effect of the pharmacological therapeutic effects. We will use the
node splitting method to assess an inconsistency between direct and
indirect comparisons when there is a loop connecting three arms.
We will present the treatment ranking by P- scores based
on the points estimates and standard error of the available
network.
