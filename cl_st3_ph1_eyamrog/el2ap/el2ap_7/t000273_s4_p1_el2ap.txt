The important role that PHC has in facing the COVID-19
pandemic is notorious. Governments should spare no effort to strengthen
this component of the system, at risk of worsening the
health crisis, rapid collapse of the health system and an
increase in the number of deaths from both COVID-1913 and
other conditions sensitive to changes in PHC, including diarrheal disease,
respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Thus, PHC represents a strategic resource
in the limited arsenal of tools available to combat COVID-19.
