What we have observed, however, is that even though the
Ministry of Health reinforces the relevance of adopting such measures
on a daily basis, its compliance at first showed a
new learning for the population, above all, regarding the restriction
or social distancing, threatened in part by the risk of
increased unemployment, drop in income and/or often by minimizing the
potential risk of the pandemic. These behaviors could decrease effectiveness
of measures and increase the risk of resurgence of cases,25
as shown in Figure 2. Efforts by health and political
authorities in the states to encourage the population to stay
at home to achieve a flattening of the curve and
less circulation of the virus have been verified, as well
as review of some recommendations.
