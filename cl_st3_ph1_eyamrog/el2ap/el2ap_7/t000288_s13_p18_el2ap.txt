Due to the nature of the dental treatment, several procedures,
as the use of high-speed handpiece or ultrasonic scalers generates
aerosol (very small particles or droplets) that can be inhaled,
absorbed by the skin or set in nearby surfaces.62 According
to the last Scientific Brief published by the World Health
Organization,63 the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 can occur by respiratory
droplets from direct contact with an infected person (distance less
than 1m), indirect contact with contaminated surfaces or objects and
by aerosol produced during procedures performed on infected patients. Based
on that, dental and health organizations have issued recommendations to
postpone all elective dental treatments and non-essential procedures and limit
services only to urgent and emergency visits.10,11,12 Dental health care
personnel (DHCP) should be aware of the mechanisms of transmission,
the expanded infection control procedures, be able to identify patients
with signs / symptoms of COVID-19 and have a clear
understanding of what characterizes a dental emergency, urgent dental care
and non- emergency dental treatment.
