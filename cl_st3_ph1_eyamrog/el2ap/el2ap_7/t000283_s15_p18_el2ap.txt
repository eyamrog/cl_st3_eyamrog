We will search Medline via PubMed, Embase via Elsevier, Cochrane
Library - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Portal
Regional BVS - LILACS, Scopus and WebOfScience using relevant descriptors
and synonyms, adapting the search to the specifications of each
database to identify published, ongoing, and unpublished studies. We will
also search the following COVID-19 specific databases: Epistemonikos COVID- 19
LÂ·OVE platform; ClinicalTrials.gov; The World Health Organization International Clinical Trials
Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP). Finally, we will use the technique
of snowballing, searching the lists of references of the included
studies. No language restrictions will be used in the selection.
