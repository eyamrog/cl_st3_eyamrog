The lower numbers of cases and deaths by COVID-19 in
countries that have a vaccination program in place is instigating
and biologically plausible. So far, with the numbers of the
pandemic in progress, a correlation between the coverage of such
programs and the number of cases and deaths in the
countries studied has been found. The new data collection and
analysis will be essential to establish or refute this concept.
Controlled studies with easy-to-use methodologies should be quickly encouraged and,
until a specific vaccine is developed, this may be our
primary weapon.
