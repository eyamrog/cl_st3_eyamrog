The PEFI is considered the third-largest state park in the
SÃ£o Paulo Metropolitan Region, but it is the largest in
the metropolis whose surroundings are completely urbanized and which contains
remnants of the Atlantic Rain Forest (SMA 2008). The forest
remnants occupy approximately 70% of its 495 hectares, according to
the current limit (CONDEPHAAT 2018), and its predominant vegetation is
classified as regeneration of the Dense Montane Ombrophylous Forest in
different successional stages (Barros et al. 2002). The remnant is
a secondary and disturbed forest, in a long recovery process
(Peccinini & Pivello 2002). The area was occupied by 12
lots of farmers and ranchers and its expropriation began in
1893. Since it is isolated in one of the largest
metropolitan regions in the world it is subject to disturbances
such as edge effect, biological invasion, pollution, fires and heat
island effect (Struffaldi-De-Vuono 1985, Gomes et al. 2003, SMA 2008).
