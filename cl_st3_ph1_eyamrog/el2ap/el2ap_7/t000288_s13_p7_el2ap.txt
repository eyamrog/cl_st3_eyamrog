Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs primarily between family members, including
relatives and friends who have more intimate contact with infected
or asymptomatic patients or carriers. As an emerging acute respiratory
infectious disease, COVID-19 spreads mainly through the respiratory tract pathways
through droplets, respiratory secretions and direct contact even at a
low infectious dose. Likewise, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in swabs
from fecal and blood samples has been identified, indicating the
possibility of multiple routes of infection.18
