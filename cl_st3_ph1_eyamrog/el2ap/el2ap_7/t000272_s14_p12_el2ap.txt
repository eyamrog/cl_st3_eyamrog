Each sample was analyzed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)
for quantification of gallic acid. The analysis followed the method
described by Schieber et al. (2001). The chromatographic test was
conducted on Shimatzu (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) equipment with a
diode array detector (model SPD-M10A) in a C-18 column (Phenomenex
Gemine - 4.6 mm x 250 mm x i.d. 3
µm) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The analysis
was conducted using a wavelength of 272 nm. The column
was operated at a temperature of 30 °C. The mobile
phase used was 1% formic acid: methanol - 90:10 (v/v).
The sample injection volume was 10 µL.
