Table 2 above showed the empirical results from the Johansen
co-integration analysis. The Johansenâ€™s check is geared toward crucial check
whether or not a long relationship exists between the series,
and starting with the null hypothesis that there is no
co-integrating relation tested that there is at least one co-integrating
equation. Since there are five variables in the model, we
then test whether the number of co-integrating equations is zero,
one, two, three, four or five.
