However, in a considerable part of places far from large
centers in Brazil, the aprons available at the institutions are
made of fabric, not disposable. In these cases, however, at
this time of the pandemic, it is necessary that after
use, it is sent immediately to the laundry, and its
reuse is not recommended during new appointments. Contamination risk and
spread may increase in the case of apron reuse, increasing
the demand for beds destined to more serious cases and
even removal of health professionals due to their contamination. As
for the use of procedure gloves, they must also be
discarded before professionals leave the isolation room of patients. In
addition, long-barreled rubber glove use should be implemented for support
personnel, such as cleaning professionals.23 Care and attention of all
professionals is essential for the premise that glove use does
not replace hand hygiene and that the areas around patients,
infected or not, such as tables and bedside rails, are
considered contaminated. The areas should not be touched with gloves,
in order not to favor spread of the virus in
the environment. Thus, glove use inappropriately, especially in isolation sites
with more than one patient with COVID-19, may cause cross-contamination
among patients, favoring increased morbidity.
