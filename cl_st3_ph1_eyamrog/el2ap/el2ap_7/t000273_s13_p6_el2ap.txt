With a resolution rate of around 85% of the population’s
basic health needs, PHC was responsible, between the years 2001
and 2016, for reducing 45% of hospitalizations for conditions sensitive
to this level of care (76% in hospitalizations for asthma,
66.5% in hospitalizations for gastroenteritis and 57.3% of hospitalizations for
cardio and cerebrovascular diseases, for example).7 In municipalities with Mais
Médicos (More Doctors) program, the reduction in these admissions was
4% greater than in those without the program.9
