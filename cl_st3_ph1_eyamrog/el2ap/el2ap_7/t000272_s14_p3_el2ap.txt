The EE was subjected to liquid-liquid partition. Then the EE
was solubilized in a solvent system of ethanol:water (80:20, v/v)
in a 1:1 (v/v). EE solution was put in a
separatory funnel and the solvents [hexane - Hex, chloroform –
Chlo, and ethyl acetate – EtAc - (Merck - Darmstadt,
Hessen, Germany)] were sequentially added in a 1:1 (v/v) and
stirred. The funnel was allowed to stand for about 10
minutes so that there was phase separation. The process was
repeated three times for each solvent to reach the appropriate
amount of each fraction. Subsequently, each fraction was concentrated in
a vacuum rotary evaporator (40 °C, 55 rpm) until complete
solvent removal was achieved.
