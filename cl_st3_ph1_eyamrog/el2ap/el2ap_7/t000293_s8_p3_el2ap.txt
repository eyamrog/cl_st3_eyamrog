Cancer patients appear to have a higher risk of de-
veloping COVID-19 as well as a worse prognosis of the
disease when compared to non-cancer patients(20). CT findings could be
associated with a higher risk of devel- oping severe events
in cancer patients(21). These patients are also at increased risk
for the development of other pulmonary complications related to the
disease itself or its treatment, such as opportunistic infections, thrombo-
embolism, drug toxicity, actinic pneumonitis, among oth- ers(22,23). These complications
may represent differential diagnoses or be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection
in cancer patients.
