Results: the World Health Organization has pointed out that the
path to reduce the speed of circulation of the virus,
control and decrease in the number of cases and deaths
resulting from this pandemic can only be accomplished with mass
adoption of fundamental measures that include hand hygiene, alcohol gel
use, cough etiquette, cleaning surfaces, avoiding agglomerations and social distancing.
The epidemiological curve of the disease clearly shows the devastating
proportions in Italy, Spain and the United States, surpassing China
in death records, due to the delay in adopting the
aforementioned measures. In Brazil, the rapid progression in relation to
the world and Latin America points to an important increase
in the number of cases.
