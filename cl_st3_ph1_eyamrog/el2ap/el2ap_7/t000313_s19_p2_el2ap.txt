After that first evolutionary analysis, we examined all variable sites
found considering the 70 orthologues. However, we choose only the
30 variable sites with information that they are functional and/or
involved in the interaction between host-ACE2 and SARS-CoV-like viruses (Towler
et al., 2004; Li et al., 2005a, 2020; Luan et
al., 2020; Wan et al., 2020). Figure 2 shows the
AAs observed in 30 chosen variable sites across the ACE2
orthologues of 70 selected placental mammal species. Three of them
(24, 34, and 559) are target sites for positive selection,
according to BEB (Table S3). The topology of Figure 2
recovers the phylogenetic relationship between the major taxonomic groups investigated.
For example, Homo sapiens and all other great apes (family
Hominoidea) share the same amino acids in the 30 positions,
and only one divergence from Cercopithecidae species at the positive
selection site 559 (conservative AA change, R559K; GS = 26)
(Figure 2).
