Garças Reservoir history reveals a remarkable case of human impacts
resulting from the urbanization pressure over the 20th century. It
is an urban system located in the Parque Estadual das
Fontes do Ipiranga preservation area, surrounded by the São Paulo
Metropolitan Region. It was originated from a former water supply
reservoir built in 1894 to meet the city increasing demand
for drinking water and was used for this purpose until
1928. Costa- Böddeker et al. (2012) provided the eutrophication history
of the reservoir during c. 110 years based on a
paleolimnological study and land-use records (1894 to 2005). According to
Costa-Böddeker et al. (2012), the reservoir experienced a deep decline
in its water quality triggered by untreated sewage loads from
the city zoo and further source of untreated domestic effluent
from the São Paulo State Department of Agriculture.
