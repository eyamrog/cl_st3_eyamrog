Within the literature that focuses on FDI inflows and exchange
rate, Cushman (1985) analyzed the relationship between FDI inflows, rate
of risk, and exchange rate regime. In order to minimize
the effect of inflationary trends as estimates, Cushman used the
real exchange rate instead of the nominal exchange rate. The
findings from the U.S. annual data show that risk would
significantly increase when there is a steady decrease in FDI
inflows. This finding is also valid and significant for the
Turkish case. The strong decline in FDI inflows in 2009
increased the risk factor on real exchange rate in Turkey.
