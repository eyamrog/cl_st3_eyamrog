Even considering such limitations, it is possible to infer that
protective levels of natural herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 under the
social distancing policies implemented in Rio de Janeiro is far
from being built, and should not be considered a target
to inform a short-term exit plan. Therefore, the timing for
relaxing social distancing strategies in the short-term should rely mostly
on the availability of adequate health care infrastructure, until a
larger and population-based serological survey could be done. Such a
survey should be designed to identify variations in the level
of herd immunity within the state and eventually recommend a
more-locally oriented strategy based on the levels of natural herd
immunity, degree of vulnerability of the population and the availability
of adequate resources for testing and treating the severe cases
of COVID-19.
