Viruses are complex pathogens with a high capacity to infect
multiple host species, causing a variety of diseases with numerous
symptoms. CoVs are pleomorphic RNA-viruses (subgenus sarbecovirus, subfamily Orthocoronavirinae) characterized
by high speed of gene recombination due to constant errors
in their RNA polymerase-dependent replication process (RdRP).18,20 The main steps
involved in the replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2 are: recognition and
binding to the host cell via membrane fusion or endocytosis
mechanism. After the invasion, the viral genome is released; then
occurs translation of the viral polymerase protein; RNA replication; sub-
genomic transcription; translation of viral structural proteins; viral structural proteins
combination with the nucleocapsid; formation of mature virions and finally
the release of mature virions by exocytosis. At the end
of the cycle, newly mature virions are released and may
infect new targets and the cycle repeats itself continuously.15 During
their replication cycle, two-thirds of the viral RNA encode 16
non-structural proteins (NSPs). The other one-third of the virus genome
encodes four essential structural proteins, including: spike glycoprotein (S), small
envelope protein (E), matrix protein (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N),
and also other accessory proteins.18,21
