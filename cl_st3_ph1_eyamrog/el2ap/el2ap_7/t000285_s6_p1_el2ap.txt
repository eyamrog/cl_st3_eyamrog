The clinical presentation, severity and prognostic of a co-infection related
to the SARS- CoV-2 and an Arboviral infection have not
been well established yet. However, it is already known that
a syndemic scenario would be an additional challenge and burden
for the healthcare and economic systems of endemic countries for
arboviral diseases (4). In our view, finding reliable evidence for
the development of actions to fight COVID-19 situation is an
important and urgent strategic objective. Thus, this rapid living review
will systematically assess the best available evidence to respond to
this scenario and to provide reliable information for decision-makers.
