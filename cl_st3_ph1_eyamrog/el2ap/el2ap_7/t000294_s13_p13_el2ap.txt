To remove the mask, the side elastics must first be
removed, and the inner surface must not be touched. After
removal, the mask must be packed in a paper bag
or envelope with the elastics out, to facilitate the removal
of the mask for new use. Plastic bag use, however,
may contribute to the mask remaining moist and potentially contaminated.
Another aspect to be highlighted is about its cleaning, after
use, these cannot be cleaned or disinfected for later use
and when wet they lose their filtration capacity.23
