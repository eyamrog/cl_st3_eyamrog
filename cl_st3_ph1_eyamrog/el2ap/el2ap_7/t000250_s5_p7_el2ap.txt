The present study has some limitations. First, the cross-sectional design
does not allow to draw any directionality in the relationship.
Further longitudinal data can further clarify the potential protective effects
of MVPA against the development of depression and anxiety during
the self-isolation. Second, the sample was mostly composed of females
and young adults recruited by social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter,
and emails sent to a network of researchers. Although there
is data of participants from 24 of the 27 Brazilian
states, about 62% of participants are from Rio Grande do
Sul, 14.8% from Rio de Janeiro, and 6.5% from Cear√°
states. Therefore, the representativeness of this sample is limited. Third,
we could not rule out a sampling bias as those
who are experiencing more depressive and anxiety symptoms might be
more interested in participating in the study (self-selection bias), causing
an exaggerated prevalence. Fourth, all data was collected using a
self-report online survey. Self-reported data can suffer from recall bias,
as well as, by social desirability. Last, we could not
explore whether PA was performed during leisure-time or in other
domains. Further studies should evaluate the role of the different
domains that PA is performed in the associations between MVPA
and depressive and anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic.
