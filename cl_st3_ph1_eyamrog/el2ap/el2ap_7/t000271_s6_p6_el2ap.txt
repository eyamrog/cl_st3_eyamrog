In this sense, it is reassuring that our results match
some basic premises. First, the increasing seroprevalence across time was
something expected, since the epidemic curve is on the rise
for the last two months in Rio de Janeiro, without
any clear sign of reduction [21]. Also, the higher prevalence
among the youngest was predictable, because they are the core
of the workforce and are more likely to circulate and
thus being exposed to infection, even under the social distancing
restrictions. The higher prevalence of infection among those with less
formal education is also expected since those at the lower
socioeconomic stratum are probably those who have the most difficulties
in following the social distancing recommendation since they have to
look for some source of income. In addition, many of
them live in crowded households without access to piped water,
which makes it difficult to adopt basic hygiene measures. A
study in the State of Ceará indicated that subjects with
primary education considered themselves at a lower risk for getting
COVID-19 and were less engaged in voluntary quarantine as compared
to those with a higher level of education [25]. Finally,
it was also anticipated that blood donors from “condos” should
have lower prevalence, since they are donating blood where they
live and are probably at home following the social distancing
recommendations. Contrarily, those who donate blood at the Hemorio are
more likely to do so while coming to the city
center for working or other reasons.
