It is also known that viruses that take advantage of
receptors with conserved AA sequence have a broad host range
(Woolhouse et al., 2012). It is worth recalling that ACE2
has conserved the AA sequence in crucial binding sites within
Homo sapiens, but not between placental mammal species investigated here.
In other words, the high mutation rate SARS-CoV-2 may provide
alternatives to infect one of several species, but when a
high tropism with the host cell is found, it can
be predicted that the binding region has little (if any)
variation within the target species.
