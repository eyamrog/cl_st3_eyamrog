A study that evaluated the case isolation effectiveness concerning COVID-19
control showed that isolation may be sufficient for its control
over a period of three months, having been more effective
when there was low transmission, before the onset of symptoms.21
However, isolation, without adequate preventive measures, may be considered insufficient
to control the outbreak. Thus, society/community, at this moment, is
alerted to the importance of correct hand hygiene technique, mask
use and surface hygiene measures that jointly prevent spread of
the virus.8,22
