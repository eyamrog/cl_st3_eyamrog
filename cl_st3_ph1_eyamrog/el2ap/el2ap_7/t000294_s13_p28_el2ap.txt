Japan carried out a rigorous surveillance between the time from
the onset of the disease in a primary (suspected) case
to its manifestation in a secondary (infected) case to understand
the transmissibility of the disease.30-31 With the mapping of suspect/infected
data, it was initially possible to control spread and transmissibility
from substantial pre-symptomatic transmissions and early isolation of people with
COVID-19 in a population of 120 million. As a result,
as of April 18, 2020, cases reached 10,300, with a
total of 222 deaths.26
