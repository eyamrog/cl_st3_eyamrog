In most countries, cases of dental emergency or urgent dental
care on patients without any signs and symptoms of COVID-19
can be treated at the dental office. However, since there
is a large number of asymptomatic cases of Covid-19,47 the
dentist should take extra precautions when seeing the patient and
not assume he/she is COVID-19 free. Besides the asymptomatic patients,
dental practitioners should be aware that children represent a significant
transmission risk to the virus since they present milder symptoms
than adults.69 It is important to maintain patient isolation (have
only one patient in the waiting room), adhere to the
infection control protocol: standard procedure of putting on and removing
all Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), including gown, goggles, N95 mask
with face full shield and gloves.64 Before every treatment, patient
should use a mouth rinse with 1% or 1.5% hydrogen
peroxide or 0.2% povidone 9,64 and should wear goggles and
bib during the whole procedure. To minimize the aerosol production,
dentists should use hand instrumentation, high-volume saliva ejector and dental
dam during the treatment and refrain to use 3-in-1 syringe.61
