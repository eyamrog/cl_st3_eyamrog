Species of the Coronaviridae family can infect a wide variety
of animals and humans, causing severe respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and
neurological diseases (Weiss and Leibowitz, 2011). In humans, coronavirus has
caused mainly respiratory tract infections and, for decades, were considered
with little clinical and epidemiological importance until SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
outbreaks (Kuiken et al., 2003; Zaki et al. 2012). Today,
SARS-Cov-2 is responsible for the COVID-19, a pandemic that has
challenged governments and peoples of every country in the world.
COVID-19 already killed more persons than diseases caused by SARS-CoV
and MERS-CoV combined, emphasizing the importance of this pathology as
a highly relevant public health concern (WHO; https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019).
