The consensus phylogeny of species, based on neutral molecular markers,
was obtained from the Timetree server (www.timetree.org; Kumar et al.,
2017). This phylogeny is used as a reference by specialized
literature following Meredith et al. (2011). To better understand evolutionary
patterns that are acting on ACE2, we performed a Site
Model (NsSite) test with Codeml package in PAML 4.9 software
(Yang, 2007), which allows for inter-specific phylogenetic comparison of substitution
rates in protein-coding genes. This test allows for ω variation
(ω = dN/dS, being dN the rate of non- synonymous
substitutions and dS the rate of synonymous substitutions) across sites.
It fits neutral (ω≅1), selective constraint (ω< 1), or positive
selection (ω>1) models to the observed levels of variation. To
determine which evolutionary model best fit the analyzed data, we
performed Likelihood Ratio Tests (Yang, 1998). For these, we compared
the neutral model (M1) against the model that allows positive
selection (M2a) with df = 2 (Yang, 2007). Bayes Empirical
Bayes (BEB) was used to infer sites with a high
probability of being under positive selection (Yang et al., 2005).
Furthermore, we classify amino acid variation found in placental mammals
ACE2 coding sequences into four classes of chemical similarity accordingly
Grantham score (Grantham, 1974): conservative (GS = ≤50), moderately conservative
(GS = 51–100), moderately radical (GS = 101–150), and radical
(≥151).
