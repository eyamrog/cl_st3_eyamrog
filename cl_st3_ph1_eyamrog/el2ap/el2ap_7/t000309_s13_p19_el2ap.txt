To date, there are no formal evidence-based recommenda- tions from
clinical societies or governments for immunosup- pressed patients, like those

patients based mainly on expert opinions and must be interpreted
in a patient- specific context. These recommendations can be modified
and updated as new evidence emerges (14,20).
