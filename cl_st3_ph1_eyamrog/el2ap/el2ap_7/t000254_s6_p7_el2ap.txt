The death of large specimens caused by some disturbance in
the past, as noted in other areas of the park
(Struffaldi-De-Vuono 1985, Gomes & Mantovani 2001, Peccinini & Pivello 2002,
Gomes et al. 2003) may have facilitated light reaching the
lower layer of the forest and promoted higher turnover of
smaller plants, influencing the establishment of climbers, mainly the woody
climbers (lianas). The maintenance of lianas depends on the availability
of large trees in the forest (Engel et al. 1998,
Phillips et al. 2005, Sfair et al. 2013).
