Plant Dynamics - Concerning the shrub-tree versus climbers dynamics, the
annual mortality of climbers was greater than that of plants
in the shrub-tree synusia in both classes, < 2.5 cm
dbh (Mann-Whitney Test, U = 7, p = 0.0004) and
> 2.5 cm dbh (Mann-Whitney Test, U = 16; p
= 0.009; figure 3 and table 4).
