In Brazil, before donating blood, candidates should fill in a
written questionnaire and go through a brief medical screening. To
be accepted as blood donors in Hemorio, candidates should comply
with the Brazilian Ministry of Health and American Association of
Blood Banks criteria for donor eligibility [18]. Among these, some
have been recently included, all of them related to COVID-19:
prospective donors could not have had flu-like symptoms in the
30 days prior to donation; they must not have had
close contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases in the
30 days before donation; they must not have traveled abroad
in the last 30 days. Candidates with fever â€“ forehead
temperature >37.8oC - on the day of donation are also
refused. Therefore, everyone accepted to donate blood had no symptoms
of COVID-19 and no known epidemiological history of the disease.
