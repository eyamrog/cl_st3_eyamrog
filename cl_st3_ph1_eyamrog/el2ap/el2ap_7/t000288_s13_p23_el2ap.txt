In a specific situation where the patient has an unavoidable
emergency and no signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and the
dentist does not have a N95 mask or higher level,
he/she must wear surgical mask in a single use, goggles
and face shield to treat a patient, but be aware
that the risk of contamination will be moderate.64 There is
a limitation in following this procedure since there is current
community spread of COVID-19 with asymptomatic cases in the population.
Current research shows that the prognosis of patients with COVID-19
is worst for those older than 60 years of age
or presenting underlying diseases (diabetes, hypertension or cardiovascular disease, for
example).70 In this sense, members of the health team must
use clinical judgment and take all precautions to prevent transmission.
