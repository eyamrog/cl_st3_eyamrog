Hosts and pathogens are always in an evolutionary arms race.
Several investigations reveal that coronavirus evolved to recognize different host-receptors,
while others explain the hostâ€™s strategies to defend themselves. For
example, Peng et al. (2017) showed that a hepatitis coronavirus
(MHV) infection drives the evolution of a mouse receptor (mCEACAM1a).
In this case, this event represented an answer to the
intense selective pressure from a lethal infection where MHV uses
mCEACAM1a as its host-receptor and changes in critical amino acid
residues have led to the emergence of a derived-allele (mCEACAM1b)
that is much more deficient as MHV receptor (Peng et
al., 2017). Consequently, mice that are homozygous for this derived-allele
are highly resistant to death from MHV infections (Peng et
al., 2017).
