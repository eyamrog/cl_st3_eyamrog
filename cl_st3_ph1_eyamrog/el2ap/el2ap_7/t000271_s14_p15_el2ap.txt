To establish the correlates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we used logistic
regression models and the odds ratio (OR) as the measure
of association. Statistical tests at the 5% significance level were
used to test associations of SARS-Cov-2 antibody (IgG, IgM or
IgG+IgM) prevalences with the blood donorsâ€™ characteristics (sex, age group,
educational level, place of residence, donation site and period of
donation). Statistical analysis was performed using STATA version 13 (STATA
Corp., College Station, Texas, USA).
