Time spent in MVPA was assessed by two questions: 1)
“How much time on an average day have you spent
in vigorous physical activity since self-isolating?”; and 2) “How much
time on an average day have you spent in moderate
physical activity since self-isolating?”. The questions were accompanied by the
following explanations: “Think about all the vigorous and moderate activities
that you do on average daily during self-isolating. Vigorous physical
activities refer to activities that take hard physical effort and
make you breathe much harder than normal. Moderate activities refer
to activities that take moderate physical effort and make you
breathe somewhat harder than normal”. For the logistic models, MVPA,
moderate physical activity (MPA), and vigorous physical activity (VPA) when
self-isolating were treated as dichotomous variables. MVPA and MPA were
dichotomized into 1 = <30 minutes per day, or 2
= ≥30 minutes per day. VPA was dichotomized into 1
= <15 minutes per day, or 2 = ≥15 minutes
of VPA per day). These cut-offs were chosen to be
in line with the public health recommendations of 150 minutes
of MVPA, or 75 minutes of VPA per week22.
