This study is a protocol to describe the rationale, hypothesis
and planned methods of our systematic review. It was submitted
for registration in the PROSPERO ‘‘International Prospective Register of Systematic
Reviews’’ platform. Considering the scenario of need for instant evidence
to respond to COVID-19 pandemic, we will perform a rapid
living systematic review, abbreviating the method by running screens of
titles and abstracts through one author. In addition, this study
will adopt a living method, continually updating and incorporating new
clinical trial registrations and relevant data as they become available
This systematic process will follow the recommendations proposed by the
Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (5).
