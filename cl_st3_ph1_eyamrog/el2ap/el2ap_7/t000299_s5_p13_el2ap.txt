The chlorhexidine solution (0.12%) is proposed to be used in
various ways [28] and purposes, including toothbrushes disinfection [29]. It
also has been shown to be effective in eliminating pacifier
microorganisms [3,9-11]. However, its use is controversial, mainly especially due
to the cost when compared to other disinfection solutions. These
disadvantages may limit their widespread use, especially in low-income populations
[8,25].
