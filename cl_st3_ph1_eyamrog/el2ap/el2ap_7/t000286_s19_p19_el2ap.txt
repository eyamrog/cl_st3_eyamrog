The results revealed that EXC does not granger causes GD;
the null hypothesis is accepted at 5% significance level, indicated
by the high probability value 0.0124. The results also revealed
that GD does not granger causes EXC, the null hypothesis
is accepted at 5% percent indicated by the probability value
0.0709 and this is confirmed by the F-statistics value 5.66235.
This result therefore indicates one-way causation flowing from EXC to
GD.
