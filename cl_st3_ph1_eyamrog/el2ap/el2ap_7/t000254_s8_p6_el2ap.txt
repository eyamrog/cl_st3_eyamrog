Differentiated dynamics are also expected in relation to successional groups
from rainforest (Budowski 1965, Swaine et al. 1987, Whitmore 1989,
Gomes et al. 2003, Schorn & Galv√£o 2009) such as
the PEFI forest, which constitute a mosaic of secondary areas
at different successional stages (Nastri 1992, Struffaldi-De-Vuono 1985, Costa &
Mantovani 1992, Gomes & Mantovani 2001, Pivello & Peccinini 2002,
Gomes et al. 2003). Thus, additionally, we present the status
of successional groups, for which we expect differences between mortality
and recruitment of early and late-successional plants.
