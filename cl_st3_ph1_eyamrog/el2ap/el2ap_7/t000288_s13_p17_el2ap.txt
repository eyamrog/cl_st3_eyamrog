Dentists should receive and make great efforts regarding preventive care
and testing, as they can seriously affect the flattening of
the epidemic curve, avoiding the collapse of the health system.
Several modeling studies and scenario comparisons - both related to
the current pandemic situation and those already experienced especially in
China and Italy - have shown that combined interventions must
be implemented, both for the population and for health professionals.
General measures for all health professionals including dentists comprise daily
monitoring of the temperature and testing the health care provider
team; use of N95 masks; distance from the workplace (when
possible) with the implementation of network communication technologies with patients;
social distance; mobility restriction measures; avoid crowd places; diagnostic tests
and isolation of infected individuals as well as their families.55â€“60
Especially for dentists it is necessary to follow guidance protocols
and new tools/technologies for dental practice aimed at safeguarding oral
health professionals, as well as the population under their care.59,61
