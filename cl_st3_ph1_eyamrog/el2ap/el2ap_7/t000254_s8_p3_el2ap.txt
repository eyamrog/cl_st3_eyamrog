Subject to numerous disturbances, such as fragmentation, isolation, biological invasion,
fires, pollution, edge effect and heat island (Struffaldi-De- Vuono 1985,
Gomes et al. 2003, SMA 2008), the PEFI is an
important laboratory for the study of forest dynamics, besides the
significant climate changes seen over the past 85 years (EM-IAG
2017). Studies on the plant communities in different parts of
PEFI showed heterogeneous vegetation cover with patches of heavily impacted
forest (Struffaldi-De-Vuono 1985, Costa & Mantovani 1992, Gomes & Mantovani
2001, Pivello & Peccinini 2002, Gomes et al. 2003, Davison
2009, Eisenlohr et al. 2009, Hirata et al. 2010, Villagra
& Romaniuc-Neto 2011, Tanus et al. 2012), some in evident
recovery process and some relatively little disturbed (Pivello & Peccinini
2002, Gomes et al. 2003).
