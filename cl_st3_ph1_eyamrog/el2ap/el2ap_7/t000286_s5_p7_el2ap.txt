The Durbin-Watson statistics of 2.578326 suggest evidence of negative serial
autocorrelation. The unit root test revealed that the three variables
(GD, INF and INT ) of the model indicate that
three variableswere stationary at level, that is order, I (0)
which is indicated by ADF results (4.180454, 3.173179 and 5.591438)
which were greater than 0.05 critical value (3.02997, 2.991878 and
3.004861). While, FDI and EXC were stationary at First level
as their ADF Values (10.14302 and 3.996066) were greater than
0.05 critical value (2.998064 and 2.998064).
