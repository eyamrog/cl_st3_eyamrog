Assessing the prevalence trends of viral infections among blood donors
is not only essential to estimate the effectiveness of blood
safety strategies, but also to improve current strategies to increase
transfusion safety, minimizing the potential risk of Coronavirus virus by
blood transfusion [15]. Besides, determining the SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in blood
donors can be a way of monitoring the circulation of
the virus in healthy people, thus helping to implement strategies
to minimize the risk of transmission, especially in the absence
of seroprevalence surveys. Nevertheless, there exist few studies on the
prevalence among blood donors. Two yet unpublished studies found seroprevalence
among blood donors of 1.7% and 2.7% in Denmark and
the Netherlands, respectively [16, 17].
