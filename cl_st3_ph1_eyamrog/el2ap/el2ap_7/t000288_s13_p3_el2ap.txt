The genomic sequence of the new viral Coronavirus was immediately
defined by public health support and online community resources “virological.org”
on January 10th (Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank accession number MN908947)16 followed by
four other deposited genomes on January 12th in the database
of viral genomic sequences maintained by the Global Initiative on
Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID).17 The clinical signs and symptoms
in the beginning suggested the presence of a virus closely
related to SARS outbreak in 2002/2003. This species also comprised
a large number of viruses detected in rhinolophid bats in
Asia and Europe. 17 After sequencing, the SARS-CoV-2 genome was
found to be 96.2% identical to the Bat RaTG13 coV,
while sharing 79.5% identity with the SARS-CoV. In this way,
the similarity between the genomes of the viruses shows that
the bat is the natural host of the virus and
SARSCoV-2 may have been transmitted to humans, in an unknown
way, through intermediate hosts. Several studies suggest that the bat
is the potential reservoir of SARS-CoV-2. However, there is evidence
that the origin of SARS-CoV-2 was the seafood market in
Wuhan, China.18 Coronaviruses (CoV) α- and β-CoV are capable of
infecting mammals, while γ- and δ-CoV tend to infect birds.
Although the six CoVs identified as human-susceptible viruses, presented low
pathogenicity, causing mild respiratory symptoms similar to a common cold;
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may lead to severe and potentially fatal
respiratory tract infections.18,19
