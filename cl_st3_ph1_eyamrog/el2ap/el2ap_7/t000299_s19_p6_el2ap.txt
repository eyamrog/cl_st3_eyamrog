- Boiling water during 15 minutes: Effective control of C.
albicans was obtained, reducing contamination by 100% [8], as also
demonstrated by other authors, whose findings revealed that five minutes
of boiling water was sufficient to observe disinfection in a
pacifier contaminated with S. mutans and C. albicans [15]. Other
authors concluded that it is highly recommended to disinfect pacifiers
in boiling water for 15 minutes in order to eliminate
cariogenic microorganisms from pacifiers [10].
