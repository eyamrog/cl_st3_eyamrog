The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the current
pandemic of COVID-19, which uses the human membrane protein ACE2
as a gateway to the host-cell infection. We perform comparative
genomic analysis of 70 ACE2 placental mammal orthologues to identify
variations and contribute to the understanding of evolutionary dynamics behind
this successful adaptation to infect humans. Our results reveal that
4% of the ACE2 sites are under positive selection, all
located in the catalytic domain, suggesting possibly taxon-specific adaptations related
to the ACE2 function, such as cardiovascular physiology. Considering all
variable sites, we selected 30 of them located at the
critical ACE2 binding sites to the SARS-CoV-like viruses to analyze
in more detail. Our results reveal a relatively high diversity
of ACE2 between placental mammal species while showing no polymorphism
within human populations, at least considering the 30 inter-species variable
sites. A perfect scenario for natural selection favored this opportunistic
new coronavirus in its trajectory of infecting humans. We suggest
that SARS-CoV-2 became a specialist coronavirus for human hosts. Differences
in the rate of infection and mortality could be related
to the innate immune responses, other unknown genetic factors, as
well as non-biological factors.
