It is suggested as an option to washing the pacifiers
daily with running water and neutral detergent, with vigorous mechanical
action for at least 5 minutes [8]. Positive results were
also found by previous authors when using the product, following
this protocol [25]. Alternatively, the object can be rested in
a container with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite for 5 minutes, as
this agent was effective in total disinfection of pacifiers [8],
as well as in toothbrushes [26].
