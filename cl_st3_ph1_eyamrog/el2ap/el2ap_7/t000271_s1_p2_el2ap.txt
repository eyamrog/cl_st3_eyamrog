Methods: Data were collected on 2,857 blood donors from April
14 to 27, 2020. We report the crude prevalence of
antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the weighted prevalence by the total state
population, and adjusted prevalence estimates for test sensitivity and specificity.
To establish the correlates of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, we used logistic
regression models. The analysis included period and site of blood
collection, sociodemographic characteristics, and place of residence.
