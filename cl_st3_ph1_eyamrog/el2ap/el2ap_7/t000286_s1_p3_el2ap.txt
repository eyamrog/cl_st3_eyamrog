In Turkey, Various macroeconomic policies and reforms have been embarked
upon by government aimed at attracting FDI into the country,
but these efforts have appeared to be futile going by
the low and unsteady behavior of the level of foreign
direct investments. This has become a source of worry to
all concerned. Therefore, this work was set out to investigate
the impact of macroeconomic policy variables on Foreign Direct Investment
Inflow in Turkey. Data for the study were collected from
the Central Bank of Turkey statistical bulletin (1994 â€“ 2018).
Variables examined were exchange rates, inflation rates, interest rates, government
deficit. Findings revealed that all the explanatory variables jointly impact
on foreign direct investment inflow. Government deficit, exchange rates have
a significant positive effect on FDI in Turkey. Therefore, Government
should evolve sound policies that would strengthen the attraction of
Foreign Direct Investment Inflow in Turkey by paying more attention
to the identified macroeconomic policy variables. The variables have shown
to be a vital tool that could be used to
encourage the inflow of FDI into the country. The research
recommends that there is need for the creation of friendly
and enabling environment for FDI to thrive in Turkey.
