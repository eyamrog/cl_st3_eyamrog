During the analysis Gene S, Gene N and ORF10 were
identified. The interval around 3500 and the interval around 11000,
respectively, appear with high values of regularity and this do
not correspond to documented elements (both within Gene: Orf1ab). It
might be in the interest of giving importance to that
region.
