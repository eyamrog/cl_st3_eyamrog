However, it is very well known that subsequent to cell
entry, pathogens can be blocked by neutralizing host-antibodies, which appears
to be occurring in SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans (Conti et
al., 2020). According to the WHO the majority of humans
infected by SARS-CoV-2 have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, despite
the fact that they have the same AAs in the
ACE2 binding sites as reported here. The mechanisms of how
antibodies neutralize a coronavirus infection have already been published (Hofmann
et al., 2004; Reguera et al., 2012; Li et al.,
2020a), illustrating that an innate agile and efficient host-immune system
(like those in young individuals and/or in individuals who do
not develop an immunological over-response) is the first weapon to
block the infection of opportunistic coronaviruses. Eventual population variability in
other genetic systems, which may also be involved in this
heterogeneity of COVID-19 symptoms and outcomes, cannot be ruled out.
We must also remember that the ACE2 gene has many
polymorphisms outside the regions coding for key binding sites, as
mentioned in the last paragraph of the results section. In
this way, we cannot rule out that some of these
SNPs may also be involved in differential susceptibility for infection,
as well as to the differences in the symptoms and
outcomes observed across human populations.
