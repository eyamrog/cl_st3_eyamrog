In the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak in China,
a cross-sectional study found that nearly 60% of participants did
not meet the PA recommendations (<150 minutes of MVPA per
week). Moreover, they have found an association of PA levels
with fewer negative affect28. Our findings are in line with
the association found in China, suggesting that over 30 minutes
of daily MVPA is associated with reduced co-occurring depressive and
anxiety symptoms. In our study, 15 minutes or over of
VPA per day was associated with a lower prevalence of
depressive, anxiety, and co-occurring D&A symptoms. Also, we found a
linear association with depressive and anxiety symptoms severity, suggesting a
dose-response association. However, no linear associations were seen in the
present study between MPA or MVPA with depressive and anxiety
symptoms when we adjust for covariates. A potential explanation is
that during the pandemics, time spent in MPA might be
heavily influenced by time spent in household activities as most
household activities fall within this intensity range29. In turn, VPA
might more closely reflect leisure-time physical activity. According to previous
evidence, leisure-time PA is more likely to be associated with
positive mental health outcomes12 than household activities and those expending
long periods in household activities might not be experiencing the
same benefits.
