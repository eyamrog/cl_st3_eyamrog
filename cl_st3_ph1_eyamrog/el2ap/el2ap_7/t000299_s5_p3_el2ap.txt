Pacifier nozzles may be made of latex or silicone. Currently,
silicone nozzles are the preferred ones are the silicone ones,
because since they have lower allergenic potential, due to the
lower roughness and microbial adhesion [6,7]. Although the latex surface
was more irregular than the silicone surface, becoming a potential
biofilm reservoir and, consequently, a niche of infection [6], the
silicone pacifiers still have had potential for microorganism adhesion and
may be a considerable source of infection [4,7]. However, it
is proved that after disinfection procedures, the latex pacifiers showed
much more pores and roughness on the surface than those
without heat treatment [15].
