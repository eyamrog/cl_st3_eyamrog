Another important factor that has a relation with local conditions
and resources and we suggest for research is the climate,
associated with the effects of urbanization and the formation of
heat islands (Marengo 2007, Dias et al. 2013). Ecological studies
have shown an increasing relationship between the high mortality of
trees and climbers and climate extremes (Hubbell & Foster 1992,
Condit et al. 1996a,b, Curran et al. 1999, Nepstad et
al. 2007, Feeley et al. 2011). Rainfall monitoring in the
park itself over the course of 85 years (1933-2018) reveals
irregularities in short periods of time, as in the studied
period, which had the driest month (July 2008) and even
the wettest month and the second wettest year (January 2010)
of the whole historical series (EM-IAG 2017). Even though lianas
have greater competitive advantage (Schnitzer 2005), and the smaller shows
increasing abundance (Laurance et al. 2014), as well as observed,
they depend on well-developed phorophytes to transition to larger size
classes and to thrive (Phillips et al. 2005, Sfair et
al. 2013, Nogueira et al. 2014). As shown, the study
area presents small trees with slow growth, and the larger
ones (> 2.5 cm) presented higher mortality in comparison to
the recruitment, which is critical for the maintenance of the
abundance and basal area of the larger lianas (Nogueira et
al. 2014).
