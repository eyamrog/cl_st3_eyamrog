In this paper, we decided to evaluate the plant community
dynamics of different layers and life forms over the period
of 6.5 years, in an urban forest remnant from the
PEFI, a protected area surrounded by one of the largest
urban areas of the world (CONDEPHAAT 2018). Smaller individuals, such
as those found in the understory, are representative of forest
regeneration and may be more sensitive in disturbed environments (Gomes
et al. 2003, Salles & Schiavini 2007) and more dynamic
(Condit et al. 1996b, Machado & Oliveira- Filho 2010, Feeley
et al. 2011). Similarly, other life forms, such as climbers,
can be more dynamic when compared to shrubs and trees,
as shown by ecological studies done with this life form
(Wright et al. 2004, Phillips et al. 2005, Schnitzer 2005,
Nepstad et al. 2007, Laurance et al. 2014, Nogueira et
al. 2014), as we hypothesize to the plant community studied.
Therefore, we expect smaller individuals to have higher mortality and
recruitment rates, and the climbing plants to have the highest
dynamics (mortality and recruitment) compared to shrub-tree synusia.
