Furthermore, wide availability of testing for antibodies and the universal
testing of HCW would be a game changer as it:
1) reduces in-hospital transmission16; 2) reduces a potential source of
asymptomatic ongoing transmission during a period of social distancing; 3)
promotes the wellbeing of HCW ensuring that in- fected colleagues
are promptly tested and isolated17; 5) enables the service to
isolate those who require it, avoiding being short-staffed due to
self-isolation or widespread contamination of the HCW.
