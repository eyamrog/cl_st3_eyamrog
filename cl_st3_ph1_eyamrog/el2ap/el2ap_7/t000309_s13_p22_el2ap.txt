In cases of the occurrence of signs and symptoms suggestive
of COVID-19, the patient must immediately communicate with the healthcare
team. In this context, it is recommended to pause immunosuppressant
therapy until the infection resolves. The therapy can be resumed
after complete resolu- tion of the symptoms of COVID-19 or,
ideally, after two negative PCR tests of the nasopharyngeal swab,
collected with a more than 24-h interval between them (this
strategy is not currently feasible in Brazil, where there is
a shortage of tests for coronavirus) (14,20).
