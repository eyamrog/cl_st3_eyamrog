Such methodological strategies are examples of how to address the
teaching of a blind student in the classroom. They contribute
to avoid future issues of non-inclusion, lack of autonomy or
teacher unpreparedness, among other obstacles already mentioned that prevent this
student from fully learning. Even so, it is always important
to communicate with the student to verify which learning method
they prefer and comprehend the contents best (ULIANA, 2013; FERREIRA;
DICKMAN, 2015). Thereby, it is possible for the teacher and
the learner to come up with a good method that
works for both.
