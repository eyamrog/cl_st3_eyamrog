Given the total absence of official data, we have chosen
to take this first estimate and extrapolate it for the
1930s. By 1930, approximately 14% of the population lived in
urban centers, that is, more than 20,000 inhabitants (Bethell 1998:
31). Extrapolating these numbers, around 116,480 people worked in the
urban economy, and around 715,520 in the rural economy. De
la Torre (1993) estimates that in 1936, 55% of the
Quito population was marginally employed: 10.4% were day laborers, 23.5%
were independent workers, and 21.1% domestic workers. Public sector workers
represented 16.6% in 1936 (Naranjo, 2017).
