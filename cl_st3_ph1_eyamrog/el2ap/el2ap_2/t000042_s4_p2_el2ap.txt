The necropolitical policies of Bolsonaro and Modi can be summarized
as the embrace of an extreme notion of herd immunity
as a solution, the concealment of data about the sick
and the covert implementation of policies which effectively increase the
death rate of marginalized groups. These policies continued into later
phases marked by declines in mortality, and were able to
persist because of the fragmented resistance to them on the
part of civil society, the media and other actors. The
proper assignation of blame for the unnecessarily high mortality on
official necropolitics was considered politically untenable by many center and
right-wing politicians including those who privately questioned government policy, as
such an accusation against the ruling elite would expose its
complicity in classifying and treating certain segments of society as
disposable. For such politicians, “mismanagement” was a more convenient term
because this attenuated critique allowed the persistence of the necropolitical
norm, in a more subtle and even regulated form.
