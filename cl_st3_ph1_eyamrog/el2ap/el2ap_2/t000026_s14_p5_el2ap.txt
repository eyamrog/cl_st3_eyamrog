Anxiety Trait-State Inventory (IDATE): created by Spielberger et al. (1970)
and validated in Brazil by Biaggio and Natalício (1979). The
Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the instrument is 0.86 to 0.95
(Spielberger et al., 1980). It consists of two 40-item scales
distributed in a four-point Likert format, ranging from "4-very much"
to "1- absolutely not". The first scale evaluates the anxiety
state (IDATE-E), and the second evaluates the anxiety trait (IDATE-T).
Each evaluative part consists of 20 alternatives (Grös et al.,
2007). In this study, Cronbach’s alpha was 0.85, revealing that
the internal consistency of the data is satisfactory.
