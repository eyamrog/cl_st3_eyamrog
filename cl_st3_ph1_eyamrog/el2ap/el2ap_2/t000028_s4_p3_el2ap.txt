Some of the options for teachers to adapt didactic activities
are the use of tactile resources, sounds and songs, games
or group activities, which give emphasis on other senses than
vision. As a result of those changes, blind students would
not only feel more confident and free to participate in
classes – characteristics that are very important when learning an
additional language –, but also feel included by their teachers
and classmates.
