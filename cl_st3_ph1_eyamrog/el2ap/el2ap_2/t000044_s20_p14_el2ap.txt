When students share about subjects that were discussed during class
with other people, have you noticed that they often end
up using gestures to explore and explain their ideas and
concepts? According to research by Flood et al. (2014), this
would be like a publicly visible space-dynamic means of expression,
in which gestures and the body provide productive resources to
imagine the submicroscopic, three-dimensional, and dynamic phenomena of chemistry together.
