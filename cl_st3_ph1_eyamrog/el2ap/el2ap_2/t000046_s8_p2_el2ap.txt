This perspective has made PE an instrument to achieve health
or avoid diseases, based on a discourse of an “active
body,” which was, and still is, widely disseminated. In this
line, PE shows to be aligned with the understanding of
health defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), which is
conceived as complete physical, mental and social well-being. Thus, the
biophysical situation of people is prioritized, which we conceive as
a restricted conception of health.
