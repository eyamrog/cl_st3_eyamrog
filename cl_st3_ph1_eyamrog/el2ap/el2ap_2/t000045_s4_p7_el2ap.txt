A second aspect concerns the need to advance the understanding
of brokerage dynamics by paying attention to differences between the
electoral campaign period and the one beyond elections. This is
another aspect overlooked by the literature, which often bases its
propositions about brokers on observations related to campaign activities, overestimating
the electoral elements of these dynamics. In our study, it
was common for interviewees to downplay the electionâ€™s period importance
to claim credit for actions, suggesting this is a more
enduring and ongoing endeavor. Even if some works have recognized
the importance of brokers beyond elections and for the production
of other political outcomes, such as implementing public works and
social policies (Auyero, 2000; Zarazaga, 2014; Hoyler, Gelape, and Silotto,
2021), we need further research to elucidate the differences and
connections between these moments.
