‚óè Foam with Ibuprofen. Eight (10%) out of 70 studies
suggested using foam with Ibuprofen dressing as a therapy for
MFW pain management. The studies were of the non-systematic reviews
(87.5%) and survey (12.5%) types. None of the studies focused
on evaluating the foam with Ibuprofen for MFW-related pain management,
but only cited it as a dressing option for these
patients. In addition, no study mentioned how to use the
dressing or the results of its use.
