The novel coronavirus was preceded by communal unrest over the
announcement of controversial Citizenship Amendment Act in January 2020 that
discriminated against Muslims. In March 2020, a coronavirus outbreak at
the gathering of the Islamic congregation Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi,
led to unsubstantiated claims about the congregation being the epicenter
of thousands of coronavirus cases and dozens of deaths across
India.26 Fake news circulated in social media that Muslims “deliberately”
infected food and water with the virus. The Modi administration
condemned this tide of communal hatred only belatedly. Furthermore, COVID-19
intensified social taboos such as untouchability associated with the deeply
rooted caste system. The notions of purity and pollution, key
to the caste-based division of Indian society into Brahmins (the
priestly class), Kshatriyas (warriors), Vaisyas(traders), and Sudras (workers), and the
unclassified Dalits who exist at the bottom of the caste
hierarchy and are despised because they hold menial jobs such
as sanitation work, cremation of human bodies and removal of
animal carcasses. Dalits were preponderant among the victims of the
pandemic’s first wave.27 Necropolitics—in the Indian context, during the first
wave of COVID-19— manifested together with the denial of human
rights to the Muslim minority and to Dalits, the deprecation
of menial labor and hostility towards migrant workers.
