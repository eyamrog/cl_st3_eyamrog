In general terms, the main finding of the study was
that 58.8% of health students with high trait anxiety and
60.5% of those with moderate state anxiety used anxiolytic drugs.
In addition, students attending public universities made greater use of
anxiolytic drugs. These data are corroborated by a national study
conducted by Marchi et al. (2013), which revealed that 34%
of nursing students at a public university have mild anxiety,
and 16% of them use or have used some type
of anxiolytic medication.
