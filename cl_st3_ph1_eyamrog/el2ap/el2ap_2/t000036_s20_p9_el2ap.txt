The other twenty-five percent of the population was made up
of wage workers and farmers, who were immersed in internal
trade. The remaining percentage of the economically active population was
made up of public sector workers, merchants, industry owners, renters,
who actively participated in the local market. This percentage of
the population was also related to the external sector, that
is, they were those who consumed imported goods and those
who produced export goods.
