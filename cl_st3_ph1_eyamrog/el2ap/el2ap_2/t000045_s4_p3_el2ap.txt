These conclusions about the Brazilian case might be relevant for
other contexts, especially for: (i) decentralized countries in which municipalities
have political autonomy, responsibilities in critical policy areas, and where
local politicians have a prominent position in the political system;
(ii) countries in which municipal elections are held separately from
elections for the other levels; (iii) settings with a poorly
institutionalized party system where other elements prove critical in articulating
multilevel alliances.
