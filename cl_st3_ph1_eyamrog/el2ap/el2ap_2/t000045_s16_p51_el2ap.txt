In both waves of the survey, allocating amendments was the
third most valued parliamentary activity (among five categories) – 16.0%
in the first wave and 18.2% in the second –
behind lawmaking and solving state problems. Thus, it is not
insignificant, but it does not figure in the first position
either. These answers may suffer from a social desirability bias.
Still, it is worth noting that amendments may be central
to the relationship between legislators and their local brokers but
not necessarily to their performance as state representatives. Moreover, the
bias of our sample of interviewees among “municipalists” may strengthen
the relevance of pork barrel for these legislators.
