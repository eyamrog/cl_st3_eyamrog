MFWs are complex chronic wounds that originate from uncontrolled proliferation
of infiltrating malignant cells, disrupting skin integrity. Over time, these
wounds evolve and deteriorate, becoming more extensive and invasive (Hoshi
et al., 2019; Tilley et al., 2020; Young, 2017). Approximately
4% -15% of cancer patients develop this type of injury
(Firmino et al., 2020) that predominately involve breasts (62 to
66%), head and neck (24%), and the chest due to
the proximity of the compromised tissue to the skin (EONS,
2015; Firmino et al., 2020; Neves Duarte Lisboa, 2016; O'Neill
et al., 2022). According to the Haisfield-Wolfe and Baxendale-Cox staging
system, people with MFWs in their advanced stages are beleaguered
by debilitating symptoms, including odor, exudate, itching, bleeding, and pain
(Haisfield-Wolde ME, 1999). These symptoms can present significant challenges to
patients, caregivers, and health professionals (Santos & Fuly, 2015; Tilley
et al., 2020).
