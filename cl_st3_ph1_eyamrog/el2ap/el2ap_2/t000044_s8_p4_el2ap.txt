However, what about the role of gestures between a teacher
and his student when it comes to teaching and learning?
What constitutes an important communication channel for classroom teaching and
learning? How can gestures help in teaching? Is there research
in education in the field of gesture analysis and teaching?
Imbued with these questions, a literature review was conducted bringing
the most relevant aspects and research related to education on
this topic. Based on these questions, the present literature review
seeks to answer the following question, that generally synthetizes our
goals: What is the contribution of gestures (non-verbal communication) to
the teaching and learning process?
