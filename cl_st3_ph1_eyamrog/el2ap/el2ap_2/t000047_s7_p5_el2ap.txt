The latter, considered as being formal, pinpoints a theoretical sphere.
That is, a particular theoretical underpinning which manifests to analysts
the embodiment-cum-description of a mode, projecting the semiotic resource as
being professionally-based. It is deducible then that the characteristic values
of a mode are tethered around history, culture, and science,
as the trilogy promote meaning potential of a communicative entity.
As a result, one might argue that a mode is
a unit of analysis that generates to transfer meaning from
one social actor to another. These features are some of
the reasons for considering multimodality as an interdisciplinary adventure, explored
through social semiotics.
