Initially, Modi and many Indian authorities thought of COVID-19 as
a great leveler because of its ability to contaminate anyone
without distinction to religion, race or nationality. Public health announcements
related to social distancing, home quarantine or hand-washing did not
take into account how caste inequalities correlated to discrepancies of
community-access to sanitary housing or potable water supplies. Proper home
quarantine required allocating a separate well-ventilated room to those isolating.
But 17% of Dalit households were poorly-ventilated and frequent hand-washing
with soap was unaffordable for nearly 71% of Dalits.28 As
a result, pre- existing inequalities meant differential exposures to the
pandemic across various social groups in India.
