An issue frequently addressed in these principal-agent analyses concerns the
agent’s responsiveness to the principal’s objectives and how bosses select
brokers and monitor their actions to ensure that they will
act in their interests (Stokes et al., 2013; Aspinall, 2014;
Gingerich, 2020; Holland and Palmer-Rubin, 2015). Many scholars assume that
there is a disjunction between the interests of brokers and
politicians/parties that presents risks for the latter concerning optimization and
return on investment (Stokes et al., 2013). Thus, it is
not enough for brokers to be recognized leaders in their
communities. They also need to demonstrate the ability to mobilize
voters. The principal, for its turn, needs to find observable
indicators to guide and monitor brokers’ performance. Some of the
indicators used by bosses are the number of votes delivered
by brokers (Szwarcberg, 2012; Gingerich, 2020), attendance at campaign events
(Szwarcberg, 2012; Muñoz, 2014), and the size of the networks
brokers can build (Stokes et al., 2013).
