As we have already stated, the literature on electoral mobilization
via brokers highlights different indicators and metrics used by voters,
candidates, politicians, and brokers to assess and monitor participants’ behavior
in mediation dynamics. On the one hand, the literature’s assumption
and the previous section’s evidence suggest that alliances between local
leaders and state representatives can benefit both sides. On the
other hand, analyses inspired by principal- agent theories emphasize the
importance of monitoring brokers and providing them private rewards (Camp,
2015) to minimize agency losses. For these analyses, it would
be essential to ensure that parties can estimate when it
is worth maintaining or breaking off the relationship and how
much energy, time, and resources to allocate. In our case,
how do state representatives evaluate the results of partnerships with
local leaders and the prospects for electoral returns?
