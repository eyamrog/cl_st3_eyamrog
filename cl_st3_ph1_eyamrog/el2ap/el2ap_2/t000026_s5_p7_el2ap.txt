In contrast, an international study by Nazir et al. (2021)
reported that female university students had higher levels of trait
anxiety (M = 48.45, SD = 12.79, p <0.001) compared
to males who had higher levels of state anxiety (M
= 41.85, SD = 8.91, p <0.001). Studies have shown
that manifestations of trait anxiety in university students may be
related to personality traits and a stable tendency to experience
anxiety in academic situations (Bados et al., 2010; Williams &
Crawford, 2016).
