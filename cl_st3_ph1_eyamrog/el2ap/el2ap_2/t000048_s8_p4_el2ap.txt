From an economic point of view, it is possible to
find in the order many species of food interest, such
as Musa paradisiaca L. (banana tree), which produces edible parthenocarpic
fruits (Souza & Lorenzi 2005) and Zingiber officinale Roscoe (ginger),
used in drinks and confectionery production (Elpo & Negrelle 2004);
also species of ornamental interest, such as Goeppertia ornata (Lem.)
Borchs. & Su√°rez (pin-stripe calathea) for having attractive leaves (Vieira
et al. 2012), Heliconia bihai (L.) L. (firebird), Canna indica
L. (canna lily) and Strelitzia reginae Banks (bird-of- paradise flower)
(Lorenzi & Souza 2001, Souza & Lorenzi 2005, Castro et
al. 2011) known for producing striking inflorescences; and at last,
kinds of popular medicinal interest, like Curcuma longa L. (turmeric),
used in treatments for respiratory diseases (Santiago et al. 2015).
