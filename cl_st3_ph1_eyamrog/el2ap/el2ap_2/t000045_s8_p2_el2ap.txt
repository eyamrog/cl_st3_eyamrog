Several studies on the Brazilian case highlight the importance of
the relationships between legislators and local politicians and the mediating
role played by the latter (Bezerra, 1999; Avelino, Biderman, and
Barone, 2012; Barone, 2014; Novaes, 2018). The general idea is
that representatives serve and allocate resources to their geographically concentrated
bases, and, in exchange, local brokers channel votes for the
legislators. These studies generally rely on assumptions about actors' motivations
and the observable outcomes of alliances, without providing evidence of
the mechanisms that underlie these relationships. In this paper, we
examine to what extent the theoretical framework used to analyze
relationships between brokers and bosses in comparative politics is adequate
to explain the relationship between legislators and local politicians in
Brazil. To this end, we investigate how these relationships are
built, maintained, and eventually broken, confronting our findings with would
be predicted by theory.
