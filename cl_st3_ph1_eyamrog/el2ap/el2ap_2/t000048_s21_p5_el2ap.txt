The species showed few fruiting records throughout this research, the
fruits of G. monophylla were seen only once, being present
in a few individuals. The absence of fruiting records may
be due to a failure in the collection, since the
fruits develop inside the bracts that are usually going through
a blackening process, which are very hard to visualize.
