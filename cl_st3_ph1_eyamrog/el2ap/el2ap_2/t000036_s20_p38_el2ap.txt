As part of the labor situation of workers in the
thirties, it is relevant to analyze the establishment of the
minimum wage as the state and legal recognition of minimum
lower barriers necessary for the support of a person. In
the specific case of Ecuador, the minimum wage was legalized
taking into account the difference between regions and labor groups,
thus, for example, 25 sucres was imposed for jobs in
the interior, 50 sucres for jobs on the coast, 37.5
sucres for jobs in the capital. Next, the implementation of
regulations regarding the minimum wage in Latin America will be
reviewed.
