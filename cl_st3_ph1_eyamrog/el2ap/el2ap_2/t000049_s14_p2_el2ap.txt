The ‘promotion from within’ approach was adopted (Bondioli, 2008; Bondioli,
Savio, 2009; Bondioli, 2015a e b, Savio, 2003; Bondioli, Savio,
2012; Savio, 2013) in order to maintain a close connection
between the theories and sources previously mentioned. This approach is
included in the previously outlined conceptual framework and it is
characterized by a participative strategy, even because the planning of
the educational actions originates from the child’s curiosity, and it
welcomes its suggestions.
