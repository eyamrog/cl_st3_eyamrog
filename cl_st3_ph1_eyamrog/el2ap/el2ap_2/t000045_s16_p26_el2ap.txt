First, our evidence contests the idea that friendship and feelings
of reciprocity are not important in relationships between legislators and
local brokers. In the 2007 and 2012 waves of the
survey, legislators’ answers do not point to the predominance of
one single factor to explain how they were able to
get mayors’ and councilors’ support: personal and family relations stand
out (25.6% as the main factor in 2007, and 32.4%
in 2012), carrying out public works in the locality (26.7%
in 2007) or channeling resources for the region (15.3% in
2012), party relations (14% and 21%, respectively) or supporting the
campaign of mayors and councilors (11.6% and 15.3%). Thus, while
the focus of recent literature has been on party relations,
the scenario shown by the survey is more diverse.
