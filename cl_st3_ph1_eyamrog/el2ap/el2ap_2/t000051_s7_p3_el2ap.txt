In this article, I analyse the German federal chancellor Olaf
Scholz’s policy statement held in the German parliament on 27
February 2022, investigating which major discourses compete in the speech
and how Scholz uses them to legitimise his policies. Specifically,
I analyse, first, the attitude, that is, the emotional reactions
and judgements transmitted in the speech and how the speaker
aligns himself to particular discourses, from an appraisal theoretic perspective
(MARTIN & WHITE, 2005). Second, I analyse the speaker’s engagement,
that is, how different discourses are brought into competition, seen
as centripetal-centrifugal struggle through the lens of Bakhtinian dialogism, and
how Scholz thus justifies his policies. To begin, I describe
the genre of policy statements and its communicative functions.
