The present work is qualitative research, as it “grounded in
a philosophical position which is broadly ‘interpretivist’ in the sense
that it is concerned with how the social world is
interpreted, understood, experienced, produced or constituted” and “based on methods
of data generation which are both flexible and sensitive to
the social context in which data are produced” (MASON, 2002,
p. 3). From this perspective, the researcher isn’t and “cannot
be neutral, or objective, or detached, from the knowledge and
evidence they are generating” (MASON, 2002, p. 7).
