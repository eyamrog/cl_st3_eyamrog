Finally, elections emerged as the main event to explain discontinuities.
Electoral defeats (whether of legislators, mayors, or city councilors) can
lead to the end of alliances and serve as an
opportunity for new partnerships among those still in office. It
is also clear that except for the discontinuity resulting from
elections, state representatives rarely explicitly break-up a relationship with their
brokers. They may not try as hard to assist a
mayor or a councilor who did not perform well in
terms of votes delivered, but they still work on other
compensation strategies. When they occur, the break-ups seem to come
from mayors, who start to consider other legislators and search
for more promising partnerships to raise financial resources and benefits
for their hometowns â€“ a phenomenon also observed by Bezerra
(1999).
