Selecting brokers and maintaining relationships seems to be a diverse
and dynamic process. Our interviews suggest at least three distinct
dynamics. Some historical partners remain loyal for a long time
due to past collaborative work and personal affinities. In these
cases, partnerships may endure even when the legislator feels disappointed
with the number of votes cast in the municipality or
when the mayor’s requests have not been fully met. There
are short- lived, circumstantial partnerships that end up being broken
because one side feels disappointed by the partner’s lack of
commitment or because some shift in the local political context.
The absence of other strong ties – regional, friendship, affinity,
shared past experiences – makes it less costly for both
parts to break this relationship and search for new allies.
The short-term evaluation of fulfilled requests and delivered votes weigh
in this case. Finally, there are uncertain partners, a mayor
or local councilor who has received a benefit but about
whom the legislator does not feel secure about. These are
alliances that advisors tend not to include in their accounting
of expected votes. They enter as “extras” that may or
may not materialize.
