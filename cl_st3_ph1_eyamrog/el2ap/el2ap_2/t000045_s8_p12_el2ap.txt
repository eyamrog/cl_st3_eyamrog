Several studies have already shown that mayors to cultivate links
with state and national representatives to allow them to carry
out investments in infrastructure and public works projects, which are
taken as one main indicator of a good administration at
the local level (Palmeira and Goldman, 1996; Bezerra, 1999). Moreover,
mayors can exhibit these connections as a distinctive sign before
voters, a symbol of power and prestige they can convert
into benefits for the municipality (Chaves, 1996; Bezerra, 1999; Eduardo,
2016). Much of the congressmen, in turn, would also be
dependent on mayors to get credit for the delivered benefits,
build a good reputation in their region and, consequently, win
votes.
