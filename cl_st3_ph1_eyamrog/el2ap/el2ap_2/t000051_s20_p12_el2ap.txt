The theme of the first course of action Scholz announces
is support to Ukraine, which now also includes arms delivery
to a conflict zone, an activity that has hitherto been
tabu in Germany. I identify this as the Germany as
military power discourse at the level of the proximal not-yet-spoken.
Scholz picks up the watershed discourse (“in einer neuen Zeit”,
‘in a new era’), which constructs a “neue Realität” (‘new
reality’) to give credence to the claim that the policy
shift in arms delivery to conflict zones is necessary. Disagreement
on this is forestalled by presenting it as without alternative,
through the dialogically contractive denial “konnte es keine andere Antwort
geben” (‘there could be no other response’).
