The 1988 Constitution established municipalitiesâ€™ political and administrative autonomy, which
increased the importance of local leaders, especially mayors. However, most
Brazilian municipalities remain dependent on resource transfers from upper levels
(Bremaeker, 2018). Their infrastructural shortcomings induce mayors to cultivate relationships
with congressmen as a way to ensure the flow of
resources and benefits to their localities and, consequently, pave the
way to electoral success.
