In daily dental practice, the radiographic evaluation of the MC
is mostly performed on periapical, panoramic and CBCT images with
a percentage of visibility of 28%, 32% and 98% respectively
[24]. On conventional two-dimensional (2D) radiography, the MC appears as
a radiolucent image, with two well-defined radiopaque borders, inferior to
the mandibular molars and premolars roots [25]. This typical appearance
is mainly due to the principle of the radiographic lines
formation. A radiopaque radiographic line is visible whenever the primary
X-ray beam is perpendicular to the surface of separation of
two different densities. In the case of the MC, the
two different densities are due to the trabecular bone and
the inferior neurovascular bundle.
