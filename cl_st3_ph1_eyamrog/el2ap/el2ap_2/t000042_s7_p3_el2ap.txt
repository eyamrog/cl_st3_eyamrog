The impact of COVID-19 in Brazil and India respectively must
be understood in the context of two exacerbating factors that
historically preceded the time of their authoritarian governments: racism and
discrimination. In Brazil, Blacks, people of mixed-race and indigenous Amazonian
communities—who account for over half of the population— suffered disproportionately
due to COVID-19. Likewise in India—even though the 1950 Constitution
outlawed discrimination based on religion and caste—the country’s sizeable Muslim
minority, its Dalits (Hindus, formerly known as untouchables in the
caste-system and traditionally involved in menial labor) and inter-state migrant
workers faced social segregation and have borne the brunt of
the nationwide lockdown. The first wave of COVID-19 in Brazil
and India corresponds to one of the three phases or
"acts" in the "epidemic drama" model espoused by the medical
historian Charles Rosenberg. During a pandemic, communities seek rational explanations
of the phenomenon in terms that promise control, including minimizing
their own sense of vulnerability and responsibility. This can include
the assignation of blame for the contagion to a minority
group.7
