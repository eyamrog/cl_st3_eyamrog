The richness of materials collected during the research and its
quantitative and qualitative analysis provided fundamental data to identify the
parameters of an educational approach sustaining a favorable context for
the development of scientific attitudes. In this scenario, these attitudes
refer to an active investigation that leads to an autonomous
and participative construction of knowledge and a scientific understanding (Andersson,
Gullberg, 2014; Onida, Salvadori, 2020). The analysis of the materials
also provided indications regarding how to support the development of
a science-oriented behavior, which furthers the reflection on issues and
the comprehension of how this complex world and the entanglements
and relations that characterize it work (Arc√†, Mazzoli, 1995; Bertolino,
Guerra, Schenetti, Antonacci, 2017).
