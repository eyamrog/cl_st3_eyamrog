Gestural understanding remains poorly studied, according to Dimitrova, Özçalışkan, and
Adamson (2017), from Sweden, especially with children with autism spectrum
and who have difficulty in producing gestures. Following the studies
by McNeill (2005), these groups of researchers examined children aged
2 to 4 years old, to understand the types of
gestures and the combinations between gesture and speech. The results
obtained suggest that children understand deictic gestures and reinforcement gestures
- better speech combinations than iconic/conventional gestures and supplementary combinations
- a pattern that remains robust at different ages in
children with autism spectrum.
