From the Constitution, approved on November 10th, 1937, Brazil accepted
the prevailing need for a “minimum wage capable of satisfying,
according to each region, the normal needs of work” (Owen
1938:326). For this purpose, various commissions were organized to raise
minimum wages based on geographic division. These differentiated salaries were
later approved through an executive decree.
