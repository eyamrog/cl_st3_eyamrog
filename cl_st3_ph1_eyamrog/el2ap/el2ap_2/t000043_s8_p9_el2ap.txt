Just like the SCCS, the SCRI design controls for fixed
confounding factors like sex, race, genetic factors, preexisting health conditions
and geographical locations. For time varying confounders like seasonality and
age, there is a need for explicit adjustments, like in
the case of vaccines, the adverse effects vary especially among
children and can also vary over the follow up period
and be confounded with other factors giving a false positive
impression of the vaccine effects (13,14). Unlike SCCS that includes
both the vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals in the case of
the analysis of adverse effects after vaccination, the SCRI design
only includes vaccinated cases. (13). This is the primary strength
of the SCRI design as it reduces bias that can
arise among the vaccinated and unvaccinated cases (16).
