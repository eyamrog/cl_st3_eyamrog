Advisors call their work on municipalities and with local leaders
as “political affairs” (“trabalho político”), in contrast with other activities.
All interviewees estimated the number of allied municipalities, and almost
all of them showed us spreadsheets with the legislator's municipalities’
list. Each spreadsheet was organized differently, but, in general, they
contained the municipalities’ names, number of votes given to the
state legislator in the last election, and the reference broker’s
name (which could be the mayor, a councilor, a former
mayor, a former councilor, or, more rarely, a community leader).
