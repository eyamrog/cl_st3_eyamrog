With few exceptions (Auyero, 2000; Lawson and Greene, 2011; Finan
and Schechter, 2012), this literature does not tend to give
importance to the role played by friendship and feelings of
gratitude, reciprocity, and obligation in the dynamics of political brokerage.
These can be mechanisms for creating or enforcing relationships and
antidotes against opportunistic or predatory behavior. In many studies, these
relationships are seen as a market transaction, guided by instrumental
calculations (Brusco, Nazareno & Stokes, 2003; Stokes et al., 2013;
Zarazaga, 2014; Camp, 2015).
