In April 2021, the government allowed "super-spreader" events such as
the Kumbh Mela (a major Hindu festival on the banks
of the Ganges) without ensuring adequate mitigation measures. The inadequacy
of government policy became evident by May of 2021 when
a second wave was triggered by the more pathogenic Delta
variant, against which “herd immunity” was relatively ineffective. The Delta
variant spread like wildfire, with the new-case incidence reaching a
daily average of 325,000. At the time, the country accounted
for more than 40% of the world’s new cases. In
early June 2021, Modi made former Minister of Health Harsh
Vardhan a scapegoat and removed him from the Cabinet. Modi
also laid the blame for the second wave on state
governments rather than his own federal administration. His objective was
to explain the tragedy as a result of mismanagement of
subordinate authorities and not as an outcome of his policies.
Later, as coronavirus-related mortality declined, media attention to the crisis
also diminished.
