The quality and Effectiveness of Factor Score estimates (Ferrando e
Lorenzo-Seva 2018) showed: Factor Determinacy Index (FDI = 0.982) for
factor 1, and (FDI = 0.933) for factor 2; ORION
marginal reliability showed (ORION = 0.964) for factor 1 and
(ORION = 0.871) for factor 2 as factorial score reliability
indicators. Finally, the Sensitivity ratio (SR) score was for the
first factor (SR = 5.200) and (SR = 2.597) for
the second factor.
