Pain is the most common concern of all symptoms related
to people living with MFWs. However, pain is a subjective
experience that is difficult to assess objectively; evaluation relies on
self-reported measures (Raja et al., 2020). Therefore, using validated instruments
to evaluate pain systematically is essential to monitor and benchmark
the efficacy of pain treatment over time (Caraceni & Shkodra,
2019).
