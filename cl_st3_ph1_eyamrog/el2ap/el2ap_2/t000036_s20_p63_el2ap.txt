In the report, the Minister of Government and Social Security,
Mr. Rodolfo Baquerizo Moreno, recommended that in order to put
into practice the desire to set salaries, “it was convenient
for the Honorable Congress to issue a Special Law on
the individual, prior to the in-depth study of the various
zones and customs of the country” (Baquerizo 1934:74).
