In the second group, the percentage of the population that
was made up of salaried workers and farmers, we have
little information, which comes from primary sources from the center
of the country. According to salary data paid in 1936
to baker's assistants, they received between 2-5 sucres daily (figure
1), which could represent a sum of between 40 and
100 sucres per month, which could include between 4 and
10 sucres more if weekends are taken into account. The
work in the large cattle ranches was better paid, with
a salary of around 75 sucres per month in 1936.
In addition, as the account book shows (figure 2), the
workers also received extra payments in goods, be they in
cattle, beef, sheep, potatoes, corn, etc.
