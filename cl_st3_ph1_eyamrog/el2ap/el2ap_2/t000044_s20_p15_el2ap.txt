Laburú, Silva, and Zômpero (2015) researched high school students about
concepts of Electrostatics through experimental activities, intending to understand the
scientific concepts of students. When evaluating the students through the
experimental activity, it was found that the concepts cannot be
“visualized” and their incorrect domain, or the lack of it,
can unduly demonstrate conceptual unintelligibility, and the difficulty of the
apprentice can be located in these elements and not in
the conceptual dimension, as such. Therefore, the gestures contribute, according
to these researchers, as an instrument for the teacher to
understand what students are learning about scientific knowledge and, besides,
it ends up being fundamental for the construction of the
thought of that knowledge.
