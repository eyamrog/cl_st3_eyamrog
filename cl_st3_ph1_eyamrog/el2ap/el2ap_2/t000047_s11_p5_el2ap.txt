The writer might submit that the consideration of inanimate objects
as modal devices covers complex and multiple grounds because of
their natural and scientific connotation and connectivity. Each mode in
this category has relevantly correlated theories of exploration (Heitzmann, 1998;
Howells, 2003; O’Toole, 2011; Ravelli & McMurtrie, 2016, Bateman, Wildfeuer
& Hiippala, 2017; Forceville, 2020). It thus infers that the
modes to be analyzed determine the class of conceptual schedules
to be applied. No data strata can attract all the
conceptual agenda of Modics (theory of modes). There is a
conceptual division of labor in debating multimodality. Color and music
are the last modal entry conditions, in which van Leeuwen’s
(2010; 2014; 2016) parametric principle and van Leeuwen’s (2011) rhythmic
insight, among others, are explorers of such modes. All items
mentioned in Figure 1 are modes owing to the fact
that these elements have fulfilled the characteristic values of scientific
analyses that generate substantial meaning potentials. The various aspects of
human society reflecting modes appear to project multimodality as an
ambitious field. Anyway, that is the current coagulated academic model
of meaning production in terms of dialogue, interaction, conversation, and
communication in general.
