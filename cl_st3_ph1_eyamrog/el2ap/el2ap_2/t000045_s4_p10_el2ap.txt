Our findings have several analytical implications for studying the mediation
dynamics between political actors at different levels. They suggest some
promising research paths, such as research designs based on innovative
network analysis, the use of social media to identify and
analyze multilevel alliances, longitudinal analyses capable of measuring factors associated
with stability and discontinuities, and qualitative research techniques focused on
mechanisms underlying these relationships. We also stress that using comparative
(cross-country or subnational) and multi-method research designs is an important
tool to maximize the inferential potential of analyses in this
field. Part of the questions we raised are based on
interviews in a single state and from a specific legislator
profile. Comparative research designs which integrate additional quantitative and qualitative
evidence would allow us to further explore some of the
research avenues proposed in the previous lines.
