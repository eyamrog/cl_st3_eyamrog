The tables (Table 3, 4, 5) describing the manifestation of
scientific behaviours in children during the encounters prove that groups
A (promotion from within) and B (promotion from within and
later discussion) appear different from group C (no intervention to
promote the scientific attitude), especially when it concerns the experimentation
category (A=6, B=10, C=1) and the detection of the problem
(A=10, B=5, C=0). Instead, the differences appear to be minimal
in the detection of the phenomena and in the exploration
categories. This suggests that providing children with stimulating materials and
letting them explore said materials freely, although fundamental, is not
sufficient to activate more articulated and complex scientific attitudes. Essentially,
these attitudes, belonging to Dewey’s inquiry process, were manifested in
the groups where the materials were provided and explored freely
but also followed by the support of an adult, who
planned interventions embodied in the theoretical and methodological framework of
Bruner’s tutoring (1967) and Vygotsky’s zone of proximal development (1934;
1938). Therefore, these interventions aimed not only at furthering the
manifestation of scientific attitudes but also at developing and enriching
them by promoting learning processes.
