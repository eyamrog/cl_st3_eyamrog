Dialogic contraction through pronouncement is used to assert that Putin
started the war “aus einem einzigen Grund” (‘for a single
reason’), which disqualifies the indivisible security discourse in favour of
a Putin’s war discourse that casts the invasion as an
unprovoked attack on the free world by a potentially unhinged
individual actor who wants “ein unabhängiges Land von der Weltkarte
tilgen” (‘to wipe an independent country off the map’).
