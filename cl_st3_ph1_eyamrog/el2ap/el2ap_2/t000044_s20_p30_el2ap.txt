Recently, in 2019, Huang, Kim, and Christianson, from the University
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign presented that gestures are useful if
they are not to be confused with other words to
be learned and if the number of words presented was
limited. This research showed that introducing new words in a
second language and presenting the word with simultaneous gestures can
facilitate the recall of new words by students. The researchers
address the theory of double coding, in which it predicts
that students can learn better by having the articulation between
gestures and new words.
