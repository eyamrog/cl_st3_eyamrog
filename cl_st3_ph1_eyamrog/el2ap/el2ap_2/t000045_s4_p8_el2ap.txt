A third analytical task is to explore the differences that
characterize the relationships of local brokers with state or national
representatives. It was surprising to find such striking similarities between
our analysis and aspects reported by Bezerra (1999) in a
study carried out twenty years ago. Future research should investigate
the reasons for these similarities, especially given the differences in
duties and authority between national and state legislators. They might
be due to the similar incentives generated by national and
state representatives sharing the same rules and running in the
same electoral district, for example. Nevertheless, we also registered differences,
such as the greater volume of resources available to national
legislators to assist their allies and the greater proximity state
legislatorâ€™s have to their constituencies. It is thus reasonable to
expect some kind of division of labor among legislators, and
that local brokers decide whom to turn to depending on
the problem or need to be addressed.
