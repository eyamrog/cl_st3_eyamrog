To culminate the ad, as a voice says that New
Oral-B toothpaste [is] for strong teeth with long lasting fresh
breath, the image of the lady comes up again with
some gestural behaviors of: raising up of her hands and
breathing a fresh breath into the two hands; and again
raising up of the right hand, using a finger to
tap her teeth for about two consecutive times. The former
gesture designates fresh breath. The later signals strong teeth to
the larger audience. As the communication commences with rhythmic music
of low tempi, the communicator ends the ad with melodious
sounds of high tempi. The ambient musical sound functions in
the form of orchestra throughout the communication events (Till, 2017).
Moreover, the finale of two seconds witnesses a high musical
tempo accompanied with some shouts of Smile, Smile, Smile. The
Smile imperative clauses command viewers to smile for people to
see the nature of their teeth; perhaps, the teeth are
white or otherwise. If white, that is the act of
Oral-B on their teeth; if otherwise, Oral-B is still much
available to correct the dirt on their teeth. In other
words, the repetitive smile commands direct viewers to replicate the
smiling behaviors of the three actors in the communication. The
purpose is to understand the quality of the viewersâ€™ teeth
whether the teeth have the characteristic values of 2-IN-1 as
advertised in the video.
