That discourse is also reflected in the phrase in example
(3), where Scholz anticipates a potential argument that points to
the OSCE accords. To exclude such Eurasian partnership arguments, he
connects the indivisible security discourse with the watershed discourse by

in Europe is only possible with Russia, but counters it
by stating that for the foreseeable future Russia endangers that
security, supported by a pronouncement in the last sentence.
