The government of President Arturo Alessandri (1932-1938), “by decree no.
1009 of October 11, 1935, appointed a commission to study
the conditions of application of the minimum wage and propose
legal measures that would substantially improve the income of workers
through the family wage” (Yáñez 2019:12). This commission proposed a
living and family wage for different areas of the country,
which should meet the basic needs of an entire year,
especially an intake of 3,000 calories per day for each
worker. The result was a salary of 10.50 pesos in
Zone I, and 8.03 in Zone V.
