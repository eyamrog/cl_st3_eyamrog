The mandibular canal (MC), located within the mandible, carries the
inferior alveolar nerve (IAN), which is a branch of the
mandibular nerve, the third division of the trigeminal nerve, and
the inferior alveolar vessels (artery and vein) [1,2]. The IAN
supplies sensation to the mandibular teeth and gingivae and branches
into: a) the mental nerve which exits the MC through
the mental foramen supplying sensory innervations to the chin and
lower lip and b) the mylohyoid nerve providing motor innervations
to the mylohyoid muscle [2,3].
