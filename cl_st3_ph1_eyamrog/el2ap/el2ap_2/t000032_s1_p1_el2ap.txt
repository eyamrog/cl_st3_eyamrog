Atlhetes' mood states may vary depending on match contexts. This
study analyzes present mood states variations over time in 18
male youth soccer players (Mage: 15.4 Â± 0.266 years) during
a competitive season. The Present Mood States List (PMSL) was
applied for the assessment of present mood states 40 minutes
before each Event in a sequence of training sessions and
matches. The presence values of each PMSL Factor were calculated
in each Event for each soccer player. Specific patterns of
changes in mood states have been detected over time. Furthermore,
depending on which Event was related to a specific match,
some mood states differed in their pattern of change. The
importance of including the dynamic component of time as an
influential variable in athlete mood states changes is discussed.
