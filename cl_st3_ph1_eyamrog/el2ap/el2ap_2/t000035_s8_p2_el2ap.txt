The Brazilian Federal Constitution and the Organic Health Laws (Law
No. 8,080/1990 and Law No. 9,836/1999) recognize the specific ethnic
and cultural characteristics of indigenous peoples. The health of the
indigenous population requires a complementary and targeted model of services
aimed at the protection, promotion and recovery of health3,4, detailed
in the National Policy for the Health Care of Indigenous
Peoples4 and in the Guidelines of the Indigenous Component of
the National Oral Health Policy5,6. The purpose of these policies
is to guarantee comprehensive care in accordance with the principles
and guidelines of the National Health Service (or SUS), respecting
social, cultural, geographical, historical and political diversity, and recognizing the
effectiveness of traditional medicine, to overcome factors that make this
population more vulnerable to health problems.
