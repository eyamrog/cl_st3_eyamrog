Given the current scenario, it is necessary to emphasize that
both the PCN â€“ cross-sectional health theme (BRASIL, 2000) and
the BNCC (BRASIL, 2017), indicate that health is clearly understood
as an object of knowledge that should be approached by
the different curricular components and at all levels of basic
education, respecting the maturation of the student with a proposal
of progressive contents.
