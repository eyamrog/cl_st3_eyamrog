The Caatinga climate is semi-arid, forming vegetation mosaics, mostly deciduous,
xerophilous and prickly plants, with poorly distributed rainfall and precipitation
in a period of three to six months (IBGE 2004,
Silva et al. 2017). In the Northern backland depression, rainfall
is more concentrated in this ecoregion than in other parts
of the Caatinga, varying from 500 to 800 mm (Veloso
et al. 2002).
