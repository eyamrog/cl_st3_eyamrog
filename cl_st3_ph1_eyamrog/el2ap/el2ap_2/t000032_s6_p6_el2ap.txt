Nogueira (2009) and Silva (2013) showed high presence values in
locution with a greater correlation load with Factor XI (Receptivity)
after the matches in which they were defeated for midfielders.
In the present study, no difference was detected between groups
regarding this PMSL Factor. This may have occurred due to
the fact that, in the present category (U-15), unlike adult
categories examined in other studies, players had little specialization for
each function to be performed in the field. However, this
factor was found to be present after the defeats even
though its presence value was reduced compared to the Match
values.
