After this, the first “Dentures in One Day/DSEI Bahia” campaign
was organized, with a duration of five days of activities.
During the period, the dentures were made in a clinical
environment assembled at the Cultural Center, where five pairs of
dentists from DSEI Bahia worked, using portable equipment and school
tables. Laboratory services were performed by two dental dentures technicians,
who worked in an attached mini laboratory. The team had
three indigenous oral health assistants, who were responsible for organizing
the environment and sterilizing the instruments.
