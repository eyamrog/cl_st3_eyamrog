The fifth discourse I identify is the indivisible security discourse
(example 2). It is manifest through the indirect reported speech
(“redet von”), which cursorily introduces the safety guarantees that Russia
has demanded based on the norm of indivisible security agreed
by OSCE countries in the Helsinki Final Act and again
in the Paris Charter. Scholz does not refer to those
treaties but gives Putin’s demand a vague, unclear and personalised
character through the formulation reden von, thus not just undermining
its validity rhetorically but also placing the discourse on the
level of the proximal already-spoken rather than the distal already-spoken.
This is a dialogic expansion by distancing, followed by the
combination of countering and pronouncement “Tatsächlich aber” to suggest that
Putin is untruthful and Scholz knows what the real intention
is.
