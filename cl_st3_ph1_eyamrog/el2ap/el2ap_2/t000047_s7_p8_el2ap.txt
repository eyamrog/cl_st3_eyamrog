That being said, the present study is a contribution to
modal activities in communicative environments. The goal is to exemplify
the concept of mode as functional in various devices and
settings in copresence of a semiotic configuration. In other words,
this research elucidates the interconnection of modal components as to
how the devices generate different affordances in order to produce
and dissipate meaning potential to the target audience. As demonstrated
latter, Halliday and Matthiessen ‘s (2014) expertise, Kress and van
Leeuwen’s (2021) penetration, Baldry and Thibault (2010), and Norris’ (2019)
perspectives serve as the tools of analyzing modes, tending towards
the application of conceptual frameworks to a semiotic system of
a New Oral-B Toothpaste advertisement (henceforth: ad).
