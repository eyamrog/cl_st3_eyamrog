Transmission of ACL south of the Amazon River system is
poorly understood [8,9]. Although it has often been stated that
human Leishmania infection is either rare or absent south of
the Negro and Amazon Rivers [8,10], the incidence of leishmaniasis
in humans in some of these areas is equivalent to
the incidence at north of the Negro and Amazon Rivers
[9,11]. Guerra et al. (2011) [12] described the epidemiology of
mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) south of the Amazon River, and not
only found a high prevalence of this form of the
disease, but also a distribution of Leishmania species similar to
the distribution found north of the Amazon River. However, the
etiologic agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) has not been identified,
and the source of sylvatic infection and the vectors involved
in transmission are not known south of the Amazon River
system [8,13].
