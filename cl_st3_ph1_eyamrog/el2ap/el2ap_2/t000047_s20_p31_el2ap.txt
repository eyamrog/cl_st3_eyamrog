Drawing on Table 2, there are four HLMA segments that
Oral-B video displays. That orientation influences the calibration of the
HLMA frequency (horizontal) in Table 3. As illustrated in Figure
11, the social actors of HLMA 1 construct weightiest grammatical
components of 21 than any other phase. HLMA 4 and
HLMA 2 employ 10 components each to sensitize the target
audience into consumption. Less linguistic components of six operate in
the sphere of HLMA 3. The calibration infers that the
advertising practitioner considers using more words at the introductory and
concluding remarks of the communication than any other aspect. In
that sense, HLMA 2 and HLMA 3 are more of
images, colors, and sounds than speeches.
