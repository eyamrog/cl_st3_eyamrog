These categories will allow us to find possibilities and the
relevance that gestures can contribute to the teaching process through
research already carried out in the classroom and at different
levels of education. The first category shows us how the
gestures, both of teachers and students, can help students in
their knowledge construction, that is, through gestures, students can express
themselves and understand differently from the usual concepts that are
abstract or not so close to their daily life. The
second and third categories help us to see how the
analysis of non-verbal communication, the gestures, of students and teachers,
is relevant to the teaching and learning process. It is
through analysis that it is possible to understand their questions,
their understanding, and other situations to improve teaching.
