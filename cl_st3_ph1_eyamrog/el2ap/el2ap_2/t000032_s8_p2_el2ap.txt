Engelmann (1986, p. 121) define mood states as a “fundamental
patterns of general functioning and orientation”, representing “the effect upon
a person of his own configuration of activity”, approaching what
is understood as feeling in everyday language (Bueno & Souza,
2019; Engelmann, 1986). Altough the relevance to investigate the subjective
athletes’ experience presupone the study of a wide range of
states, there are a primacy in investigations of negative aspects
such as depression, anxiety and stress, mainly because these aspects
could have a detrimental effect upon sports performance (Frame &
Reichin, 2019; Rocha & Osório, 2018).
