Modi paid little attention to these social disparities and to
stigmatization while implementing social distancing and quarantine rules. In the
second half of March 2020, by which time the virus
had spread to thirteen of the 28 states, Modi announced
a nationwide, European- style lockdown. The government made home-quarantine mandatory
for all incoming travelers from overseas, announced a three-week national
lockdown and suspended all inter-state trains and buses.29 The announcement
was celebrated abroad. Admittedly, it is noteworthy that the lives-versus-livelihoods
argument was invoked less in India relative to Brazil.30 However,
Modiâ€™s lockdown was still problematic. It was abruptly announced, hastily
prepared, used little testing, provided insufficient temporary shelters for migrant
workers and resorted to HCQ as a prophylaxis for healthcare
workers. Moreover, the historical problem of conflict between state and
central government authorities during epidemics only exacerbated.31 This resulted in
accusations against Modi as an authoritarian ruler.32
