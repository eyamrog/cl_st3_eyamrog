- Law of Civil Responsibility for Labor Compensation: in addition
to the eviction law, which, once the requirements for compensation
and evictions have been regularized, the law of civil responsibility
for labor compensation was enacted. In this legal body, compensation
was tied to the seriousness of the case due to
a work accident (Albornoz 1931).
