While Uliana (2013)’s work focuses on tactile resources, Oliveira and
Reily (2014) explore audible materials through the teaching of music
for blind students. Based on Pring and Ockelford (2005), Oliveira
and Reily (2014) explain that “there is a strong relationship
between the development of language, cognitive and motor skills of
the individual in an environment favorable to musical contact” (OLIVEIRA;
REILY, 2014, p. 408), which contribute for the education of
both sighted and non-sighted students. As ideas for didactic materials
for blind students, the authors mention playful activities that arise
the interest of such students in the contents, as well
as embossed materials, use of Braille, voice synthesizer, screen reader
and other technologies that contribute to this student’s learning. Also,
Oliveira and Reily (2014) highlight the importance of the incentive
coming from the students’ family, teachers and community to stimulate
their education.
