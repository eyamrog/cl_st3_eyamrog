- “characteristic” situations and meetings due to the presence of
data that deviate from the general trend of a certain
group. In groups A and B there are meetings in
which particular situations emerge from some data. In group B,
for example, there was a sharp drop in the second
meeting in the manifestation of verbal communication methods, in the
social dimension and in the percentage of time dedicated to
scientific conduct. Likewise, another fact that is highlighted is represented
by a very high percentage of time devoted to scientific
activities in the fourth meeting (B = 87%) which will
be analyzed in relation to the role of the adult.
In group A, starting from the second meeting, there are
more complex scientific behaviours (see section 4.2). This situation is
not observed in group C because the children seem to
remain in a situation in which they do not activate
more complex epistemic behaviours, verbal communicative modalities and more collaborative
social interactions.
