the local level involve other actors, such as bureaucrats with
managerial positions, NGO presidents, and entities that work in this
same policy area. Her adviser also stated that their office

a deliberate effort to relieve or downplay the role of
local politicians as mediators and establish a more direct relationship
with voters.
