The audio-visual materials were fundamental because they allowed the researchers
to re- watch the meetings numerous times and notice more
and more peculiarities each time. Moreover, they facilitated the inclusion
of other observers in the analysis phase, especially the process
supervisors. The involvement of the supervisors aimed both at avoiding
any subjectivity influence and including different perspectives that enriched the
analysis of the materials collected. The documentation of the process
and its re-examination in itinere allowed the researchers to identify
critical points and the necessity, sometimes, to take a step
back and reflect on the intervention. The study on the
materials also permitted the outlining of analysis tables to describe
the scientific attitudes shown by the children, and the strategies
and actions perpetrated by the adult to develop thinking processes,
coherently with the ‘promotion from within’ approach. The above-cited actions
are part of the idea of evaluation explained in the
premise, a sort of evaluation that “procede, accompagna e segue”
(Indicazioni Nazionali, 2012, p.19) the learning process. The researchers and
supervisors analyzed the recordings, following this perspective, and they managed
to describe some scientific attitudes shown by the children and
some of the strategies implemented by the adult.
