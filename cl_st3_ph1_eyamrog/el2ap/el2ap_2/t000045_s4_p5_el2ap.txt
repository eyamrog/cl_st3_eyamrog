Consistent with studies carried out in Brazil and the comparative
literature, we observed that cooperation between state representatives and local
brokers seems worthwhile for both sides, notwithstanding the risks they
imply. We claim that one should not approach these risks
as dilemmas typical of principal-agent models. We find no support
for the thesis of an inherent conflict of objectives between
the participants, especially when dealing with brokers who hold elective
office or have held it in the past. We also
point out that although there is information asymmetry between the
participants, this does not invariably benefit agents or brokers. Thus,
without evidence to support the fundamental assumptions of these theories,
we highlight their limits to describe and analyze the relationships
studied here. Thus, we propose that principal- agent theories should
not be taken as the primary analytical framework for thinking
about these relationships. It can be helpful as a heuristic
tool since it is employed not as “superior- subordinate dyads”
(Waterman and Meier, 1998) but with more flexibility, considering that
actors are involved in multiple relationships simultaneously, at different levels
and temporalities. It is also important to consider that these
relationships occur in different contexts that impact levels of uncertainty,
informational asymmetry, dependence between participants, and the degree to which
interests and goals converge or not. Thus, elements usually taken
as universal assumptions should be treated as variables (Waterman and
Meier, 1998). This means considering that these relationships’ dynamics may
vary depending on factors such as the size of the
municipality, proximity to the election, degree of electoral competition, levels
of party system institutionalization, potential size of brokerage networks, among
others.
