Uliana’s research (2013) also brings helpful contributions with the proposal
of a pedagogical kit. The author mentions some important characteristics
to take into consideration when composing adapted materials: they must
be cheap (such as magnets, metal plates, EVE, paper, glue
and polystyrene), easy to carry (that is, not too heavy
nor too big) and also uncomplicated to assemble and disassemble
the pieces in different ways (in order to form various
figures and graphical representations). Thus, based on other research, Uliana
(2013, p. 598) explains that, when they have access to
concrete tactile materials, “blind students are able to abstract much
information [...] at the same level as a sighted student
does”. In addition, the author reports that it is not
necessary to promote drastic changes in the teaching methods, but
a few adaptations to encompass the blind students’ needs too.
