We can even speculate that in a context of strong
electoral competition, such as the Brazilian one, the value of
loyalty increases (while disloyalty is not exemplarily punished) because it
brings predictability to the legislator about her “safe” electoral assets.
This does not mean that, from a representatives’ point of
view, investing in brokers is irrational. In line with what
Hicken and Nathan (2020) propose, this may reflect their perception
that, even in the face of all the risks and
the impossibility of adequately sanctioning brokers, legislators depend on them
to build their reputation in the municipalities. Furthermore, widespread expectations
among voters may lead representatives to nurture relationships with brokers,
fearing that they will have their place taken by their
opponents if they do not. Concerning informational asymmetry, principals may
also develop strategies to reduce their dependence on local brokers.
For example, they can implement forms of direct communication with
their constituencies and pursue independent information from other partners.
