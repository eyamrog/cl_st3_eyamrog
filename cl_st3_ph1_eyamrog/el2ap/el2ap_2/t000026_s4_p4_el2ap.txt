This study presents some limitations that should be considered. The
first is the cross-sectional design, which prevents conclusions about cause-and-effect
relationships. Another limitation is the small sample size, which may
affect the representativeness of the results. However, the data obtained
may be useful for future longitudinal studies, despite the limitation
of sample size. In addition, the use of a self-
administered questionnaire may generate memory bias and interpretation of questions
by participants. The sample is also limited in terms of
types of higher education institutions, with low representativeness of public
and community universities.
