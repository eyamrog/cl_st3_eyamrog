ABA Farm is located in an area which is considered
by MMA (2002) as of high biological importance in the
Caatinga, placed in the mountain complex also named Aba after
the river that crosses this geologic mountain complex. The totality
of its area presents many phytophysiognomies with mountains up to
800 m high and dense well-preserved tree-shrub caatinga associated to
riparian forest, rupiculous flora and open fields. Among these areas
riparian forests, open fields with the presence of exotic species
and montane vegetation can be found (MMA 2002).
