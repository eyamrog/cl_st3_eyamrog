Students can be encouraged to gesture when they explain a
problem. The gestures that students produce will probably demonstrate their
understanding of the evolution of the problem, which is not
yet evident in their speech. These gestures can then serve
as a diagnosis that teachers can use to find out
what their students know and what they are ready to
learn.
