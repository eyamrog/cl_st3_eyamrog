Although Modi and Bolsonaro had different attitudes towards lockdowns, both
pinned hopes on radical assumptions about herd-immunity based on attitudes
which dehumanize large sectors of the constituent populations. As applied,
the concept of herd immunity presented disturbing necropolitical implications; it
postulated that the death of a large number of “expendable”
people was actually necessary and normal. The communities that served
as victims included Amazonian Indigenous people and poor Afro-Brazilians in
Brazil, and, in India, the Muslim minority, Dalits and migrant
workers.38 The Brazilian and Indian federal governments proposed vaccines as
a quick-fix solution, without intervention in the underlying problems of
basic living conditions. This revealed an initially covert necropolitical posture
on the part of the state. Regrettably, later, once the
number of cases and deaths declined, this posture became normalized.
Consequently, it is clear that political responses to the COVID-19
crisis actually served to exacerbate and to a process of
invisibilization of the ongoing historical reality of racism and discrimination.
