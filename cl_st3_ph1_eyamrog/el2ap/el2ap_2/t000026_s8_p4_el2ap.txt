It is in this sense that it is clarified that
anxiety can be understood in two different ways: trait anxiety
and state anxiety. In the university space, trait anxiety is
understood as a stable personality characteristic (Machado et al., 2016),
which predisposes the student to perceive the university as threatening
and dangerous, causing levels of anxiety disproportionate to the situation
(Balapala & Indla, 2017). On the other hand, state anxiety
is characterized as a transient emotional state (Machado et al.,
2016) that generates symptoms such as nervousness, worry, and apprehension
related to the excitement felt in this environment (Gama et
al., 2021).
