This study analyzed the correlation of anxiety and use of
anxiolytics among university students in the health area. The main
findings showed that 58.8% of the students investigated reported the
use of anxiolytic drugs, with most of the sample being
veterans. The presence of anxious symptoms leads students to seek
quick solutions to deal with the overload of curricular activities,
including the use of medications (Nogueira et al., 2021; PÃ©rez
et al., 2023).
