As challenging as teaching an additional language to a blind
student may be, it is also a rewarding experience, as
both student and teacher will learn through the joint construction
of different knowledge. In this two-way path, students may feel
more confident and succeed, one day at a time, in
learning a new language, while the EAL teacher will discover
different materials and learn a bit each day on how
to cope with a blind student in class.
