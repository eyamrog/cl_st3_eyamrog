Teachers and managers of a school unit of the State
School System understood health by the perspective of well-being, having
links with an expanded conception, overcoming aspects centered on the
natural sciences. However, this understanding seems to be still limited
to the individual plan of the students. The study also
demonstrated that the discourse about body practices as a link
between physical education and health at school is still hegemonic.
