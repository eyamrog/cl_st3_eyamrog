In the category “Mental health,” teacher Larissa sees a relation
between PE and health based on the development of coexistence,
since it is a heterogeneous group. Besides being a welcoming
perspective of diversity, the teacher refers to the contribution of
PE as a socializing curricular component, a limit pointed out
by Bracht et al. (2003). Regarding students’ social realities, also
present in the discourse of teacher Larissa, students’ exposure to
a risky behavior is notorious. Likewise, Zappe and Dell’anglio (2016)
identified that the negative perception of relation at school and
in the family, in addition to poor performance, demotivation and
dissatisfaction with the school, contribute to changes in behavior, as
stressful events that may compromise students’ mental health. Thus, the
teacher emphasizes the heterogeneity of profiles of students that attend
the school unit, highlighting the group with greater exposure and
possibility of adhering to a risky behavior.
