â€¦ another important achievement is the relative minimum wage. The
lack of legal fixation of the same, was a vacuum
that had to be filled urgently... after long investigations it
was possible to indicate the minimum wage in one sucre
per day in the mountains, and two, on the coast.
(Guerrero 1937:22-23)
