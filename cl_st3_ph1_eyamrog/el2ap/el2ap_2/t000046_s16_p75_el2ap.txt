In short, we agree with Bracht (2013) on a pedagogical
work directed to listening and creation of bonds that allow
the exposure of students to an ideal of happiness, being
able to elucidate a path based on body practices, so
health can be an effect of the choices and actions.
This characteristic corroborates Carmo Júnior (2011, p.365), because “[...] the
body and the world form a single structure; however, we
can only make this communion visible if we articulate the
senses and, to do so, we have to see the
universe from other angles and forms.” Thus, we understand that
the student is in the school for being subjected to
pedagogical actions, and, in these mediations, there should be a
significant learning, in the case of our study, towards health.
