On the “Way to English/Way to Go!” website13, the authors
provide some complementary materials available to English language teachers, such
as flashcards, worksheets, tests, educational videos and songs, indicating the
textbook, the unit and the content with which each of
them can be used. Although songs and listening activities could
be applied in classes with blind students, we could not
find materials referring specifically to that audience on the website.
