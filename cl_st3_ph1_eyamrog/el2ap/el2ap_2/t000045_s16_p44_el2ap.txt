We note that only a minority of the staff members
worked at the ground level â€“ contrary to what Carvalho
(2003) identified for national representatives. This is probably because state
assemblies are closer to the non-capital municipalities. Moreover, since a
large part of local requests is related to bureaucratic procedures
involving Executive branch agencies, it seems more appropriate to keep
most of the staff at the headquarters, where they have
easier access to these structures.
