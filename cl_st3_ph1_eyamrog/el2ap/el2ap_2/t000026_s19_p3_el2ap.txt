When analyzing the comparison of the use of anxiolytic drugs
according to the type of university and sex (Table 3),
a higher frequency of anxiolytic drug use was observed among
female students (42.3%) and those attending public universities (55.3%). In
addition, there was a statistically significant association between the type
of university and the use of anxiolytic drugs (p=0.042), but
not between sex and the use of anxiolytics.
