The implementation of changes in wages as changes in the
labor legal systems came along with some populism governments, after
the Great Depression, many politicians saw the opportunity to use
it as a platform for their agendas: on the one
hand, this agenda involved some adaptation of socialism; on the
other hand, it involved some adaptation of Keynesian economic models.
In all cases, populism was the main characteristic, so there
were the cases of Lázaro Cárdenas in Mexico (1934-1940), Getulio
Vargas in Brazil (1930-1943), Juan Domingo Perón in Argentina (1943-
1955) (Zapata 2002). In Ecuador, the first populist government of
Velasco Ibarra (1934-1935). In following decades, there is a clear
change in the highland hacienda: the elimination of the Huasipungo
system and the establishment of salary relationships. Moving to the
center and north of Ecuador, there was an increasing coexistence
of haciendas and smallholdings combining the business economy with the
peasant economy this due to agrarian transformations that have converted
the peasant from possessor to owner, the landowner initiative: the
patron-peasant was replaced by the employer-worker relation (Salamea 1980).
