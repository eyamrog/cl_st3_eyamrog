Meanwhile, vaccination was a political opportunity for Doria. He promised
to deliver vaccines not only to São Paulo but also
to the rest of the country. Vaccines had a greater
appeal in January 2021 when the effects of Brazilians ignoring
social distancing during the New Year celebrations became clear. At
the time, a new variant of COVID-19 hit Manaus, the
biggest city in the Amazon region and where approximately 40%
of residents live without piped water and suffer from a
lack of hospitals and medical supplies. Even for supporters of
herd immunity the outbreak was a serious cause for concern.
Epidemiologists estimated that the infection rate in Manaus in the
wake of the city’s first outbreak in March 2020 was
as high as 76%, and since they assumed prior infection
led to immunity, they concluded that a sudden explosion was
unlikely.23 In fact, not only was the new variant of
the virus more contagious, it was also able to infect
people who had already recovered from other variants. By the
end of February 2021, cases of the new variant had
been reported in 21 of 26 Brazilian states.
