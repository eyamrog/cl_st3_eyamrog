The rehabilitation with dental prostheses of Indigenous people edentulous put
in villages has been a challenge for the institutions responsible
for Indigenous health care in view of the difficult logistics
of displacement of Indigenous people to urban centers. Retrospective observational
study. Nineteen edentulous indigenous people were rehabilitated by the simplified
technique “Prosthesis in one day”. Before making the prosthesis (t0),
the patients were submitted to a clinical examination and interview
for the application of the OHIP-14. Prostheses Adjustments prostheses were
made when necessary. After one year (t1), a new interview
was conducted and in addition to questionnaires to assess the
quality of life, one was applied to evaluate the perception
of quality, comfort and chewing ability in relation to the
prostheses. There was a significant decrease in oral health impact
on patients' quality of life in all OHIP-14 domains (median
t0 = 33.0; median t1 = 0.0; effect size =
4.69). In general, the scores given by patients for the
upper and lower dentures were high after one year of
use. There was a positive impact on chewing. The “Prosthesis
in 1 day” technique proved to be a good alternative
for the rehabilitation of villagers, positively impacting their quality of
life.
