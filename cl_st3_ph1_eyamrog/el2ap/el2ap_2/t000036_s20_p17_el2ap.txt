In this way, it can be understood that, from 1929
to 1932, Ecuador grew an annual average of 0.6%. However,
during the recovery period, this part of the population became
a heavy burden because it did not generate more production:
after the impact of the international crisis, the recovery process
was very slow compared to the rest of the Latin
American region. From 1932 to 1939, Ecuador grew an annual
average of 3.5% while Latin America grew an average of
5% (Naranjo 2017).
