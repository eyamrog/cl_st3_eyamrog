The axiomatic quality of mode influences extant literature in multimodal
discourse domains such as O’Toole’s (1994) comprehension, Kress and van
Leeuwen’s (2021) thought, and Scollon’s (1998, 2001) interactional sensitivity. Besides,
Scollon’s impressive perception that is a bit ethnographically different. Halliday’s
systemic functional linguistics operates as the strength, stronghold, and basis
for the exemplification of mode, as the agent of meaning-
making in communication. As Constantinou (2005) focuses on modes’ depiction
in media techniques and Silvestre (2008) maps emotion in multimodal
messages, Cambria, Arizzi and Coccetta (2012), van Leeuwen and Jewitt
(2001), and Adami (2015a) explain practical affordances in web tools,
meaning in social semiotic entities as well as expedients of
interactivity in the website as a context. The discursive offerings
of Ly and Jung (2015) and Holsanova (2016) rest on
modal design of advertising systems and procedures of exploring integrative
communication elements.
