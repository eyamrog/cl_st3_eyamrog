In 2017, Aizawa, Giordan, and Silva published their research with
graduate students in their mandatory undergraduate internships. Using the technique
of Video-Stimulated Remembrance, the students were filmed when they taught
their classes, and, afterward, they analyzed their gestures through the
categories of Kendon (2004). The results of this research point
out that the undergraduates “developed both a gestural and multimodal
perception, that is, they became aware of what was said,
of the positioning of the body and hands so that
in the future they can modify their actions with the
main objective of producing meanings. ” (Aizawa, Giordan, & Silva,
2017).
