Given the high number of requests they receive from municipalities,
how do the offices establish priorities? The interviews suggest that
legislators balance two criteria: a need to favor the largest
number of local partners and ensure that resources are tangible
for the population and enough to carry out public works.
The most vital is to ensure that the benefit has
impact and visibility, which requires a greater volume of resources
the larger a city is. In larger cities, according to
one interviewee, “it will be very scattered” or, as another
one put it, it may become grounds for criticism (allocating
too few resources to a large city).
