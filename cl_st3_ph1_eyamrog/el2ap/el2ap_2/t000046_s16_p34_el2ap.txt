In the category “Balance,” health is understood as a corporeal
manifestation, suggesting a Cartesian view of the individual and reinforcing
the actions in the body itself, corroborating a restricted conception.
Silva, Silva and Lüdorf (2015) verified that the body, as
a subject in PE classes, has not been systematically discussed;
only occasionally generating topics of discussion, such as health practices
and habits.
