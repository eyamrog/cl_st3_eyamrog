Those adaptation suggestions are only a few examples for approaches
to teach a blind student, but there are many other
adapted didactic materials that may be valuable to research and
implement in their education. For instance, texts in Braille (OLIVEIRA;
REILY, 2014), recorded audios (CAMARGO; NARDI, 2006), debates (CAMARGO; NARDI,
2006) and description of images and graphs (FERREIRA; DICKMAN, 2015)
may also be helpful and stimulating activities when teaching blind
students.
