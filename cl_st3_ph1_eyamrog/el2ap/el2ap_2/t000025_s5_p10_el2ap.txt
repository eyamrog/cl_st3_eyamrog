Antimicrobial substances, including honey, Octenidine, polyhexanide, and metronidazole, showed promising
results in MFW-related pain management through decreasing local microbial load
which is responsible for triggering pain as a classic indicator
of infection (Swanson & Angel, 2022). In addition, the progressive
nature of cancer makes MFWs sensitive to microbial growth, mainly
with anaerobic microorganisms causing wound odor, exudate, and pain. Thus,
the control of the microbial burden of MFWs through topical
antimicrobial substances can explain the reduction of exudate, odor, and
pain (Vardhan et al., 2019 ; Villela-Castro et al. 2018;
Finlayson et al., 2017b;).
