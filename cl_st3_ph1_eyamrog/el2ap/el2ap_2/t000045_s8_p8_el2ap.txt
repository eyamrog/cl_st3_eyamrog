Based on our findings, we highlight the need to: (i)
further explore the differences between local brokers who hold and
do not hold elective mandates, and between state and national
representatives in terms of local ties; (ii) differences and connections
between the dynamics of intermediation occured during elections and those
that go beyond the electoral campaigns; (iii) explore other methods
of broker selection, besides parties (more commonly studied on the
Brazilian case).
