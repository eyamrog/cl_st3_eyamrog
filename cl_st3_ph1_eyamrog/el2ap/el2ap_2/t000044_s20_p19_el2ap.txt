In Brazil, in 2014, Mortimer et al. investigated how two
university teachers mobilized different semiotic modes and promoted interaction between
them for the construction of meanings in Chemistry class. After
the teachers were recorded while teaching their classes, they were
analyzed. The analysis showed that each teacher uses and articulates
different semiotic modes, such as speech, gestures, drawings on the
board, being these means to communicate with students. The research
identified that these semiotic modes and, in particular, gestures, contribute
to the construction of meanings in the classroom.
