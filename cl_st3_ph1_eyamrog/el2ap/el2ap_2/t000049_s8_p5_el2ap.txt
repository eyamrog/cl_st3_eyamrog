This type of evaluation requires a careful and systematic observation
in order to distinguish the abilities and skills the child
already possesses from those he is acquiring. These potentials need
to be acknowledged and consolidated to orient the choices and
educational intervention necessary to encourage their already-in-motion growth within the
children. The teacher has the duty to support (scaffolding), encourage,
and facilitate their harmonious development. These evaluation procedures need to
consider the childrenâ€™s ordinary experiences and convince the teacher to
focus on the process while taking responsibility for their chosen
educational method, recognizing the successes and failures. The meaning of
educational evaluation regarding the developmental processes and progress made by
the children is explained from this perspective.
