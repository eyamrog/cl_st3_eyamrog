These data can be used to address challenges in leishmaniases
control and to a better understanding of the epidemiology of
this disease. Since control measures in Brazil are based on
disease surveillance and monitoring in territorial units, which include biological
and environmental characteristics, our dataset can contribute to a broader
knowledge. Our data provide occurrence records from previously unknown which
would not normally be surveyed by the public health system
ACL control programmes from the Brazilian government. These data can
be used for modelling of both vector and disease distribution
in space and time as well as provide clues on
priority areas for ACL surveillance and control in these areas.
