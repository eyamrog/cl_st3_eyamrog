The above-cited concepts allow considering evaluation as a research process
where teachers, sharing values and pedagogical principles, theorize development paths
that observe, document, and evaluate. These processes aim at permitting
to re-analyze the experience and identify improvements both in the
methods (observation, documentation) and the different perspectives. From this point
of view, evaluation is not a unidirectional process (the teacher
judges the children, or the researcher evaluates the results of
his inquiry), but it is characterized by an intertwining of
layers that influence one another. This idea of evaluation as
a research process requires the teacher to adopt flexible and
participative strategies of intervention, not based on preconceptions but on
the possibility to question their educational and didactic approach while
furthering the children’s everyday experience, their curiosity, differences, and variety
of personal answers. The opportunity to discuss the adult’s choices
to offer an educational environment that promotes thinking processes requires
the ability to abandon certainties and expose oneself to the
emotionally challenging situation of uncertainty (Bion, 1973). This aspect involves
a certain amount of anxiety that must be managed in
order not to give in to the temptation to find
'pre-packaged' solutions.
