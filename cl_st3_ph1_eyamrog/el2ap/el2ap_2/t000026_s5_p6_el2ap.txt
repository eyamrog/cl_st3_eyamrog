Another important result of this research was that, compared to
male participants, female participants showed higher levels of moderate state
anxiety. Recent research suggests that state anxiety in female university
students is related to transient anxiety, which varies according to
emerging stimuli from their academic experiences and can cause temporary
negative emotional states (Deer et al., 2018; Thomas & Cassady,
2021).
