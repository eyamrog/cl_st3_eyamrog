As mentioned in the previous section, it was difficult to
find previous studies about didactic materials for Brazilian blind students
when generating data for the Review of Literature, so much
so none of the articles address EAL language materials. However,
that lack of research on materials for blind students does
not seem to be a problem exclusively related to the
English language field as other research from our review indicated
the same difficulty in the Physics (FERREIRA; DICKMAN, 2015) and
Music (OLIVEIRA; REILY, 2014) fields, for example, and the necessity
of deepening on the issue. Such data indicate a research
gap in many educational fields and the need to learn
from our colleagues and special educators how to include and
adapt materials of all school disciplines for blind students.
