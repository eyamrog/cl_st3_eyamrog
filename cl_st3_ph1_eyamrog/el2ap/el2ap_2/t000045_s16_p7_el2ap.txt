Our evidence also points out that city councilors are relevant
supports, albeit less than mayors. Almost 24% of respondents in
the 2007 wave said that support from local councilors was
important to their victory (5.7% in the first, 18.3% in
the second), and just over 18% did so in the
2012 wave (4.3% in the first, 14.1% in the second).
In the aggregate, 50.3% of respondents in 2007 mentioned mayors
or councilors as one of the two most important endorsements.
This figure was lower in the 2012 wave, 40.1%.9
