To analyse how power is exercised through discursive struggle, Baxter
(2011) adopts Bakhtin’s concept of centripetal (centralising) and centrifugal (decentralising)
forces (BAKHTIN, 1981, p.270–272). Marginalised discourses are “easily forgotten or
silenced relative to what is centred. The centre is easily
legitimated as normative, typical, and natural” and serves as a
benchmark against which all else is compared, a position of
privilege and, thus, power compared to the centrifugal (BAXTER, 2011,
p.123). I understand power in a Foucauldian sense as something
that needs to be explained, not assumed as a condition
of society (PENNYCOOK, 2021). Power thus “resides in the systems
of meaning – the discourses – through which social reality
as we know it is constructed” (BAXTER, 2011, p.124), not
in individuals or social groups. Centripetal discourses are more powerful
than centrifugal ones because their systems of meaning are presented
as social reality (BAXTER, 2011, p.124). By means of discourses,
we exercise power to use language to produce reality rather
than just reflect it, producing “domains of objects and rituals
of truth” (FOUCAULT, 1979, p.194). In Bakhtinian terms, “social life
and historical becoming” create within languages “a multitude of concrete
worlds, a multitude of bounded verbal-ideological and social belief systems”
(BAKHTIN, 1981, p.288), so that “we only have access to
competing accounts of the truth” (PENNYCOOK, 2021, p.112). A Bakhtinian
understanding of languages as worldviews and discursive struggle thus entails
the position that meaning- making always takes place within relations
of power and that there is no truth outside of
power.
