This section concerns the exploratory research about previous studies on
adaptation of didactic materials for blind students. In that research,
different Applied Linguistics journal websites were consulted, but we could
not find any results searching for keywords such as “blind”,
“blind students” and “blindness” (in English and in Portuguese languages).
Such data reinforce the importance of studies regarding adaptation of
materials for blind students, which help to assist teachers on
regular classes to include those students in all didactic activities.
