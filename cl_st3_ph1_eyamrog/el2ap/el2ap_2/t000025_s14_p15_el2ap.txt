Extracted data included general data regarding the author(s), year of
publication, origins, objectives, methods, topical therapies used, and results. In
addition, specific data regarding tumor type, staging, wound location and
stage, pain evaluation with an assessment tool, pain classification, location
and duration of pain, and the use of medication to
control wound pain were extracted. The authors of one of
the included articles were contacted to request additional data (Ciałkowska-Rysz
& Dzierżanowski, 2019). As seen in the methodology of scoping
reviews, a critical evaluation of the included articles was not
carried out.
