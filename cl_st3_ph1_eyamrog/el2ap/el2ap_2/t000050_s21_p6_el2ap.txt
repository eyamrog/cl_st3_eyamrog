The Wajãpi organize themselves into autonomous local groups, called "iwanã-ko",
which are represented by a local group that has its
origin in a specific region, where there are several villages.
But not all the people of an “iwanã-ko” live in
the same region, because when marriages between people from different
groups take place, one of the spouses starts living in
the other's region [20], which may represent only a temporary
physical settlement. The different groups occupy three spatial categories: the
places of concentration – rural villages / dwellings; intermittent dispersal/settlements
(mainly during the dry season – hunting, fishing and gathering
camps) and "koo kwerã" sites which are wildlife reserves and
are left undisturbed for wild animals to use and therefore,
be hunted. This combination of social, political and ecological factors
that determine the movements of concentration and dispersion of the
Wajãpi in its territory seems to accompany the patterns of
disease distribution in the TIW, so that the tendency to
concentrate families close to the Perimetral Norte highway, which reaches
TIW, seems to be related to the increased incidence of
infectious diseases [16,21].
