The aim of this study is to present adaptations for
didactic activities of the most used textbook in Santa Maria,
RS, in 2021, used by sixth graded blind students. To
do so, a Review of Literature was conducted, regarding previous
works on teaching and learning process of blind students. Based
on the results of this research, an adaptation of selected
didactic activities headed to blind students is then suggested. Before
discussing those forms of adaptations, we present, in the following
sections, the national inclusion of the non-sighted people in social
and educational contexts by debating some historical perspectives on national
legislation and historical landmarks, as well as the main perspectives
on the teaching of blind students.
