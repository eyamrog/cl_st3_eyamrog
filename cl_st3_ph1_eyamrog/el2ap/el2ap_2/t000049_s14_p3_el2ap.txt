One of the main aims of this research, following the
previously mentioned studies, was identifying the best environment to promote
and favor a scientific analysis of the natural behaviors in
children of preschool age. In particular, it refers to kindergarten
children. The educational styles proposed by the teachers strongly influence
the environmental factor, therefore, they are also examined in the
research. This also has the secondary aim of studying if
and in what measure children belonging to the same educational
context, age group (4- and 5-year-old), and subject to the
same free experimentation of ‘stimulating tools’ manifested the same set
of skills and range of scientific attitudes, after experiencing different
teaching styles.
