Chue, Lee, and Tan (2015) conducted their research in higher
education in the discipline of Chemistry in Singapore. Their research
sought, first, to conduct a brief review of the literature
on communication and education, to articulate possible contributions of iconic
gestures in science education. Then, they analyzed the iconic gestures
performed by a university professor when exemplifying abstract concepts, such
as size, position, and movement of particles. The researchers suggest
that iconic gestures may illuminate aspects of abstract scientific meaning,
being a more complete version of meaning than just speech.
