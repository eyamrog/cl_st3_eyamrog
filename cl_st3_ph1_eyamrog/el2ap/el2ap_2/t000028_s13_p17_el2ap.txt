The lack of research in the educational area affects the
classroom context, since there is not enough widely available guidance
for teachers to adapt printed materials for blind students by
themselves. Other difficulties relate to the lack of preparation in
teacher education undergraduate courses (FERREIRA; DICKMAN, 2015; CAMARGO; NARDI, 2006;
OLIVEIRA; REILY, 2014), in which future teachers only get a
glimpse on the special education themes. Such a fact is
demonstrated in Oliveira and Reily’s research (2014). Through semi-structured interviews
with five blind music students, the authors investigated the learning
process of those students, “in order to unveil problems faced
by them regarding the access to and learning of music”
(OLIVEIRA; REILY, 2014, p. 407). One of the results indicated
a possible lack of disciplines in undergraduate courses addressing the
specificities of students with disabilities (OLIVEIRA; REILY, 2014, p. 417).
Another related example occurs in the context of teacher education
undergraduate courses of Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM), including
the English Major9, in which there is only one course
in the curriculum concerning the different spectrums of special education.
In addition, Ferreira and Dickman (2015, p. 245) cite daily
problems faced by in- service teachers, such as “violence, low
pay, indiscipline and institutional assessments”, which may interfere in the
search for continued education specialized on adaptations for impaired students.
