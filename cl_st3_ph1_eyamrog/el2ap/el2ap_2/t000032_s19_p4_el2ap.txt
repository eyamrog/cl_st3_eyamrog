Statistical analysis for the comparison of presence values between Events
and the different Series revealed temporal patterns of change both
as a function of Event and Series of Factors III
(Hope) and XI (Receptivity). This means that an interaction was
detected between Event and Series, showing that the presence values
of the PMSL Factors depended on the type of Event
and to which Series they belonged (Figure 3). The presence
values of Factor III (Hope) in TR-PRE of Series 1
were higher than those of Series 2 (p=0.001) and 3
(p=0.000) and the TR-PRE values of Series 2 were higher
than those of Series 3 (p=0.001). These data indicate a
progressive decline of Factor III (Hope) from Series to Series.
Analysis of Factor III (Hope) also showed higher presence values
in Series 1 MATCH than in Series 2 (p=0.001) and
3 MATCHES (p=0.039), revealing the same pattern of decline along
the Series of competition. Factor XI (Receptivity) showed the same
pattern of reduction of TR-PRE presence values in Series 1
compared to Series 2 (p=0.001) and 3 (p=0.000), as well
as higher presence values in Series 1 MATCHES compared to
Series 2 (p=0.005) and in Series 2 MATCHES compared to
Series 3 (p=0.028). It can be seen that Factor VII
(Interest) also showed statistically significant differences depending on Event and
Series, but no interaction between these variables.
