The purchasing power of the economically active population of Ecuador
can also be seen from the differentiation of groups. In
the first group, the one that lived from the fruits
of its agricultural and livestock production, and from the community
exchange system, its purchasing power remained stable despite the international
crisis because its commercial movement was internal and did not
depend on fluctuations in prices that occurred in the domestic
market. This sector of the population behaved as a cushion
of resistance during the international crisis because their way of
subsistence did not depend on national or international trade.
