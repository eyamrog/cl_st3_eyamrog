Searches were performed in three steps: 1. An initial search
was done on the MEDLINE and CINAHL databases using the
terms "Wounds and Injuries; Neoplasms; Pain Management; Administration, Topical" to
identify new keywords. 2. A new search was applied using
all keywords and descriptors identified in the included databases. 3.
Additionally, with the support of a librarian, a search equation
was built for each database. The search strategy for CINAHL
(EBSCO) is detailed in Table 1. No time limit was
applied in the search equations conducted from 2019 to 2020
which was then updated in March 2022. Finally, an active
search in the reference lists of selected studies was performed
to identify additional studies of interest.
