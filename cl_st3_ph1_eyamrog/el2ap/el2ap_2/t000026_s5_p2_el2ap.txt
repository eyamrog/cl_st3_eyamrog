In addition, the university is a critical environment for the
use of anxiolytic drugs and the development of problematic patterns
of consumption of these drugs (Vera et al., 2021). One
study found that 20% of senior health students use anxiolytics
daily due to anxiety before exams, difficulties in coping with
academic responsibilities, and fulfilling curricular and/or extracurricular internship activities (Fond
et al., 2019).
