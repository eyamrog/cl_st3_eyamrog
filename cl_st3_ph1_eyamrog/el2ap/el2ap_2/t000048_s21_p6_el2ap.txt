The materials from Rio de Janeiro (according to: J.M.A. Braga
7416 and F.A. Silva 103) registered flowering in February and
fruiting from February to March, a period in which we
also recorded these occurrences in the study area. It is
possible that the hottest the period of the year, the
more intensified the processes for this species are.
