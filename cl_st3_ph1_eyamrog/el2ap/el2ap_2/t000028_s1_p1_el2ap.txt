The purpose of the present work is to present adaptation
suggestions of activities from an English language textbook, to be
used by blind students in the sixth year of Basic
Education. In this qualitative research, inscribed in the area of
Applied Linguistics, we sought to provide a Review of Literature
on research about the adaptation of materials for blind students,
which comprised our previous studies. Highlights of themes approached include
the lack of research and of adapted materials for blind
students, the lack of preparation of teachers to deal with
the specificities of those students and problems in the development
of autonomy and inclusion of blind students in class. In
addition, we searched on those studies for understanding and ideas
of methodologies and adaptations of didactic materials for the proposals
developed in the English field. In a second moment, the
sixth grade English textbook most chosen by public schools in
Santa Maria in 2021, entitled “Way to English for Brazilian
Learners - 6” (FRANCO; TAVARES, 2015), was analyzed. Furthermore, the
analysis of the textbook revealed that the most relevant section
to be adapted is the “Vocabulary Corner”, which encompasses vocabulary
activities referring to all units of the book. After this
process, adaptations for six activities in the book were suggested,
built on the basis of the Literature Review, in order
to make them inclusive and accessible for blind students.
