Three (4%) studies elucidated the use of Negative Pressure Wound
Therapy (NPWT) to manage MFW-related pain. The studies were case
studies (66.6%) and non-systematic reviews (33.4%). None of the studies
focused primarily on pain management but on the general direction
of MFW-associated symptoms; however, one of the studies did not
mention the main objective. These studies analyzed data from six
patients, women aged 56 to 62, with different primary tumors
(sarcomas, breast cancer, melanoma, and sigmoid cancer). There was no
quantitative or qualitative assessment of pain in any of the
studies. Nevertheless, the studies reported an improvement in odor, exudate,
and pain, thus impacting patients' quality of life (Table 10).
