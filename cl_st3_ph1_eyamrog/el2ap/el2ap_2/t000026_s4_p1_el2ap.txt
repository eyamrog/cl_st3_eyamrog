The results of this research show that just over half
of a sample of university students in the health field
were using anxiolytic medication. There was a higher occurrence of
the use of these drugs among females and those attending
public universities. Our study also revealed that a significant portion
of university students with high trait anxiety and those with
moderate state anxiety use anxiolytic medications. These results contribute to
knowledge in the area, showing the presence of state-trait anxiety
symptoms among students and the importance of using the IDATE
for screening anxious symptoms in this population.
