The proposed quality assessment tool is divided into three sections:
Selection, Comparability and Outcomes as shown in Table 1. In
the Selection section, the tool evaluates the representativeness of the
selected cases in the SCCS/SCRI in relation to the total
cases coming from the study population, the definition of the
cases, the ascertainment of exposure and the absence of the
outcome of interest at the start of the observation period.
In the comparability section, confounding factors that vary over time
are evaluated such as age and seasonality. The study should
report if these factors were considered and if any adjustments
were made in the analysis of the results. In the
outcome section, there is evaluation of the ascertainment of the
outcome of interest, clear indication of the risk and control
periods and adequacy of the observation periods.
