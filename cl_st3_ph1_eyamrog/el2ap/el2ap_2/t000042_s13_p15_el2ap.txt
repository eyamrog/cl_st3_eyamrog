As was the case for Manaus as of late 2020,
by mid-October 2020, Indian officials speculated that India’s cities were
approaching herd immunity and the number of cases was about
to decline. However, by the first half of February 2021,
the number of new cases had declined but was not
under control, and a second wave was impending. At the
same time, expectations as to the effectiveness of an emergent
national immunization campaign were based on the assumption that herd
immunity had already been attained, and that since more than
70% of India’s population had already acquired some degree of
protection due to prior infection this large sector of the
population did not need immunization. By January 3, 2021, two
vaccines were approved: Covaxin, developed by a local pharmaceutical company
Bharat Biotech and Covishield, developed by Serum Institute of India
(SII) in collaboration with AstraZeneca and Oxford University. The national
vaccination program in India was beset with multiple ethical, legal,
and transparency-related blind spots that contributed to vaccine-hesitancy and criticism.
For example, Covaxin was granted approval only on the basis
of data from its Phase-I clinical trials.37 The vaccination-rate increased
only slowly, due to increased competition between state governments and
private hospitals for scarce resources including vaccines, ventilators, oxygen cylinders
and hospital beds, together with the government’s shift from prioritizing
individuals over the age of 50 for vaccination to inclusion
of all adults over the age of 18, implemented abruptly
and without consultation with states regarding the change in strategy.
Between January and mid-May of 2021, only 13% of the
population was vaccinated. At the same time, most non- pharmacological
interventions were abandoned.
