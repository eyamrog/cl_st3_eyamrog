This article focused on the relationships between state legislators and
local brokers. We investigated the importance and role of local
brokers for the state representatives, how they build and nurture
their partnership, and the reasons behind the eventual break-ups. We
based our analysis on survey data with state representatives and
in-depth interviews with advisors in state assemblies.
