Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to empirically derive the
factor structure of the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) (Qiu
et al. 2020). We used FACTOR, a program developed to
fit the EFA model using a variety of procedures (e
g., number of factors/components to be retained, factor and component
analysis, rotation methods) (Lorezo-Seva e Ferrando 2013). As a preliminary
analysis, the program performed SOLOMON (splitting a sample into subsamples
in factor analysis) to assess if both subsamples have a
similar common variance amount (Lorenzo-Seva 2021).
