The terms Zeitenwende, watershed, new reality and new era all
imply the absence of agency. They do not mean that
we see things differently now for some reason, as, for
instance, the term paradigm shift that I used above would,
but they sustain that things just are different now, that
we cannot but adapt to new circumstances. The German discourse
on the Russian invasion of Ukraine thus seems to construct
a perspective that explicitly relegates “us” to the passive observer’s
perspective, to those who now have to react to the
forceful loss of “yesterday’s certainties”. Such attempts to discursively exclude
the Self from any responsibility for actions of an Other
that it has been in dialogue with raise doubts, particularly
from a Bakhtinian dialogic perspective where “the position of the
observer is fundamental” (HOLQUIST, 2002, p.19). One goal of critical
discourse studies is to explain how powerful discourses reassert themselves
and how politicians use them to legitimate chosen actions as
allegedly without alternative. Bakhtin’s dialogic perspective and the notion of
centipetal and centrifugal discourses are helpful analytical tools to understand
such competition of discourses in the construction of reality to
support political aims.
