Recently, scholars started to address the relationship between local politicians
and legislators in Brazil through a theorical framework based on
brokers (Eduardo, 2016; Novaes, 2018). By adopting this framework, the
literature establishes clear foundations, premises, and observable implications of these
relationships and inserts the phenomenon into the comparative politics literature.
In the next section, we present the general outlines of
what brokers are and how these intermediation relationships work according
to such theories, as well as question their application to
the Brazilian case.
