Just like Pereira et. al. (2019), we chose to perform
two phases for the inclusion or exclusion of the selected
articles during the literature review. The first phase consisted of
reading the titles, abstracts, and keywords contained in the articles.
Then, after the criteria we established, we head to the
second phase. The second phase started by reading the integral
paper selected in the first phase and, after reading them,
classifying them according to their proximity and similarities.
