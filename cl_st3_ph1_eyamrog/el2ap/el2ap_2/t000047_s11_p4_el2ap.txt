It is important to remark that Figure 1 does not
replicate all the modes in the world. One mode might
have some units of modes (sub-modes) functional within its territory.
Some examples are human beings and dresses, an entirety of
architectural fabrications, and a car (Oâ€™Halloran & Baldry, 2011). Nevertheless,
one could say that the entry conditions of language, image,
color, and music are seemingly suffice for exposing the nature
of modes operational in many communication enterprises. Language, as reflected
in Figure 1, accommodates the spoken and written modes, with
various theoretical views, appraising their entities in linguistic domains (Kress,
2011; Yule, 2020; Jaworski & Coupland, 2016). The image, as
divide into animate and inanimate segments, has subdivisions of elucidation.
Proxemics, gesture, and gaze, as Hall (1974), Hostetter (2012), Kendon
(2015), and Antas and Gembalczyk (2018) manifest, are explored elements
of distance and gestural activities. As Martin and Zappavigna (2019)
argue that gestures are indicators of paralanguage, the deployment of
lower animals to act as human beings is what Kress
(2010) contextualizes as transduction.
