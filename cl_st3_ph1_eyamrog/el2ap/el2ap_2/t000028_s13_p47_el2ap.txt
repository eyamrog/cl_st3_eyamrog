After every two units, there are sections containing activities of
content review, which include vocabulary and grammar learned in the
two previous units. Following that, the textbook presents a section
with activities of the main vocabulary learned through the eight
units, called “Vocabulary Corner”. The next section of the book
is entitled “Language Reference in Context”, which presents activities about
the grammar acquired along the studies using authentic texts, including
discourse genres such as comic strips, posters and signs. The
subsequent pages are dedicated to Glossary, Index and Bibliography sections.
