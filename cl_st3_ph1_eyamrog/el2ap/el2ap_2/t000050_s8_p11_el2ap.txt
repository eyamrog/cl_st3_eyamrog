The SIL is very remote and our entomological survey was
performed by different teams to take advantage of routine operations
by FUNAI. A total of 1,428 sand fly specimens were
identified to either genus or species-level. Ten genera and 33
species were collected, of which the genera Trichophoromyia was predominant
(57%), followed by Psychodopygus (20%) and Nyssomyia (5%). Among the
most abundant species were T. ubiquitalis (25%), T. octavioi (9%)
and Ps. davisi (8%).
