The flowering and fruiting data were obtained through the analysis
of the exsiccates, field observations and literature. The morphological terms
followed those described in Gon√ßalves & Lorenzi (2011). The illustrations
were free hand made with the aid of a stereomicroscope
and finished by illustrator Klei Rodrigo de Sousa.
