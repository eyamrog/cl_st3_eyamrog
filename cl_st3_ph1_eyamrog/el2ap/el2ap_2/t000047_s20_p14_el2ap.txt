As shown in HLMA 4, it seems that the ladyâ€™s
witness stimulates the indexical social actors to reinvigorate the campaign
of the toothpaste, counseling viewers and the testifier to Stay
strong and Stay fresh. As a result, viewers should Stay
with the 2-IN-1 support that Oral-B provides users. Consumers ought
to be steadily abiding with the product, as their steadiness-
cum-stability will continue to maintain strong teeth and fresh breath
that endure for a long period of time. Again, at
this juncture, the image of Oral-B appears in a motion,
as indicated in three forms in O-BT30 to O-BT32. These
transcripts are significant, as demonstrators of the sparkling movement of
the whitish content of the original toothpaste as it moves
in a rolling form from a source from up down
to the labeled carton (body) of Oral-B.
