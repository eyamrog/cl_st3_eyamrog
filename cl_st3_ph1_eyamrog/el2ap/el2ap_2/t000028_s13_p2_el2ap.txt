Although this research is subscribed to the qualitative approach, it
was also necessary to adopt procedures from the quantitative approach,
which supported the analysis with quantified data organized in tables
and graphics, for example (SILVA, 2016; SANTADE, 2014). According to
Santade (2014), while quantitative research organizes numerical information through statistical
procedures, qualitative research concerns a structured and interpretative analysis of
information. Combined, such approaches help the “accuracy of the description
and analysis of the collected data”, reaching faithful authentic results
and conclusions (SANTADE, 2014, p. 102). The quantitative approach helped
us with the collection and quantification of data both in
theoretical (collecting articles to the Review of Literature) and practical
(gathering data of the sixth grade English textbooks used in
public schools of Santa Maria, RS, in 2021) moments. On
the other hand, the qualitative approach was useful to the
moment of analysis and perceptions of such data, which are
the basis for our adaptation proposal.
