Five (7%) articles reported topical honey as a therapy for
MFW-related pain management. None of the studies focused on pain
management but on the general control of MFW symptoms, including
pain. Two reviews (systematic and non-systematic) (Adderley & Holt, 2014;
Praptiwi, 2017) included two primary studies in which authors obtained
positive effects of using honey to control MFW odor, exudate,
and pain. These studies analyzed 384 patients, mainly women, with
an average age of 44 to 90 years, primarily with
breast tumors. A visual analog scale was used just in
one of the studies (Lund-Nielsen et al., 2011). (Table 8).
