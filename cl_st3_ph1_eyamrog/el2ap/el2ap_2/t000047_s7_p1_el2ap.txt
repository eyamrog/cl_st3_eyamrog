The question of the exact representation of Mode has generated
many but remarkable impulses in the knowledge-based industry. This is
because since the inception of Multimodality, elements that paint mode
have attracted several scholarly descriptions, and perhaps, with no single
consensus of a specific definition (Jewitt, 2009; Bateman, Wildfeuer &
Hiippala, 2017; Forceville, 2020). As one understands, disciplines, including multimodality,
are embodiments of concepts contextualized to fit into the knowledge
that a particular field of study drives. That perception informs
the subtle lamentation about the componential content and configuration of
the entity labeled as mode. One ought not to be
surprised about the delineation ripples for there is a need
for a crystal clear idea of the module of mode
(Kress, 2010). To my mind, such a clarification will empower
every enthusiast of multimodality to profoundly have first class information
about the focus of this broad but malleable field of
enquiry.
