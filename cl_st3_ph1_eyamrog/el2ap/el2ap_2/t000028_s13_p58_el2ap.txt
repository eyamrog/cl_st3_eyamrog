Although the adaptations suggested are construed based only in the
studies of the Review of Literature, it is necessary to
highlight the importance of the interdisciplinary work with the school
educational advisor and Special Education professionals. Such a collaboration may
give other perspectives, beyond the studies presented in this work,
and may help to come up with the best method
to deal with the specificities of each student.
