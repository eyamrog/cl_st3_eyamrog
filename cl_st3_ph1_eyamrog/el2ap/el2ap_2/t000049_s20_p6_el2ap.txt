4. Experimentation. This category includes all the conduits through which
the child acts and interacts with the material available on
the basis of a hypothesis to be verified. The discriminating
aspect in this category consists of the verbal explanation of
the hypothesis in mind and of the implementation of the
actions useful to put it to the test by observing
the effects that follow. This type of conduct develops along
a process that falls within Dewey’s theory of the investigation
process. For example, Leonardo is working in a pool of
water and suddenly says: "Look! This float (indicates a piece
of wood) but if I put this on it (a
plastic bottle full of water) it will all go down”.
