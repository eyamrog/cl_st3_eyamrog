To the best of our knowledge and after contacting two
renowned researchers in SCCS/SCRI design, it came to our knowledge
that no specific methodological assessment tool that has been reported
and validated for use in evaluating the methodology of SCCS/SCRI
designs. In 2018, Wachira and collaborators adapted the New Castle
Ottawa Scale for quality assessment of cohort studies to evaluate
SCCS study designs in their systematic review of the etiology
of Guillain-Barr√© (19,20). The present study aims at proposing a
methodological quality assessment tool that can be used in quality
assessment of SCCS/SCRI study designs.
