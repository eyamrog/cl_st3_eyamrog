The transformation of farms and the expansion of production in
the sector of large farms in several countries forces us
to take into account a path different in which the
large farm is the one that expands production. What makes
this requirement even stronger is the fact that the expansive
presence of large-scale exploitation occurs even in countries that had
carried out reforms agrarian and even in cases of profound
transformations such as the Mexican and the Bolivian (Murmis 1980).
