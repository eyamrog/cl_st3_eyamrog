Fundamentally, the miniaturized elements of micro-linguistics might be a window,
serving as an exemplary channel to explain the notion of
mode. By micro-linguistics, this present investigator refers to phonetics/phonology, morphology,
grammar/syntax, and semantics. These micro-linguistic spheres propagate phone/phoneme, morph/morpheme, and
lexeme, as perhaps, the likely smallest entities of examining phonetics/phonology,
morphology, grammar/syntax. And one cannot but remember semes as applicable
components of semiotics.
