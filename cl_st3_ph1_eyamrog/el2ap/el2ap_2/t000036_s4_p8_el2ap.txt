In relation to the Latin American region, two clear trends
can be observed. First, a trend of approval of minimum
wages in the 1920s and 1930s. Second, there is a
tendency to differentiate minimum wages according to geographical areas, the
age of the workers, and their family or physical situation,
that is, differentiated wages for people with disabilities, and differentiated
wages for married women.
