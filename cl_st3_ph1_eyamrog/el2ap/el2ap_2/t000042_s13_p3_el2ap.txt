By April 11, 20,700 cases of COVID-19 were reported in
Brazil and the country’s death toll had mounted to 1,124.
After dramatic newspapers images of overloaded hospitals and mass graves,
Bolsonaro said he was not responsible for exacerbating the crisis
because he was “not a gravedigger.”15 He also promoted hydroxychloroquine
and chloroquine (hereafter HCQ) to combat the virus. Bolsonaro’s obsession
with these drugs was mainly political. This action underscored his
admiration of Trump; it also showed how the proverbial silver
bullet used against malaria was manipulated not to launch a
real health campaign but to mimic a palliative for political
ends. According to Bolsonaro, HCQ made social restrictions redundant and
would eventually lead to herd immunity for Brazil. Brazilian scientists
who expressed skepticism of HCQ were subject to defamatory articles
in social media platforms as well as legal inquiries from
authorities, and even received death threats.16 Bolsonaro’s glorification of HCQ
was instrumental in ensuring the support of the country’s business
establishment who were hostile to a nationwide lockdown, as well
as right-wing evangelicals (constituting about a fourth of Brazil´s population)
that wanted to carry out their religious services unimpeded by
restrictions.
