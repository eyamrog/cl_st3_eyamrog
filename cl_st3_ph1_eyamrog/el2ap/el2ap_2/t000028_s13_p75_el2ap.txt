In order to internalize the Greetings content, it is possible
to ask students to communicate with each other using the
vocabulary learned in the song. To do so, the teacher
can present a certain situation (for example, as written in
the textbook, saying hello, saying goodbye and asking people how
they are) and let students interact with one another. In
this way, such activity would not only reinforce inclusion and
interaction between the blind student and their classmates, but also
work as a playful contextualized activity, which would make students
aware of the new language as a social practice, not
only as a system of rules.
