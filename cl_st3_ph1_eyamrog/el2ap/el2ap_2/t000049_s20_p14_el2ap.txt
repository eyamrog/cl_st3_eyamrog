Observing and analyzing the children’s experiences, the researcher and supervisors
identified some elements that they deemed worthy of investigation; for
instance, for how long the children from the three groups
were manifesting scientific attitudes and the use they made of
them to investigate a specific “theme” or observed phenomenon. In
particular, groups A and B, working with and adult who
‘promotes from within’, focused on their scientific attitudes for a
longer period (from 37% during the first encounter to 42%
during the last) compared to group C (from 24% in
the first meeting to 12% in the last), where the
adult did not emphasize or favor the children’s interests and
did not willingly intervene to promote the learning process.
