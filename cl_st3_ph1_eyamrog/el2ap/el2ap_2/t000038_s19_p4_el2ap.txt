Unidimensional Congruence (UniCo = 0.918) suggested data cannot be treated
as essentially unidimensional (Ferrando e Lorenzo-Seva 2018). Nevertheless, Explained Common
Variance (ECV = 0.85) was within the limit, as values
larger than 0.85 suggests that data can be treated as
essentially unidimensional. Finally, the Mean of Item Residual Absolute Loadings
(MIREAL) value (MIREAL = 0.200), lower than 0.300 suggests that
data can be treated as essentially unidimensional. Additionally, the adjustment
indexes which assess whether the obtained factor structure is suitable
for the database show strong criteria indexes attesting to the
plausibility of this model: Root Mean Square Error of Approximation
(RMSEA = 0.067); Non-Normed Fit Index (NNFI = 0.976).
