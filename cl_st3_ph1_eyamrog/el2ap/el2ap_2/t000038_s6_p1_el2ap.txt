Our results point out a two-factor structure of the CPDI
(Qiu et al. 2020) that could be congruent if we
consider stress as the physiological or psychological response to internal
or external stressors (VandenBos 2015). The first factor, internal stressors
(items 1, 4, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
18, 19. 20, 23, and 24) is suitable for inner
manifestations [e g., palpitations, sweating, dry mouth, shortness of breath,
fidgeting, accelerated speech, augmentation of negative emotions, longer duration of
stress fatigue (VandenBos 2015)]. The second factor â€“ external stressors
(items 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 22) [e
g., any event, force, or condition that results in physical
or emotional stress (VandenBos 2015)]. Probably, it is advisable to
reformulate items (5, 6, and 21). Since the present findings
are preliminary, further replication studies for validity and reliability should
be conducted.
