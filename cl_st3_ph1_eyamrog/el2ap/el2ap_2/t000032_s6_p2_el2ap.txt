Patterns of change in Present Mood States represented by PMSL
Factors II (Fatigue), VII (Interest) and XII (Serenity) were detected
between Events (TR-PRE, MATCH and TR- POST), suggesting that the
temporal patterns of change in these mood states are repeated
along time. While the presence value of Factor VII (Interest)
increased with proximity to the match, the presence of Factor
II (Fatigue) decreased concomitantly. Torres-Luque et al. (2013) showed that
the value of the Fatigue Factor of the POMS also
decreased before the competition, then increasing after it, as expected
after physical and mental effort during a sequence of training
sessions and matches. Nogueira (2009) reported that youth soccer players
showed high values of presence in the locution “I am
tired”, which is the one with the highest load in
Factor II (Fatigue), immediately after the matches, regardless of the
outcome. Although in the present study the evaluation was performed
48 hours after the matches, as recorded in the TR-POST,
the high presence of Factor II (Fatigue) after the competition
persisted. Russell et al. (2019) highlighted an inconsistency of studies
about mental fatigue in sports, especially its influence on sports
performance and stressed the need to “improving the ecological validity
of research in the area of mental fatigue and sport”.
A possibility to do this advance, according to them, is
to investigate the effect of mental fatigue on performance over
a season.
