Although most interviewees have no doubts about the importance of
these alliances, they tend to portray them as uncertain and
subject to many disappointments. According to them, it is common
for mayors to deliver far fewer votes than promised by
the mayor and/or expected by the legislator. When this happens,
the alliance is not necessarily broken or shaken, and other
factors such as loyalty, strength of the bond, and previous
work together play an important role in the renewal of
trust.
