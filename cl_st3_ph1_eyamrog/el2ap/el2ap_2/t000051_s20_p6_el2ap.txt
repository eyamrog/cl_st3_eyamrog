There is also a discourse of personal war experience, manifest
through the mention of “Erzählungen unserer Eltern und Großeltern […]
vom Krieg” (‘our parents’ or grandparents’ tales of war’), which
invokes World War 2 experiences and constructs the narrative of
something unseen in Europe since that war, using realisations of
affect: “Entsetzen” (‘horror’), “für die Jüngeren ist es kaum fassbar:
Krieg in Europa” (‘for younger people it is almost inconceivable:
war in Europe’). Thematically, the same claim is made when
Scholz states that Putin is demolishing the European security order
that had prevailed for almost half a century since the
Helsinki Final Act. While the war in Ukraine may be
the first invasion by land, air and sea since the
World War 2, the insinuation that Europe has not experienced
war or violent redrawings of borders since then is misleading
and seems to hide NATO’s and Germany’s controversial role in
the Yugoslav wars.
