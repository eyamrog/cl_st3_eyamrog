This scoping review contributed with a systematized summary of the
available topical treatments for MFW-related pain management. Topical therapies were
identified for considerations in clinical practice, highlighting opioids, anesthetics, and
antimicrobials; however, few prospective interventional studies described effectiveness. In addition,
none explored cost- effectiveness or cost-benefits, which are relevant aspects
for clinical implementation.
