The Suruwaha Indigenous Land (SIL) is located in the municipality
of Tapauá. The SIL area comprises a total of 239,070
hectares and is located between the Riozinho River and the
Coxodoá stream, both tributaries of the Cuniuá River, which in
turn is a tributary of the Tapauá River that flows
into the Purus River [18]. The SIL is surrounded to
the west by the Deni Indigenous Land and to the
east by the Hi-Merimã Indigenous Land, of isolated indigenous peoples.
The population consists of 171 people who were living in
isolation and were contacted in the 1980s by missionaries [14].
The productive activities of the Suruwaha include agriculture, hunting, fishing,
gathering and tool making [19]. Hunting is the most prestigious
activity, and a good hunter not only kills many animals
but must also have killed many tapirs, the most coveted
game because of its size that can feed many people
[19].
