Our interviews suggest that representatives may be less reliant on
mayors to claim credit for benefits than the literature supposes.
First, as noted above, the credit claiming can be made
through a city councilor, former mayor, or another local support
(someone from their “political group”). Second, the legislators’ offices work
to give visibility to their actions. Thus, mayors would have
little room to “credit capture”. Moreover, according to the interviewees,
the growing use of social media expands the opportunities for
voters to obtain information independently and for the representative’s office
to communicate more directly with them, lowering the mayor’s importance.
