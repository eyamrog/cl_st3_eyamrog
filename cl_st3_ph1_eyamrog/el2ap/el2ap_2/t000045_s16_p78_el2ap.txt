If it is true that local brokers, especially mayors, play
an important role in the legislator’s electoral success, one would
expect that they would also be held responsible for defeats,
to some degree. Among our interviewees, two worked for representatives
who were not reelected. When questioned about the reasons for
the legislators’ defeat, although they expressed disappointment with the mayors’
performance in terms electoral brokerage, these interviewees tended to give
more importance to other factors. Among them, they emphasized the
office’s difficulty to independently communicate with voters using new technologies,
such as social media. In other words, there seems to
be an awareness of the need for representatives to become
increasingly independent of mediators to get credit for their actions.
