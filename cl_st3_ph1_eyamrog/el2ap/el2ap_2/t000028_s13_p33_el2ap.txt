The papers composing this review brought not only ideas for
didactic materials, but also provided contributions of teaching perspectives and
ways to overcome obstacles for the blind students’ development. As
Uliana (2013, p. 610) explains, “the lack of the sense
of sight is not an impassable hurdle to the mathematical
development of the student”. The same occurs in other fields,
including English language teaching, since it is possible to achieve
the teaching goals of such students with accessible materials and
inclusive methods.
