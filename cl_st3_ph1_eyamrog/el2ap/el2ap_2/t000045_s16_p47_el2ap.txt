Both survey waves show that one of their more frequent
activities is to “deal with the government agencies to meet
the requests of mayors in their region”. Among those who
listed mayors or councilors as one of their two main
supports, 71.7% of those interviewed in 2007 said they often
carried out this activity. This percentage was even higher in
2012: 73.3% of the surveyed.
