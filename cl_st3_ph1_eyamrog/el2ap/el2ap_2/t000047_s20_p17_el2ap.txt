There are two major reflectors of proxemics in this communication.
The first one happens when Social Actor 2 opens the
door to meet and contest the statement of Social Actor
1 in the toilet. Ab initio, there is a seemingly
personal distance, which the movement of Social Actor 2 collapses
to intimate distance, as he puts a lab-coat on Social
Actor 1. The second situation operates when Social Actor 1
enters, in another scene, to join Social Actor 2 to
mutually advertise Oral-B with the right hand. The proximity also
is as the first, where the movement of Social Actor
1 flops the personal distance between them, enabling an intimate
to operate to an extent that Social Actor 1 puts
his hand on the shoulder of Social Actor 2 for
a unified resolution of mutually marketing Oral-B.
