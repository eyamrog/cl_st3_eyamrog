As can be seen in table 7, the minimum wages
were divided into sectors and geographical areas, namely: manual workers
and agricultural workers; in the Sierra, on the Coast or
in the capital (Quito). Thus, the salary could fluctuate from
USD 1.17, in the case of agricultural workers in the
Sierra, to USD 4.77, in the case of manual workers
on the Coast.
