The Ecuadorian labor context is studied from three perspectives: first,
the current legal system for the decade; second, the implementation
of social security; third, the analysis of the minimum wage.
The labor system allows the construction of a clear vision
of the environment in which these activities were carried out;
on the other hand, the study of social security show
the first legal benefits that workers obtained; finally, the analysis
of the minimum wage allow to visualize how this element
was the product of an international wave towards the approval
of legal minimums for subsistence.
