The exploratory level of this research also allowed to identify
matters to consider when planning educational interventions aimed at developing
critical thinking processes. In particular, this opportunity can highlight questions
that must have answers and orient educational and didactic choices.
What strategies are more efficient in the favoring of more
complex scientific attitudes? What are the most indicated choices to
encourage the children’s verbalization and their cooperation in the investigation
of a phenomenon? How to notice and avoid the daily
routine to cause automatisms that lead to non- mirroring answers
where the adult substitutes himself to or does not welcome
the child’s inputs?
