With the main purpose of developing the taxonomic study of
Zingiberales in the Núcleo Curucutu, collections, identifications, descriptions, identification key,
illustrations and data on the geographic and phenological distribution of
the species found were carried out, thus contributing to the
knowledge of the local flora, the State of São Paulo
and the Atlantic Forest.
