These obvious vitalities of New Oral-B Toothpaste influenced the lady
to remark that the toothpaste made her mouth So fresh
at 7:00; Still fresh at 13:00, And still fresh at
19:00. If not for a reason of economy and unnecessary
repetition, the full-fledged constructs would have been [It is] so
still fresh; [it is] still fresh; And [it is] still
fresh. A bit of emphasis in these subjects is a
deliberate way of making a characteristic of Oral-B memorable. From
a semantic assessment, So, still, and still are qualifiers that
portray the manners of intensity that the advertised product has
on human teeth and mouth in terms of strength and
breath feeling. The linguistic devices also confirm the precision of
the aforementioned claims of Social Actor 1 and Social Actor
2. What they have said concerning Oral-B, in the prerogative
of Social Actor 3, the consumer, is truly accurate.
