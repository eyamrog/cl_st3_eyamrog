Municipal and general (state/national) elections in Brazil take place alternately
every two years: mayors and councilors are elected in 5,568
municipalities, and, two years later, it is the turn of
state and national legislators, senators, governors, and the president of
the Republic. While the executive heads at all levels are
elected by a majoritarian system, legislators and councilors are elected
by an open-list proportional system. In state and national elections,
except for the presidential race, the electoral districts are the
twenty-seven federation units. Even national representatives are elected in states,
and their campaigns are organized at the state level.
