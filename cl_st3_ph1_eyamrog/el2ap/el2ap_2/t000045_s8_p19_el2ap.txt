In recent years, scholars of distributive politics and clientelism have
turned their attention to brokers: people who mediate between politicians
and parties on the one hand and voters and groups
on the other. Brokers are seen as key actors to
structure and maintain clientelist networks and, therefore, mobilize voters. According
to some studies, their importance stems from their penetration in
their communities, which gives them insider knowledge about voters' preferences.
Therefore, they would be fundamental to define the best distribution
strategies (what, who, when, how much to distribute) aiming at
the highest electoral return (Stokes et al., 2013; Holland &
Palmer-Rubin, 2015; Zarazaga, 2016; Szwarcberg, 2015; Aspinall, 2014; Novaes, 2018).
