Through 2020 and 2021, the Virtual Laboratory of Affective, Cognitive,
and Behavioral Neuropsychometry – LAVINACC – conducted the Physical and
Psychological Reactions as Health Indicators throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic research.
Among other indicators, they researched the peri-traumatic stress during the
COVID-19 pandemics in Brazil using the Peri- Traumatic Distress Scale
(CPDI) (Qiu et al. 2020) to a sample of 1844
participants (Abad et al. 2020).
