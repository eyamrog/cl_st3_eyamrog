In evidence synthesis, the critical appraisal of the studies included
is essential so as to access the credibility of the
findings which is a consequence of the methodological rigor applied.
It also helps to analyze the transparency and reproducibility of
the published evidence. The absence of the critical appraisal is
a barrier to the consumers of the evidence generated since
there is hinderance in the ability to interpret the research
findings which consider the strengths and weaknesses of the study
in question (17,18).
