A system network contains delicacy which is the main principle
of ordering the system indices relating one to another. In
other words, delicacy represents a degree of detail and specificity
in a semiotic resource, signposting a scale of order from
general to specific. Delicacy, as a kind of a kind,
connotes the ordering of systems from left to right by
means of entry conditions (Dalamu, 2019b). Therefore, one might argue
that the system network is indicative of choice in any
communicative interactions because of its optional benchmark. Figure 1 validates
communicative modes as the term with entry condition of a
network system, that is, language, image, color, and music.
