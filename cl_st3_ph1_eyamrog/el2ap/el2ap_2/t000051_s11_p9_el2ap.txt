Within the category of heteroglossic expressions, on the other hand,
an utterance may be more or less dialogic, depending on
the degree to which we either make present other voices
in our utterance and reflect on them or whether we
hide them (MORSON & EMERSON, 1990, p.146). Utterances can thus
be dialogically expansive or contractive. The former type opens up
dialogic space for alternative positions and voices whereas the latter
type closes down the dialogic space by challenging, fending off
or restricting the scope of dialogic alternatives (MARTIN & WHITE,
2005, p.102â€“ 103), which we refer to as discursive struggle.
