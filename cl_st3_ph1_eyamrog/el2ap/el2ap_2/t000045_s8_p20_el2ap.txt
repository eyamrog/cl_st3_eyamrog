Brokers are primarily unelected people who play some leadership role
or has social or political capital that allows them to
influence voters. However, they can also hold public office, usually
at the local level. Their actions can extend beyond elections,
when they take on a significant role in solving community
problems (Auyero, 2001; Brierley and Nathan, 2021) and even in
government tasks at the local level (Auyero, 2000; Zarazaga, 2014;
Hoyler, Gelape, and Silotto, 2021).
