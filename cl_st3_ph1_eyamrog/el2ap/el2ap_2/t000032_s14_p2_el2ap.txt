To acess the athletes’ Present Mood States, PMSL was used.
In PMSL, mood states are accessed through 40 locutions presented
in the first singular person that denote these mood states.
A 5-point likert-type scale located at the side of each
locution contains degrees of intensity to be responded by the
participant. These 40 locutions are divided into 12 Factors, take
into account the hedonic value and activation level of each
item. In order to facilitate the description and identification of
the data, the authors who have used the PMSL in
the sporting context (Picoli, 2016; Silva, 2017) have named the
following factors from the representative locutions: I—Humiliation/Anger, II—Fatigue, III—Hope, IV—
Limerence/Empathy, V—Physiological Response, VI—Repulsion, VII—Interest, VIII— Surprise, IX—Hunger, X—Disregard/Envy, XI—Receptivity,
and XII—Serenity.
