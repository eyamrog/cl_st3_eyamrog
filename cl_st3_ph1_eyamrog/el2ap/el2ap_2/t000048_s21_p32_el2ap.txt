Maas (1977) pointed out that R. petasites is a relatively
variable species, which may present a great difference in the
size of the inflorescences according to the collection site. This
variation can be observed when comparing the specimens in the
study area with other locations. The specimens in the study
area showed scapes with 8.5-37.4 cm long and inflorescences of
3-7.2 cm long, which are small structures compared to specimens
from other locations, reaching 50 cm long of scape and
30 cm long of inflorescence (according to: H. Mos√©n 2966,
Reitz & Klein 4027 and L.A Mattos Silva 3673).
