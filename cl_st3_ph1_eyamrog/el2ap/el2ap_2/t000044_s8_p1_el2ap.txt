When people speak, they naturally gesticulate and gestures often reveal
information that cannot easily be found in the speech. Students
are no exception. A student's gestures can index moments of
conceptual instability and teachers can use them to gain access
to a student's thinking. Students can also discover new ideas
from the gestures they produce during a class or the
gestures they see their teachers produce. Gesture, therefore, has the
power not only to reflect a student's understanding of a
problem but also to change their understanding (NOVACK; GOLDIN- MEADOW,
2015).
