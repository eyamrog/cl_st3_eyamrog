The communicator illuminates the evidence of every morning and long
lasting fresh breath with substantiation from Social Actor 3. In
this case, the woman cleans her teeth in the morning,
precisely at 7:00, and the fresh breath feeling lasts till
13:00, while in the office, and still sustains till 19:00
in the evening, while returning home. That experience of Oral-Bâ€™s
2-IN-1 influences Social Actor 3 to emphatically comment thus: So
fresh; Still fresh; and And still fresh. As the settings
of the ad are Oral-B Dental Institute, toilet, offices, and
home, the participants enhance their communication activities with head movement
in sagittal, rotational, and lateral ways up to about 90o
- to facilitate gaze - , personal and intimate distances,
gestural touching of the teeth, and demonstration of fresh breath
feeling. The Oral- B communication is metaphorically critical, especially, the
illustration of 2-IN-1 as touching the indexical Social Actors 1
and 2, and the dual qualities of the 2-IN-1 benefit
of Oral-B. This construction is good for academic purposes. However,
there is a need to simplify this as so that
the illiterate might quickly understand its meaning potentials.
