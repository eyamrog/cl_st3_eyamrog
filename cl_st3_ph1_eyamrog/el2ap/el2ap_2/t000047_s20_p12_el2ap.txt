The ad propagates the evidence of the 2-IN-1 superiority of
Oral-B in HLMA 3. Here the LLMA begins in O-BT24
and ends with O-BT27. In these accounts, time has become
imperative, as shown on top of the frames as 7:00,
7:43, 13:00, and 19:00. The narratives illustrate a historical account
of a tested and trusted product. The various time factors
imply that the lady (labeled as Social Actor 3) cleansed
her teeth with Oral-B at 7:00 in the morning, and
left her home for the office around 7:43 with a
fresh breath. This was in obedience to the first statement
of You clean your teeth every morning. While in the
office as at 13:00, the fresh breath remained in her
mouth. Surprisingly, as at 19:00 later in the evening while
returning home from the office Oral-B still sustained the propagated
fresh breath.
