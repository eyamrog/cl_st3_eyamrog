Based on this perspective, Bracht (2013) analyzes that PE is
considered an arm of the medical institution, acting by means
of physical exercises. For Rigo, Pardo and Silveira (2007) this
understanding eventually divided society and schools among healthy and sick
individuals, more and less skilled, potentiating the exclusion of students.
This perspective of PE suffered alterations and changes due to
the expansion of knowledge of human and social sciences, especially
those that address health, because its restricted conception proved to
lack complementation, considering the factors that affected it (PAIVA et
al., 2017).
