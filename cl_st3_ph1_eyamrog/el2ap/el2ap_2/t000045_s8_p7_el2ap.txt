While we do not question the importance of local political
actors as brokers for legislators, our findings reveal the limits
of principal-agent theories — the theoretical framework most commonly used
to study this topic (Stokes et al., 2013) — to
describe these relationships in Brazil, especially when brokers hold elective
office and play a dual role. We find no support
for the assumptions that there is an inherent conflict of
objectives between brokers and bosses, or an informational asymmetry in
favor of the former regardless of the context.
