Efforts to monitor the behavior of local brokers include some
systematic procedures such as spreadsheets with information about them, number
of votes delivered, and expectations for the next election. Except
for one, all legislators’ offices kept some version of this
spreadsheet. This kind of practice aligns with the idea that
politicians draw on election cycles to learn about brokers’ abilities
(Gingerich, 2020). Nevertheless, our interviews also revealed more informal ways
of monitoring. They are all based on gathering information concerning
broker’s efforts, what she has done or is doing, but
keeping in mind what it is in her power to
accomplish.
