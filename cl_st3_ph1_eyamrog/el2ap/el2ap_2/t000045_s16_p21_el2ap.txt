We noticed a perception that demands from councilors are more
diversified than mayoral ones, which, for the most part, ask
for financial resources. Mayors tend to be associated with requests
of a more general nature (although it is not uncommon
for them to seek help in favor of groups and
individuals). In contrast, councilors tend to act predominantly on behalf
of individuals and social organizations (which they call “entidades”).
