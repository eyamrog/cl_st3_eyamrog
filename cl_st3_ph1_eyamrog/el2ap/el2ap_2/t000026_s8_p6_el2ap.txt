Given this worrying scenario, anxious symptoms may contribute to the
inappropriate use of prescription anxiolytic drugs among university health students
(PÃ©rez et al., 2023). This population is a target for
the misuse of these psychotropic drugs, as they have a
certain degree of economic independence, are free from direct supervision
by parents or guardians, and are more likely to try
them to help cope with the overload of curricular activities
(Nogueira et al., 2021; Souza et al., 2022).
