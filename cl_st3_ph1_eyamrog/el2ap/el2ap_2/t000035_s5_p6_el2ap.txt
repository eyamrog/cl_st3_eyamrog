However, treatment by means of complete dentures is not always
successful, and dissatisfaction can occur in around 10 to 20%
of cases30. Silva et al.33 argue that dissatisfaction can affect
more individuals, even leading some users to abandon their dentures,
as occurred with one of the participants of the task
force. The authors observed this behavior after an interview-based evaluation
in a group of twelve patients treated with complete dentures,
where three declared themselves totally satisfied and nine were classified
as dissatisfied. Of these patients, six considered their dentures to
be good, but indicated difficulties in using them, especially the
lower dentures, while three were totally dissatisfied and unable to
use the dentures, due to pain and appearance. A small
portion of patients will never adapt to mucous supported dentures,
either due to psychological reasons, the age of the patient,
previous experiences with dentures or because they do not meet
their expectations34. This conclusion was corroborated by the fact that
two patients did not use the dentures in the final
interview, while one patient attributed a score of zero for
chewing, stability, and comfort of the lower dentures. There is
also a tendency to experience more difficulty in adapting to
the use of lower dentures than upper dentures34.
