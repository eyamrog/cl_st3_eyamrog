One observes the establishment of 2-IN-1 excellence of Oral-B in
HLMA 2, as configured within O-BT19 to O-BT23. The domain
begins with the appearances of seemingly two cartons of Oral-B,
the advertised product, from left and right with the assistance
of two hands. The horizontal movements of the cartons from
two dissimilar ends initiate the fusing possibility of the two
cartons into a single entity. The statements: With Oral-B 2-in-1
toothpaste, it helps your teeth; And gives your mouth long
lasting fresh breath, which are declarative clauses simultaneously backing the
fusing images of the toothpaste into one indivisible body. Because
Oral-B is the goal of the ad, the meaner uses
O-BT21 as a shade of emphasis. That is the motive
for demonstrating modes such as 2-IN-1; NEW and the carton
of Oral-B as held with a social actor’s right hand
for viewers’ sensitivity.
