Additionally, another limitation of the study is the composition of
the sample, which was mainly composed of women. To overcome
this limitation in future studies, one could try to balance
the proportion of men and women in the sample, using
stratified or quota sampling techniques. The generalization of the results
should be done with caution, as convenience sampling resulted in
a higher concentration of participants from the state of Sergipe,
which does not guarantee the representativeness of the results for
the entire Brazilian population. Therefore, new research should replicate this
study, considering the limitations pointed out.
