Ten (14.2%) studies proposed using topical antimicrobials such as Metronidazole,
Nanocrystalline Silver, and Silver Sulfadiazine to manage MFW-related pain. These
studies were case studies (40%), randomized clinical trials (20%), non-systematic
reviews (10%), retrospective cohorts (10%), systematic reviews (10%), and surveys
(10%). Six (60%) reported using antimicrobials, although pain was not
their main focus, but did not present the form of
use or the outcomes.
