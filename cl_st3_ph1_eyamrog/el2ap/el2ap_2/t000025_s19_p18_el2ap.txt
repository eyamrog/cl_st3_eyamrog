This scoping review categorized antimicrobial substances as topical antimicrobials, honey,
and antiseptics. We consider any implications of antimicrobial substances if
they present the ability to kill or inhibit the growth
and development of a microorganism (bacteria, fungi, and viruses), including
antibiotics, antiseptics, and disinfectants.
