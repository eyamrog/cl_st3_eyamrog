Another way to deal with an imbalance between the volume
of requests and available resources is to consider other sources
of aid to the municipality. Representatives consider, for example, the
fact that some organizations, such as Apaes and Santa Casas,
receive resources from several representatives. They can also refer the
mayor (or other local leaders) to other legislators, concentrating their
resources where their prospects for electoral returns are greater and
less uncertain.
