Meanwhile, João Doria, governor of the relatively affluent state of
São Paulo—a businessman with aspirations to candidacy in the October
2022 presidential election in which Bolsonaro will seek a second
term—promoted masks, established restrictions and demanded coordination with federal authorities.
Doria was harshly criticized by Bolsonaro. At the same time,
official anti-communist and xenophobic campaigns were launched, thereby fueling hate-
crimes against Asian Brazilians (Brazil has the highest number of
migrants from Japan and China in Latin America). China was
accused of intentionally spreading the pandemic, even though research demonstrated
that the majority of COVID-19 cases among Brazilians had originated
in Italy.14
