However, the theories of brokers based on principal-agent models do
not seem entirely suitable to describe brokerage relationships in which
both parties hold an elected office and look for votes.
The rigid assumptions they adopt – notably the existence conflicting
goals between principal and agent (Gailmard, 2012) and informational asymmetry
in favor of the latter – are not always valid
for describing the relationship between Brazilian legislators and their local
brokers. As we seek to show in the following sections,
these relationships can take different forms, and there is no
single possible equilibrium.
