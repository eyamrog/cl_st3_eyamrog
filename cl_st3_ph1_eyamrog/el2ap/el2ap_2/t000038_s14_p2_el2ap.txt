We implemented EFA using a Polychoric Matrix and Robust Diagonally
Weighted Least Squares (RDWLS) extraction method. RDWLS is advised when
the univariate distributions of ordinal items are asymmetric) (Asparouhov e
Muth√©n 2010). We used the Parallel Analysis with random permutation
as an improved method to asses dimensionality. We based the
decision of dimensionality on the percentage of common explained variance
(Timmerman e Lorenzo-Seva 2011). As a rotation technique, we used
the Robust Promin (Ferrando e Lorenzo-Seva 2018).
