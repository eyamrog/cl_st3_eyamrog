Regarding budget amendments, legislators’ offices usually organize spreadsheets containing all
the requests, detailed by object (public work, equipment, vehicle purchase,
and the like.), amount, municipality, and the broker who mediated
and presented the request. Before legislators officially assign an amendment
to a locality, the office usually contacts the requesters to
inform them what can be done. Since it is impossible
to fulfill all requests most of the time, mayors and
councilors have to decide what they want to prioritize. For
most interviewees, especially those who define the legislator as a
“municipalist”, there is no doubt that the budget amendments are
the resources most valued by mayors.
