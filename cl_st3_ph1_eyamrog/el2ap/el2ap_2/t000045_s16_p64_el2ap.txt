The analysis of these brokerage relationships seems to offer little
support for another important premise of principal-agent models: informational asymmetry
in favor of the agent. Several studies on brokers assume
that brokers have insider information relative to bosses and strategically
use this advantage to extract more resources (Stokes et al.,
2013; Camp, Dixit and Stokes, 2014; Keefer and Vlaicu, 2007;
Novaes, 2018).
