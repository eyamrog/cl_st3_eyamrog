Presence values of Factors IV (Limerence/Empathy) and VII (Interest) differed
in their patterns of change according to a Series of
Events, as shown by the mean presence values of PMSL
Factors related to the same match. The mean presence values
of Factors IV (Limerence/Empathy) and VII (Interest) decreased as soon
as the chances of classification for the next championship phase
became improbable (between Series 1 and 2 Matches), with the
team already eliminated from the competition after the second match
and participating in the remaining matches only for a perfunctory
appearance. The relationship between these Factors within this context can
be understood in terms of the interaction between group cohesion
(Lafferty et al., 2017) and achievement goals (Mascret et al.,
2015). The elimination may have affected group cohesion, explaining the
reduced value of Factor IV (Limerence/Empathy). Thus, these data suggest
that, regardless of this unfavorable context, the mood states related
to these PMSL Factors are commonly observed in competitive collective
sport experience.
