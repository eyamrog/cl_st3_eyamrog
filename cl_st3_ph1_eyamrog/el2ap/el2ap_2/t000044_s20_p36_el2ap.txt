According to Goldin-Meadow (2018), gesture has the potential to boost
learning in all children and perhaps reduce inequalities in performance
in language and mathematics. Also, it can be a tool
that helps teachers understand what is going on in the
students' minds, as well as understand how much they learned
from the content through their speeches articulated with their gestures.
