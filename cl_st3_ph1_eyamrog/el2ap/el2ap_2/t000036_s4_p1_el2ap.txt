The decade of 1930 involved a two-period process: first, the
one that receives the impact of the Great Depression; second,
the one that presents a slow recovery. The first is
characterized by the implementation of monetary instruments such as the
gold standard and the centralization of monetary emission through the
Central Bank of Ecuador.
