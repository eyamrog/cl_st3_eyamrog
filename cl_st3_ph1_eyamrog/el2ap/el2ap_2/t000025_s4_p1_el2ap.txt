This scoping review of the available literature about topical therapies
for topical MFW- related pain management included 70 studies with
20 topical therapies categorized as dressings (non-adherent dressing, hydrogel, absorbent
dressing, and anti-inflammatory dressing); analgesic drugs (topical opioids, topical anesthetics,
medical cannabis); antimicrobial substances (antimicrobials, honey, and antiseptics); cryotherapy; and
negative pressure wound therapy. For periwound skin interventions: zinc oxide
(ointment and cream), silicone (adhesive remover), dimethicone, petrolatum, acrylate, cyanoacrylate,
hydrocolloid (plate and powder), and a vitamin- rich ointment (A
and D) were identified. Some technical aspects related to MFW
pain management included irrigating with a warm solution, careful application
and the removal of the dressing, no debridement, maintaining a
moist environment in the wound bed, cleaning with soap with
an appropriate pH, reducing the frequency of dressing changes, and
applying systemic analgesia before the dressing. However, there is a
lack of studies describing the products' mode of use in
detail and their effectiveness for evidence-based informed practice.
