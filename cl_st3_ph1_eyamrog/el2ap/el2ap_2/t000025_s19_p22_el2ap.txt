Only three (4%) studies proposed topical antiseptics such as Polyhexamethylene
Biguanide, Octenidine, and other non-specified degerming agents for MFW pain
management. The studies included randomized clinical trials (66.6%) and non-systematic
reviews (33.4%). None of the studies had pain control as
the primary aim but the control of general symptoms, including
pain. The three studies analyzed 54 patients, predominantly women, between
24 and 92 years old, with primary tumors, mainly of
the breast. Pain was assessed using verbal classification and visual
analog scales in two of the studies. The use of
topical antiseptics resulted in pain improvement in two studies and
no changes in pain intensity scores in one study (Table
9).
