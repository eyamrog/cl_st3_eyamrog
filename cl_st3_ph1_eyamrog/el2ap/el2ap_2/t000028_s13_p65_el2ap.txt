Besides group exercises, the EAL teacher can also work with
tactile resources to design inclusive didactic activities. As Uliana (2013)
demonstrates through the production of a pedagogical kit, such concrete
materials are very important in the learning process of blind
students, since through them those students are able to learn
at the same level as sighted students. Numbers (Image 6)
are also an interesting topic to be explored.
