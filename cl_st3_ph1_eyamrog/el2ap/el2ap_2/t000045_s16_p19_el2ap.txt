It was surprising to note the importance attributed to city
councilors both in the interviews and on the survey, given
the little attention the literature gives to relations city councilors
with actors outside the local arena. In our interviews, advisors
emphasized the importance of councilors, especially in municipalities where a
legislator “does not have the mayor”, and councilors can work
towards winning (or recovering) the local Executive.
