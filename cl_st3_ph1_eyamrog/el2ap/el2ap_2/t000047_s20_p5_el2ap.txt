Social Actor 1 gives a support to the issue of
breath feeling, raised by Social Actor 2, using the toothbrush
in his hand as a gestural accent to that. Social
Actor 1 rotates his head to facilitate gaze and queries
that: The answer? The answer in this context is an
interrogative clause, which elements are punctuated (Cook, 2001). The individual
would have said: [What is] the answer? The fragmentation is
to fulfill a principle of aptness and textual economy in
advertising (Leech, 1966; Gieszinger, 2001). Social Actor 2 responds with
a communicative component, Easy. Easy would have come in the
form of an imperative clause, [Take it] easy. However, for
the principles highlighted earlier, the component, Easy, in 1d serves
as an invaluable proportion of advertising. There is a need
to calm Social Actor 1 down because of the confidence
that Social Actor 2 has in Oral-B though Social Actor
1 is still kept in suspense.
