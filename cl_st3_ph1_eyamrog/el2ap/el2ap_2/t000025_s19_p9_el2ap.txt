Eleven out of the 70 studies (15.7%) recommended using hydrogels
to manage MFW- related pain. The studies included non-systematic reviews
(54.5%), case studies (36.3%), and systematic reviews (9.2%). Eight (72.7%)
studies discussed hydrogel perfunctorily as an optional dressing for these
patients to reduce pain by maintaining a moist wound environment.
Discussions were brief without substantiation. The hydrogel was also mentioned
as a vehicle to deliver other active substances such as
opioids, anesthetics, and antibiotics in the included studies. None of
the studies presented a standardized way of using this type
of dressing, and no results were presented.
