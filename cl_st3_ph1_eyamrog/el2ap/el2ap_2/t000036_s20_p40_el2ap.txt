The legal changes around the implementation of minimum wages came
along with some populism governments which encountered the economic crisis
of 1929 as the opportunity to claim the guilt on
the northern hegemon. As many governments of that period sought
the electoral support of the popular masses, the political leaders
offered to establish benefits for the workers and employees such
as Lázaro Cárdenas in Mexico (1934-1940), Getulio Vargas in Brazil
(1930-1943), Juan Domingo Perón in Argentina (1943-1955) (Zapata 2002). In
the case of Ecuador, the changes where produced within the
context of the Julian Revolution (1925-1932), and the entrance of
the first populist government of Velasco Ibarra (1934-1935).
