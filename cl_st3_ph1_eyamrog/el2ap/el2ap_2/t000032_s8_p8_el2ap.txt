The investigation of the Present Mood States and its changes
over time is relevant in order to help construct the
periodization of training and competition and also in order to
permit psychological intervention aiming at a better preparation of the
athlete for competition. Although, mood states seem to be stable
during a competitive period, as suggested by the conclusions of
Vega Marcos et al. (2008) and Box et al. (2018),
the presence of different stimuli and contexts (such as phase
of competition, field position, location, environment, social contacts and match
outcomes), may modify the intensity and valence of these states
as shown by Bueno and Di Bonifácio (2009), Nogueira (2009),
Torres- Luque et al. (2013) and Hagan et al. (2017b).
The aim of the present study was to examine wheter
Present Mood States of youth soccer players’ changes or not
during a competitive period (sequence of matches and trainning sessions)
as a function of the closeness of the match.
