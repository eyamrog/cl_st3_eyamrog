Cryotherapy promotes cold-induced vasoconstriction and causes muscle spasms that slow
down nerve conduction, reducing pain (Farah et al., 2021). However,
no primary studies have been found evaluating the effectiveness of
cryotherapy in the past five years. Therefore, it is not
included in the guideline for patients with MFWs published by
the European Oncology Nursing Society (EONS, 2015). The lack of
primary studies in cryotherapy may be the result of the
development of new therapies and coverage for pain in MFW
which demonstrate greater effectiveness and ease of application.
