The modernization of Ecuadorian institutions came hand in hand with
the visit of the Kemmerer Mission, which advised the government
on the creation of the Central Bank of Ecuador, which
centralized the monetary issue and, together with this institution, several
control organisms were created such as the Comptroller General of
the State and the Superintendency of Banks. In addition, the
gold standard was implemented as the main monetary policy. A
good part of the countries of the Latin American region
went through similar processes, that is, the creation of national
banks, of control institutions, and the restoration of the gold
standard.
