In 2017, at the University of Pennsylvania, researchers Matsumoto and
Dobs conducted a study in which they investigated the functions
of gesture in teaching and learning grammar in the context
of classroom interactions in a second language, as did Huang,
Kin, and Christianson (2019), but now in higher education. The
research consisted of the analysis of the gestures used by
the teachers to explain temporal concepts of the English language
and the students when they answered. The analysis reached the
considerations that teachers and students repeatedly used abstract and metaphorical
lithic gestures in the classroom, which can become important resources
for instruction and assessment of student learning.
