At the same time as we are involved in researching
social issues in which language is a constitutive element, we
seek not only to discuss, but also to promote interventions
for the problems studied (SCHLATTER, 2009), which configures an Applied
Linguistics approach. According to Mason (2002), “qualitative research should be
conducted as a moral practice, and with regard to its
political context” (p. 8). In the present work, we are
foraging solutions for the lack of adapted EAL materials for
blind students attending the 6th grade. For this reason, this
research can also be described as propositional, since we offer
an adaptation for EAL activities that do not address to
blind students’ learning needs.
