An association was also observed between the type of university
and the use of anxiolytic drugs. Female students had a
higher occurrence of use of these drugs, a result in
line with the findings of other national studies (Aquino et
al., 2010; BojaniÄ‡ et al., 2021; Souza et al., 2022).
This result can be partially explained by the greater exposure
of women to medicalization at all stages of their life,
greater demand for medical care, and educational campaigns more directed
at them (Forster et al., 2019). On the other hand,
the lower percentage of male participants may be attributed to
the tendency of men to be less likely to seek
help to deal with their mental health problems (Souza et
al., 2022).
