Globally, the 90â€™s decade witnessed significant landmarks in favor of
people with impairments. The World Declaration on Education for All
asserted that every single person has the right to education
and must have access to basic conditions of learning (UNESCO,
1990). In 1994, the Salamanca Statement was announced by the
United Nations to ensure social and educational inclusion, stating that
people with special needs must receive equal education, regardless of
any limitation (FIGUEIREDO; KATO, 2015).
