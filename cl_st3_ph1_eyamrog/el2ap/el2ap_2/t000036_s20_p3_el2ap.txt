The data on the economic active population in Ecuador during
the 1930s are somewhat obscure because there are no exact
references to processes and organized by the central government in
the form of national censuses. Thus, the data presented are
approximations based on local projections. The National Economic Planning and
Coordination Board calculated that by 1962 32% of the population
could be considered economically active.
