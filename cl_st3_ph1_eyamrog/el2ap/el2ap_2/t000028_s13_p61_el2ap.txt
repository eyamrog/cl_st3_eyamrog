It is important to encourage cooperation and interaction between sighted
and non-sighted students, which could be achieved with group activities
(CAMARGO; NARDI, 2006; BIAGINI; GONÃ‡ALVES, 2017;). For instance, activity A
(in Image 4), which concerns Occupations vocabulary, could be adapted
to a group interactional activity, focused on the speaking and
listening skills.
