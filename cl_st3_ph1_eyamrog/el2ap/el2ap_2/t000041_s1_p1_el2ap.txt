(Floristic survey of a Caatinga area of high biological importance
in the Mesoregion of Paraíba backlands, Northeast Brazil). The Caatinga
occupies an area of approximately 912,529 km², being one of
the most distinct phytogeographic regions of the Brazilian territory. It
has a vegetation that varies according to its distribution and
relationship with the geography of each area. This study aimed
to carry out a floristic survey of ABA farm, located
in the municipality of Passagem, mesoregion of the Paraíba backlands.
For four years, fortnightly botanical collections were carried out in
all the plant's physiognomies on the farm, following a standard
botanical protocol of floristic survey and herborization techniques. The results
of this research brought up an important floristic list, consisting
of 322 species from 194 genera belonging to 62 botanical
families. Among these families, the ones with the higher number
of species were Fabaceae (48 spp.), Euphorbiaceae (23 spp.), Convolvulaceae
(21 spp.), Malvaceae (19 spp.) and Asteraceae (15 spp.). The
habits were herbs (108 spp.), trees (59 spp.), subshrubs (56
spp.), shrubs (46 spp.), lianas (46 spp.), epyphytes and parasites
(four spp.) In addition, 38 new species records were registered
for the Paraíba State.
