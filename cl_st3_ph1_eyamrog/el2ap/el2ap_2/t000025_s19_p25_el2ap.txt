Topical therapies applied to periwound skin Eleven (15.7%) studies discussed
therapies for pain management in the periwound skin area. The
studies were non-systematic reviews (63.7%), case studies (18.1%), guidelines (9.1%),
and surveys (9.1%). The proposed therapies were zinc oxide (ointment
and cream), silicone, dimethicone, petrolatum, acrylate and cyanoacrylate, hydrocolloid (paste
and powder), and vitamin-rich ointment (A and D), all of
which are part of pain-control protocols. All studies were coordinated
by nurses and published in journals on wounds, palliative care,
oncology, and general nursing. Two studies reported assessing pain, and
one mentioned a Visual Analog Scale as the instrument used
to measure pain. Positive results are reported, however, not further
described (Table 11).
