The discussions of modes interconnect subjects such as the investigation
of aesthetics in digital configurations (Adami, 2014), pictorial images in
online newspapers operational as language (Knox, 2016), and contextualization of
filmic discourse within the concept of GeM (Bateman, 2013). There
are also the placement of multi-literacy within the domain of
multimodality (Eisanmann & Meyer, 2018), cognitive semiotic of gesture (Iriskhanova
& Cienki, 2018), and gestural modes being the companion of
political comments of persuasion (Kra≈õnicka, 2020). In a significant standard,
Martin and Zappavigna (2018) and Unsworth (2020) highlight to explicate
embodied meaning of paralanguage, regarding Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) acuity
and intermodal association in school science genre. Hiippala and Bateman
(2020), Bezerra (2020), and Dalamu (2021) problematize communicative issues to
explain diagrammatic mode and multimodal constructs of cinematic picture of
female actresses in a specific film and semiotic genre.
