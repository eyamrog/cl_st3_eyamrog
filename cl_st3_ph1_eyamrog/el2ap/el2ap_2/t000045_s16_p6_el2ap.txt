The interviews revealed that mayors (prefeitos), local councilors (vereadores), former
mayors, and former councilors, i.e., people holding or having held
office, are the most valuable brokers for state legislators. The
survey corroborates this result. When asked about relevant support for
their electoral victory, the region’s mayors are the second most
important category in both waves of the state legislators survey.
If we add up the first and second most relevant
support, at least 30% of the interviewees in both waves
of the survey said that the support of “mayors from
their region” was one of the top two most important
ones (36.5% in 2007 and 30.3% in 2012). This result
converges with other studies that highlight the importance of mayors
as local brokers (Mares and Young, 2016, Gingerich, 2020).
