“Health I think is related to happiness, to well-being, so
as long as you feel good in your body. You
do not have an ideal situation ever, especially teenagers, whose
bodies are in formation, sometimes is overweight, sometimes the boy
is very skinny, there was a boy, I don’t even
remember his name, who talked about anabolic steroids, that he
wanted to see if it worked. They seek, they have
all media access and they seek a perfect thing. Health
is the balance of each one” (Larissa – Sciences teacher).
