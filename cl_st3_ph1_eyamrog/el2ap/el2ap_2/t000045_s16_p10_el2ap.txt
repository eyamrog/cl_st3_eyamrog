An interesting element from the interviews and often overlooked by
the literature is that “support from the municipality” is often
not synonymous with “support from the mayor”. Advisors refer to
these supports as “representatives’ municipalities” (municípios do deputado) or “our
municipalities” (nossos municípios). Nevertheless, what defines whether or not a
municipality is “the legislator’s” is an aligned mayor or the
support of a political leader, most often city councilors, former
mayors, former councilors, people who have run or intend to
run in the future. In other words, a legislator may
include a municipality in her sphere of influence without necessarily
having the mayor’s support.
