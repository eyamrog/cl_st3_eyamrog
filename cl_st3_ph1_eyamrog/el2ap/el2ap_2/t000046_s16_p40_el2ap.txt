“How can I answer you? I’m not prepared to answer,
so it’s difficult, everything I say will be obvious, and
about PE, we cannot think only of an undergraduate course,
we have to think that PE is also part of
the health area... Even in our planning, a teacher, who
is not in the area, who teaches philosophy, made a
statement that I found interesting, to have in school what
there were many years ago, which is the fact that
students, children take vaccines inside the school and not parents
take the children to take the vaccines in the appropriate
places, because often parents do not take them, why don’t
health, health departments come in here and do this work?
Just as the dental department of the city came here
to do a job, did brushing, teaches children to brush,
they brush with fluoride, many things. I think health would
also be feasible” (Clara – Manager).
