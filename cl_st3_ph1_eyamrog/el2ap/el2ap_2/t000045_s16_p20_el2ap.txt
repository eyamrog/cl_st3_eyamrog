The legislator is very hierarchical; she has always thought that
the councilor has to take her demands to the mayor,
and the mayor has to bring them here. (…) But
it doesn't mean, right, (...), that we don't assist the
councilor. We do it a lot when the mayor is
not ours. When the mayor is ours, it’s unjustifiable to
receive her here because it’s like she’s going over the
head of the executive branch there (Chief of Staff 4).
