Scholz introduces his speech by claiming that the Russian invasion
of Ukraine marks a “Zeitenwende” in the history of Europe,
officially translated as ‘watershed’. I will here refer to this
as the watershed discourse. It is at the level of
the proximal not- yet-spoken, as it is the Scholz government’s
way to justify a range of potentially controversial policies, by
the logic that a new era needs to be reacted
to in new ways. The discourse is manifestly tied to
the actions of Russia through Scholz’s analysis of the alleged
turning point (example 1), which is introduced by the contractive
proclaim “im Kern geht es um” to show that Scholz
knows what this is fundamentally about.
