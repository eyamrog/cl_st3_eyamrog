In this first version of the tool, quality scores are
recommended but no weighting scores have been attributed to the
individual items in the domains evaluated. This allows flexibility of
the evaluation process depending on the type of evidence synthesis
being elaborated. Quality scores have previously been criticized as being
poor predictors of the overall quality of a study especially
when they are considered as a factor for the performance
of a meta-analysis (26,27).
