Since the textbook is the first of the “Way to
English” collection, it approaches basic aspects of the English language,
presenting activities in English and in Portuguese, according to their
level of difficulty - that is, the less complex activities
are written in English and the more complex ones in
Portuguese. The book starts with a brief presentation about how
important and ordinary the English language is in our daily
lives, as well as a description of the purpose of
the four volumes of the collection. Following the presentation, there
is a summary of the eight units of the textbook,
in terms of sections and contents. The following section, entitled
“Tips into Practice”, presents activities of reading and learning strategies,
which intend to build students’ confidence to complete the exercises
throughout the textbook. Then, there are two pages regarding sentences,
in English, to be used in class by students and
teachers.
