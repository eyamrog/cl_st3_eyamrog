Factor V (Physiologic) was the one showing the greatest change
during the study since the differences detected showed a pattern
of Factor presence over the time course of the sequence
of Series of Events, side by side with specific changes
in Series 3. The TR-POST presence values were higher than
MATCH and TR-PRE values for all 3 Series. In Series
3, some changes were detected in the presence values of
this Factor compared to Series 1 and 2. TR-PRE presence
values were higher in Series 1 (p=0.007) and 2 (p=0.000)
than those of the MATCHES of both series, but the
TR-PRE value of Series 3 was lower than that of
MATCH 3 (p=0,000). The MATCH presence values differed between the
3 Series, with the Series 2 MATCH value being lower
than those of Series 1 and 3. Thus, analysis of
the interaction between Series and Event revealed a common pattern
for the presence of mood states Factors along the temporal
sequence for all 3 Series, although there were some significant
and specific changes in Series 3 compared to Series 1
and 2.
