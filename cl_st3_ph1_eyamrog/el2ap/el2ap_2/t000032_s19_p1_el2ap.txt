The data reported refer to the comparisons of the mean
values of all participants as a single group, since there
were not statistically differences between values of the presence of
PMSL factors as a function of playerâ€™s field position. Factors
I (Humiliation/Anger), VI (Repulsion), VIII (Surprise), IX (Hunger) and X
(Disregard/Envy) showed very low presence values (> 0.30) throughout the
study.
