Attitude is divided into affect (the emotive dimension of meaning;
reactions to behaviour), judgement (the ethical/moral dimension of meaning; evaluation
of behaviour according to some norm) and appreciation (the aesthetic
dimension of meaning; evaluating a text, a process or a
phenomenon) (MARTIN & WHITE, 2005, p.42–44). We can think of
these expressions of attitude as “institutionalised feelings, which take us
out of our everyday common sense world into the uncommon
sense worlds of shared community values” (MARTIN & WHITE, 2005,
p.45). Thus, judgement implicitly or explicitly invokes some rule or
regulation and “reworks feelings in the realm of proposals about
behaviour” whereas appreciation expresses evaluation of “semiotic and natural phenomena”
and “reworks feelings as propositions about the value of things”
(MARTIN & WHITE, 2005, p.45). Appreciation and judgement are not
separate, but overlapping, with affect expressing a more personal evaluation
within both of them (see the illustration in MARTIN &
WHITE, 2005, p.45).
