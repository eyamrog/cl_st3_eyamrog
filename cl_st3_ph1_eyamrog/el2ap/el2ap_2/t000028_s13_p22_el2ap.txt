It is important to notice that, even though there was
a resource room 10 for special educational services, there were
no pedagogic materials available for blind students to access all
the curricular content, leaving many gaps in their learning process.
Consequently, the teacher was required to design an improvised material,
often without financial assistance, to supply the demand for adapted
material unavailable at school.
