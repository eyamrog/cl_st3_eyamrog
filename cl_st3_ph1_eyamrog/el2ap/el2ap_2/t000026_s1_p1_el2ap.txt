This article aimed to analyze the correlation between anxiety and
the use of anxiolytics among university students in the health
area. A nationwide online survey was conducted with 286 university
students in the health area, 77.9% of whom were female,
with a mean age of 23.3 years (standard deviation =
4.9). Among the main results, it is noteworthy that 39.86%
of the students used anxiolytic medication, most of whom were
veterans (87.9%). The use of anxiolytic drugs was detected in
58.8% of students with high trait anxiety and in 60.5%
of those with moderate state anxiety. In addition to the
statistically significant association between medication use and university type, there
was a significant correlation between age and trait anxiety -
weak negative. Universities should encourage strategies for managing anxiety and
include actions to reduce its symptoms in their support programs.
