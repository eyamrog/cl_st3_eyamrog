It is also important to remember not to impose all
the responsibility exclusively on in-service teachers, who mostly are overcharged
and are not given the working conditions and necessary time
to adapt materials. In the case of many public schools,
the deficiency of tactile resources available to be used as
didactic materials in many disciplines also represents a problem (ULIANA,
2013). Such matter was one of the motivations to Ulianaâ€™s
research (2013), which aimed to construct and experiment a pedagogical
kit to teach Math for blind students. In semi-structured interviews,
both teachers and students highlighted the necessity of having adapted
materials specifically designed for blind students available at school, among
other factors reported in Chart 2.
