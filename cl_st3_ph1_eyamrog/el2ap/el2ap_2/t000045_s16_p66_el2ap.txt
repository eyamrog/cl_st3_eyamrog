On the other hand, as our analysis has shown, legislators
are also important informational actors for local brokers. A significant
part of what their offices offer for allies is information
that depends on their expertise and differentiated access to state
executive agencies, something not available for many municipalities’ leaders. Therefore,
there is mutual dependence on information valued by each agent
in this transaction. This interpretation converges with the findings of
one of the most extensive studies on brokers ever conducted.
Brierley and Nathan (2021), studying the selection of brokers in
Ghana, found no evidence supporting the “information asymmetry model” (2021:1).
According to the authors, rather than downward ties to ordinary
voters or detailed information about them, what mattered in selecting
brokers was their upward ties and personal connections with members
of party elites. Brokers with better upward ties are brokers
with more knowledge and access to government agencies that concentrate
the resources voters need.
