The purchasing power of the economically active population also varied
according to the labor group. From the first group, there
is no more information because the population was involved in
the exchange and commercialization system under the barter system. Due
to the absence of primary data and the complexity of
making calculations based on commercial exchange and not on the
monetary value of a job, it is impossible to calculate
exact amounts.
