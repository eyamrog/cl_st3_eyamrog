Some mayors attribute “the [eventual] switch of sides” to changes
in local politics’ dynamics or changes in parties’ electoral strategy.
Regarding the issue of exclusivity, our interviews revealed contrasting perspectives.
One interviewee considers that it is most appropriate for mayors
to remain loyal to a single state legislator. However, others
admit that diversifying is an option, especially when the allied
legislator opposes the state governor and has less access to
resources – a similar dynamic was identified by Bezerra (1999).
