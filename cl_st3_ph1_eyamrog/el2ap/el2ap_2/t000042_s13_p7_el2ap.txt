Towards the end of 2020, many Brazilian scientists were hopeful
that vaccines would provide a silver bullet to end the
COVID-19 pandemic. Two vaccines became popular in the country: CoronaVac,
produced in China in partnership with Butantan (an institute based
in São Paulo, related to Doria´s government), and AstraZeneca, developed
with Fiocruz, a federal institution based in Rio de Janeiro.
Initially, Bolsonaro refused vaccines, especially Doria’s “Chinese” vaccine; later, he
was ambivalent, and still bragged about not being vaccinated himself.
Although he hesitantly participated in the COVAX-Facility— an initiative led
by the WHO to secure vaccines for developing countries—Bolsonaro opposed
an India-South Africa joint proposal submitted before the World Trade
Organization to lift patent restrictions on coronavirus vaccines.
