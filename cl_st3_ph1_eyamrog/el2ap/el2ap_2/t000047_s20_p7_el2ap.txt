After the wearing of the lab-coat in O-BT9 and O-BT10,
Social Actor 1 disappears, leaving Social Actor 2 behind. It
is at this point that Social Actor 2 sensitizes viewers
with a carton of Oral-B with the left hand. While
still holding the carton, Social Actor 1 reappears again to
intervene in order to form a synergy with Social Actor
2 in the promotion. One observes a turn-taking behavior at
this juncture (van Leeuwen, 2005). The position of exchange creates
cooperation between Social Actor 1 and Social Actor 2.
