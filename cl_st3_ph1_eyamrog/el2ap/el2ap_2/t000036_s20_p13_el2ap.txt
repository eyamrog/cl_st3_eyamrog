In this second group, primary information from pensions can be
added. Presidential decrees from 1928 mentioned pensions from 66 to
143 sucres monthly for a primary teacher, equivalent to the
average received in the last five years. Furthermore, wages paid
in Hacienda Tungurahua in 1928, in the amount of 60
sucres for doormen and stamp sellers (Official Gazette N.604 1928),
can give a clearer panorama of the income situation of
salaried workers and farmers.
