The minimum wage was established in a process of negotiations
between 1934 and 1937, during the presidency of Getúlio Vargas
(1930-1945). The Federative Republic of Brazil (1934), in the Constitution,
sanctioned the minimum wage as remuneration “capable of satisfying, according
to the conditions of each region, the normal needs of
the worker” (art. 121).
