Regarding the conversation translated into written modes, one observes that
the lexeme, You, operates as a deictic pointing to viewers
in a generic form as in You clean your teeth
every morning. Your teeth and your mouth are also parallel
in the generic application focusing the target audience in all
ramifications. The communicator employs the generic group to create a
connection with linguistic items such as long lasting fresh breath,
fresh feeling, and strong and healthy teeth in order to
illustrate the 2-IN-1 qualities entrenched in the Oral-B.
