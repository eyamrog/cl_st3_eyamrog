Mood states analyzed in the present study showed differences that
could be attributed to the match as an important temporal
reference for these changes. Time-perspective can be an important aspect
to be studied in terms of predict how these mood
states changes over time (Stolarski et al., 2019). The assessment
with two-day distance to the match revealed diverse mood states
during the present study. Other studies have shown a relationship
between the mood states of athletes and the time course
during a competitive period. Using the POMS at different time
points, Keikha et al.(2015) evaluated the mood states of university
athletes acting in different sports and showed that the mood
states profile of the participants was different only one day
before the competitions and remained stable when evaluated one hour
and one week before the competition (cf. Vega Marcos et
al., 2008). Hassm√©n and Blomstrand (1995) assessed the mood states
profile of soccer players with the POMS about one hour
before the match, immediately after a match and two hours
after a match and detected differences in the mood states
profile of the athletes between these different time points. These
differences were related to the results obtained by the team
in the matches evaluated.
