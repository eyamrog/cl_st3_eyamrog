The COVID-19 pandemic exposed structural weaknesses in India’s health system
and its social welfare system, such as the country’s failure
to provide universal health coverage and its inability to protect
the poor. Following the detection of the first case of
coronavirus on January 31—an Indian student in Wuhan who had
returned home to the southern state of Kerala—there were racial
attacks against migrants from Northeast India, a region that shares
borders with China. Individuals from Northeast India were scapegoated as
carriers of the novel coronavirus in metropolitan cities such as
New Delhi, Pune, Mumbai and Hyderabad.25 The novel coronavirus unleashed
a wave of Sinophobia and Islamophobia.
