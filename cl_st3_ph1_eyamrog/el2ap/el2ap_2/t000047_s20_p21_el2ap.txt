The grammatical communicative devices are: the generic you teeth, functional
about three times; and the mode, fresh, operational in the
variants of long lasting fresh breath, breath feeling, so fresh,
still fresh, and stay fresh. The text, strong, and smile
are other linguistic facilities that sustains to promote the teeth
feature. The communication unveils the word, strong, in the shade
of strong and healthy, helps strengthening, and stay strong; whereas
smile operates in three consecutive times. The modal consistency of
the blue and white schemes demonstrates an adventurous quality (Chiazzari,
1998; van Leeuwen, 2016). The stress laid on the smiles,
linguistic structures, and color pallets does not only give special
weight and distinction to Oral-B, the prominence and fame induce
viewers to give a unusual attention to the communication in
order to patronized the advertised product.
