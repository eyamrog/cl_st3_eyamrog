Policy statements have an immediate and a historical function. Immediately,
a policy statement may be used as a special expression
of the chancellor’s “Richtlinienkompetenz” (‘policy-making power’) (STÜWE, 2005, p.26–43), announcing
guidelines and programmes that are to discipline the entire coalition
government (Korte 2002, p.456). Historically, policy statements are also conceived
as documents in which the problematisation (or not) of particular
topics and the language used become primary sources for the
interpretation of the chancellor’s historical role (KORTE, 2002, p.457).
