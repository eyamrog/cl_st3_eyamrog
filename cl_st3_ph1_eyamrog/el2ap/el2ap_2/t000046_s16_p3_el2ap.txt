The research had the participation of 13 volunteers, observing the
following inclusion criteria: being a full-time professional of the REESP
for at least one year and working in the school
unit surveyed for at least one year. The participant that
provided insufficient data for data analysis would be excluded, which
did not occur. To collect multiple perspectives on the research
theme, at least one teacher from each area of knowledge
was sought, as well as the PE teacher and school
manager.
