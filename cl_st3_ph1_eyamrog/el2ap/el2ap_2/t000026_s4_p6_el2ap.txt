Despite presenting limitations, this research is one of the first
to investigate the correlation between anxiety and anxiolytic use in
university students from different health courses in the country, which
gives merit to the study. The results showed a frequency
ranging from moderate to high of state and trait anxiety
associated with the use of anxiolytic drugs among university students
in the health area. In view of this, it is
understood that the university is a favorable environment for health
promotion and, therefore, studies that evaluate anxiety and subsidize strategies
for its management should be encouraged in order to reduce
the need for medication use among students.
