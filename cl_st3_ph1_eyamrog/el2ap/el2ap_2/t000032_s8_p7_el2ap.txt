Mood states of soccer players have also been studied using
the PMSL (see Bueno & Souza, 2019 for a review).
Nogueira (2009) described the profile of Present Mood States as
a function of the positions of youth soccer players and
related to the competition phase. The results showed a common
profile of mood states for all athletes immediately before the
match, but differences between before and after the game, as
well as the presence of specific mood states for the
different positions of the athletes and the influence of the
match outcome on post-match mood states. Dias-Silva (2013) revealed a
common Present Mood States profile for soccer players and a
specific Present Mood State profile for their positions, which were
related to the behaviour of the players during the match.
