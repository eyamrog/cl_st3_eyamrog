Ames, Baker, and Rennó (2008) present evidence that voters, to
a good extent, choose candidates for the national legislature with
local concerns in mind, and prefer those with a recognized
ability to allocate resources to their localities. The electoral results
of this mutual support were also designated by Ames (1994)
as “reverse coattails effects”.
