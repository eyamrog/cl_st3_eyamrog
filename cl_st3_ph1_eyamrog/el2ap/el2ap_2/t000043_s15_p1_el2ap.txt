The quality assessment tool is an adaptation of the Newcastle
Ottawa Scale (19) for the quality assessment of cohort studies
as presented by Wachira and colleagues and considers the basic
assumptions of SCCS/SCRI (21). The proposal was adapted by V.W
and assessed by H.M and M.R. Two other scholars used
the tool in their systematic reviews studies (22,23).
