Another characteristic observed was that the specimens of the NÃºcleo
Curucutu have a more compact and globular inflorescence, while those
analyzed from other locations have a more lax inflorescence, as
in the case of the specimens analyzed from Bahia (according
to: L.A. Mattos Silva 3673), Rio de Janeiro (according to:
R. Mello-Silva 1230) and Santa Catarina (according to: Reitz &
Klein 4027).
