The understanding about how, when and why these feelings influence
athletes remains unclear and contradictory, with “a scarcity of empirical
evidence to support the timing, and content of psychological skill
application during the time preceding competition” (Hagan et al., 2017a).
For instance, Vega Marcos et al. (2008) described the mood
states profile of professional soccer players assessed with the POMS
in four precompetition events during the play-offs of a national
championship and did not find significant differences in this profile,
between the beginning and the end of the championship phase
period. This study suggests the stability of mood states along
time within the same championship phase. Torres-Luque, et al. (2013)
analyzed the relationship between the evolution of training load, days
of competition and mood states with the POMS in elite
judo athletes during a competitive period and detected effects of
training load and competitive cycles on mood states, Fatigue in
particular. In their study, Torres-Luque et al. (2013) extended the
evaluation of mood states to training sessions, without limiting it
to the days of competition. Box et al. (2018) examined
mood states during a consecutive 5-week fitness competition (CrossFit® Open)
involving five separate CrossFit® workouts. They data suggests that baseline
mood (in a controlled setting) and pre-workout mood did not
differ across the 5-weeks of the competition, In addition, they
found certain negative moods increases immediately following the workout (i.e.,
Fatigue), but these values declined to pre-workout values during recovery,
while feelings of Vigor remained elevated throughout the entire session.
