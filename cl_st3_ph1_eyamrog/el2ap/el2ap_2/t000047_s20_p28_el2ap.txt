The modal structure of Oral-B adâ€™s conversational modes, as shown
in the Total (vertical) aspect of Table 3, indicates that
there are mood and residue units. However, the residue scores
more points than the mood, as 15 points is obviously
attached to the complement. This seems to acknowledge the residue
of a clause as the rhematic aspect accommodating the core
of the message (Halliday & Matthiessen, 2014; Dalamu, 2018a).
