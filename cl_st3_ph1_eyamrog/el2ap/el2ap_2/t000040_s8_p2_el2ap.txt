According to its location and path, the IAN is at
risk during mandibular surgical procedures [4,5]. Any aggression to the
nervous bundle or ramifications may lead to a temporary/permanent loss
of tactile sensation of the lower lip and chin [4].
In a study with shocking results performed in 2005, Robert
et al. stated that 94.5% of surveyed California oral and
maxillofacial surgeons reported instances of injury to the IAN during
mandibular surgeries in a 12-month period [4]. Dimensions and paths
of the MC are important parameters which decisively contribute to
correct planning. Thus, an adequate preoperative visibility of the MC
can yield safer treatments with less IAN morbidity [6,7].
