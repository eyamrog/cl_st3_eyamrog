The 1930s was marked by the influence of political and
economic events that transformed the institutional structure of the country
and that, at the same time, behaved as the foundation
of a modernization that was not unique to the Ecuadorian
case, but that was introduced as part of the institutional
modernization models in Latin America. On the other hand, the
international crisis had a significant impact on the country's economic
stability, especially the stability of the export sectors. The Great
Depression created a context of deep political instability, in the
Ecuadorian case, within the 1930s, 12 people were registered as
head of the executive power in less than 10 years.
