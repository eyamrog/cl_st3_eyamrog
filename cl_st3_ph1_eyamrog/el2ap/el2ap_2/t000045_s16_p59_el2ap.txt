Normally here in the assembly you know the legislators that
serve by region. So let’s suppose that we receive a
request from a person who lives in [municipality]... then there
is a little book that you look at the region
and suggest the person look for that representative. Some things
are possible, we have already helped people here who are
not from our region (...). It’s just that we don't
open a wide range because we can’t handle it, the
demand is too large (Chief of Staff 8).
