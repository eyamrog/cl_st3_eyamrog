Hagan et al. (2017b) examined the competitive anxiety responses of
elite and semi- elite table tennis athletes as temporal events,
based on the multidimensional anxiety theory as a framework (i.e.
Martens et al., 1990) using the time-to-event paradigm. This paradigm
takes into account the closeness of a relevant event (for
instance, a championship match) as crucial aspect to modulate how
athletes feel before the competition. Present Mood States were closely
related to the different context conditions such as training load
(Torres-Luque et al., 2013), championship phase (Di Bonifácio, 2013; Vega
Marcos et al., 2008), perception of one’s performance (Lewis et
al., 2017), location of the match (R. C. da Silva,
2013), injury incidence (Olmedilla, Ortega & Gómez, 2014), sports performance
(Borges-Hernández, 2016) and match outcome (Hassmén & Blomstrand, 1995; Nogueira,
2009).
