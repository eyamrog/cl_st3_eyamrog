The collected material was incorporated to HCSTR collection, acronym according
to Thiers 2022, which is constantly updated. The specimens were
identified with the help of specialized literature and examinations by
specialists. The floristic list was ordered alphabetically by family and
species and the circumscription of botanical families followed the proposal
of "Angiosperm Phylogeny Group" (APG IV 2016). In order to
check the writing of scientific names, the electronic databases of
Flora do Brasil (BFG 2021) and Tropicos (http://www.tropicos.org) were consulted.
