“Since I have physicians in my house, health is very
strict, starting from childhood with my children. My husband wouldn’t
let it get pacifier out of the fridge, it had
to be kept in the fridge. Health is the basis
of control. Yesterday I just took a vaccine, as I
told you, due to my husband, we see all the
time that it is important to take the vaccine, but
we wait and, as I said at the beginning, in
my house has a great importance, since my two children
and my husband are physicians. My health, I’m 60, I
consider it good. I have no problems and I try
to pass this to the students, based on the diet,
and in physical exercises. I did ballet for 10 years,
classical ballet, I had a dance academy and ballet, and
this, art covers this area of dance, which is very
important physical activity. I think it is a very important
subject in school, which should never be cut” (Daniela –
Art teacher).
