Evaluation is a widely debated and controversial topic in the
educational field. On the one hand, it appears that a
general agreement has been reached, according to which evaluating is
a complex action and it requires observation, documentation, and consideration
to improve the educational approach. On the other hand, there
are objections related to a more traditionalist perspective, which still
considers evaluation as a mere practice aimed at judging the
performances (Vertecchi, 2016).
