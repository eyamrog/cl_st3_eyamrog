At this juncture therefore the question of ‘what is mode?’
still arises. Considering van Leeuwen (2005) to take the lead,
a mode is an interactional resource, which meaning potential resides
and engulfs in historical treasures, current cultures, and future norms.
Jewitt (2009) adds that a mode represents a semiotic resource
of meaning-making, entwined with a cultural background. Some of these
communicative resources, as Jewitt (2009) reverberates, are images, writings, gestures,
and postures. Nevertheless, Kress (2010) describes a mode from the
informal and formal perspectives. The informal view is social; whereas
the formal viewpoint is seemingly academic. In Kress’ (2010) sense,
the former, tagged as being informal, connects the social where
a community determines the address given to a mode. A
social group, in this regard, determines the efficacy of a
mode’s subject matter, making a mode geographically-oriented.
