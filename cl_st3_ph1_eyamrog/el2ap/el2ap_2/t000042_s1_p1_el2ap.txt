We draw on Cameroonian philosopher Achille Mbembe’s concept of necropolitics
to examine government responses to the first year of the
COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil and India, two middle-income nations not
commonly compared. The article describes the role played by President
Jair Bolsonaro and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in aggravating the
pandemic. Bolsonaro scorned medical advice and framed COVID-19 as a
“little flu.” Conversely, Modi formally embraced social distancing and a
nationwide lockdown. Despite differences between Brazilian and Indian approaches to
COVID-19, in both countries discriminated people tended to remained invisible.
This article argues that India’s and Brazil’s divergent responses to
the COVID-19 emergency was a matter of degree and not
of kind in regulating a necropolitical policy that considered some
citizens as expendable: blacks and Indigenous people from the Amazon,
in the case of Brazil; and in the case of
India the sizable Muslim minority, marginalized Hindu castes and migrant
workers. Whereas deaths due to COVID-19 attracted voluminous international media
attention, the deaths of disenfranchised people in Brazil and India
received insufficient attention and the perception of their condition has
assimilated into the common trope that developing countries are unable
to protect themselves as they should.
