In the Senate, on November 26, 1934, the definitive draft
of the Minimum Wage Law was achieved. These results indicate
that the process of elaborating the legislation on the minimum
wage was truncated. No progress was made in the 1934-1935
juncture towards the final phase of enactment of the law,
“the fact that wage fixes responded to agreements between the
parties until 1936 reflected a legal vacuum linked to the
weak capacity to elaborate wage legislation for the industrial sector
during the politically unstable period from 1931 to 1935” (Creamer
2018: 36).
