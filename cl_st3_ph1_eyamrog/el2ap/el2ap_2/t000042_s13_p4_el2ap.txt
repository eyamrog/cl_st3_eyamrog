Two Ministers of Health—Luiz Henriquez Mandetta and Nelson Teich— were
forced out of their positions on April 16 and May
15, 2020 respectively. Both insisted that more studies be conducted
before deciding whether or not to approve HCQ as a
tool to fight the pandemic.17 After Teich’s resignation, Bolsonaro appointed
active-duty Army General Eduardo Pazuello—a man with no experience in
health care—as the new Minister of Health and staffed the
Ministry with military officials who would carry out his orders
without hesitation. When Pazuello assumed his new position, the number
of confirmed cases rose above the one-million mark, making Brazil
the second country after the US in terms of total
case-numbers. Contradicting the WHO, Pazuello dismissed tracing policies, electing instead
to only test patients in hospitals, and made HCQ the
main medicinal resource. He and Bolsonaro pressured ANVISA, the independent
Health Regulatory Agency, to authorize chloroquine bought from India for
COVID-19, and instructed the army laboratory to produce over a
million chloroquine tablets in a few weeks. Bolsonaro also tried
to hide information on coronavirus deaths (by only reporting new
daily case-numbers rather than fatality-numbers).18
