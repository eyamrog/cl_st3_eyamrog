3. Exploration. This category includes all the behaviours with which
a child not only detects and briefly observes a phenomenon
but explores it by activating behaviours that indicate the intention
to deepen the knowledge, to understand "how it works"; this,
too, in view of the achievement of an objective outside
the cognitive one. An example is Alice trying to get
a piece of cellotape but can not tear it. She
tries pulling harder and observes that the tape stretches but
does not tear. Try to rip it off with your
teeth (if I pull harder or bite with my teeth,
it will tear) but she realizes it fails and puts
it back in the box holding the roll of cardboard
in her hand.
