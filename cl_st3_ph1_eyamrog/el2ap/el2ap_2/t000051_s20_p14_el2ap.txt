The second of Scholz’s course of action is “to divert
Putin from his path of war”. Here, Scholz lists the
sanctions against Russia and, using the contractive strategy of counter,
concedes that Putin will not change course overnight, but argues
that an effect will be seen very soon, reaffirmed by
the pronouncement “ohne irgendwelche Denkverbote” (‘no thought whatsoever is prohibited’).
The Putin’s war discourse is manifest again through the very
pronouncement “gehört es deutlich ausgesprochen: Dieser Krieg ist Putins Krieg”
(‘it must be clearly stated that this war is Putin’s
war!’) as well as the judgement that it is a
“Konflikt zwischen Putin und der freien Welt” (‘conflict between Putin
and the free world’), which establishes a morally compelling “with
us or against us” situation similar to the one constructed
by George W. Bush after 9/11.
