Self-Controlled Case Series (SCCS) and Self-Controlled Risk Interval (SCRI) study
designs are types of studies where cases act as their
controls. They are commonly used by pharmacovigilance to study rare
events. There is no existing tool for the assessment of
the methodological quality of such studies. Critical appraisal in primary
and secondary studies is crucial as it enables the reader
to evaluate how the study was elaborated and take this
into consideration while analyzing the evidence presented. This paper presents
a proposal of an instrument that has been adapted from
an already existing tool used for cohort studies and it
combines the elements of this tool and the premises of
the SCCS and SCRI study designs. It is expected that
the tool will help researchers and readers in critically appraising
SCCS and SCRI study designs.
