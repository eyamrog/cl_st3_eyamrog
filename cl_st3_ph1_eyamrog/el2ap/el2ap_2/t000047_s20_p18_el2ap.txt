It is worth stressing that the appearance of Oral-B in
upper right corner of the LLM spheres and other visible
places are an indicator of two specific functions. One, Oral-B
is the focus of the ad. Two, the designer intends
to impress Oral-B in the cognitive process of viewers. A
keen observation suggests that Social Actors 1 and 2 are
a single individual, who acts two different roles, as computer-mediation
characteristic has enabled such functions. In corollary, the dual roles
are thoughtfully deliberate. This is a metaphor that creates a
relationship between the actor and Oral-B. That is, as the
actor from the dental institute is 2-IN-1, so also is
Oral-B 2-IN-1. That is what Williamson (2002) constructs as interchangeability
of semiotic resources. One might moreover add that the present
of the toothbrush and toothpaste, being products of joint demand,
are characteristic of 2-IN-1.
