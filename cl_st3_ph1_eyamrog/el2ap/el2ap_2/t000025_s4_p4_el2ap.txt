The topical therapies with positive results reported by randomized clinical
trials were lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5%, morphine gel 0.2% as analgesics, metronidazole
0.8% solution, and polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) with betaine 0.1% solution,
octenidine solution, honey, and silver as antimicrobials. Moreover, the combination
of topical therapies on the wound bed, periwound skin, and
the application of techniques of dressing change aiming at pain
prevention can potentially improve the painful experience in people with
MFWs (Figure 3).
