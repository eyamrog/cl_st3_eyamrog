Mechanism involved in MFW-related pain is complex and multifactorial because
of the omnipresence of infection due to high local microbial
load (Vardhan et al., 2019), irritation of exposed nerve endings
(trauma at dressing changes), tumor growth (pressure compressing on body
structures), and edema (impaired lymphatic and capillary drainage). In consequence,
patients may experience nociceptive, neuropathic, inflammatory, or mixed pain, depending
on the trigger (EONS, 2015; Naylor, 2001).
