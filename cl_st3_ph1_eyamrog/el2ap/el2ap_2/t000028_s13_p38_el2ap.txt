With those parameters, the website generated 74 results: three CEIs
(Child Education Centers), 54 EMEFs (Municipal Elementary Schools) and 17
EMEIs (Municipal Nursery Schools). In order to discover which English
language textbook is the most chosen for the sixth grade,
solely the EMEF data was computed and analyzed, because the
compulsory teaching of English language begins only in elementary schools,
from the sixth grade on.
