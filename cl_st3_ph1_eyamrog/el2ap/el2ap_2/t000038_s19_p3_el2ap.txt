We present item factor loadings in Table 2. We also
report the estimates of replicability of factor scores (H-index). This
index evaluates how well a set of items represents a
common factor (Ferrando e Lorenzo-Seva 2018). High H values (>.80)
suggest a well-defined latent variable, which is more likely to
be stable across studies; low H values indicate a poorly
defined latent variable, which is likely to change across studies
(Ferrando e Lorenzo-Seva 2018).
