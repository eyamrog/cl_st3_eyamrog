By analyzing recent didactic materials and textbooks, it is possible
to observe that most of them present a lot of
visual elements and multimodal texts, such as images, drawings, maps
and posters. Although those elements are important in the education,
language teaching materials do not need to be solely visual
(TEACHING LANGUAGES TO BLIND AND VISUALLY IMPAIRED STUDENTS, 2022), as
there are other options of teaching methods that encompass non-sighted
students as well.
