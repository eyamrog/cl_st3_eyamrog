In the search to understand how gestures can help in
teaching in STEM, Stieff, Lira, and Scopelitis (2016), from Chicago
(USA), describe two studies that verified the impact on teaching
when students used gestures to support their thinking in space
in STEM content. In the first study, the effectiveness of
watching and reproducing gestures or reading a text was compared.
In the second study, the effectiveness of the gesture was
compared with an instructional approach that involved the handling of
concrete models, but without gestures. The results indicated that gestures
can be an effective strategy to support students' spatial thinking
in STEM subjects because, with the use of gestures, students
performed significantly better than without gestures.
