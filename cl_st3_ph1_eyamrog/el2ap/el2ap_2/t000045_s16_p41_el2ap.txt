Our interviews suggest that the relationship between state legislators and
mayors does not take the form of a top-down process
in which bosses decide what, how, and to whom to
offer benefits. This is because local brokers also play an
active role in this relationship. Although occasionally the legislatorsâ€™ office
plays an active role in offering benefits, the requests coming
from the municipalities predominate. They come in large volumes throughout
the year, in line with evidence from Bezerra (1999).
