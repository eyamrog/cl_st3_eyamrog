Due to the lack of papers in Applied Linguistics journals,
we opted for searching texts on the Scientific Electronic Library
Online (SciELO) platform. Using the research strategies available, the texts
resulting in the investigation present in their title the word
“blind” and also include the words “teaching” and “school” in
their title, abstract or keywords. In addition, some research filters
were applied: a) the journal of publication should be related
to education; b) the texts should be open access; c)
within the genre category (Tipos de Literatura), the texts should
be either articles or review articles. This search resulted in
nine papers.
