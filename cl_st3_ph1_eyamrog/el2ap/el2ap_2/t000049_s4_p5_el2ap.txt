Similarly, in this perspective, the researcher and supervisors must be
willing to welcome hypotheses that emerge from the analysis of
the data collected, though always maintaining the scientific coherence of
the project. This consideration leads to reflecting on and enhancing
the workgroup intended as an organism able to welcome new
hypotheses by promoting confrontation. Obviously, each workgroup has to undergo
a proper professional training that enhances dialogue, confrontation, auto- evaluation
as a fundamental instrument to “rule” and guide the educational
act. Therefore, the training has to prepare teachers capable of
conducting research with the children, willing to face the emotional
challenge and uncertainty that this process entails and able to
handle the doubts and waiting without giving in to the
desire to explain, transmit concepts, and suggest specific activities that
do not consider the children’s interests.
