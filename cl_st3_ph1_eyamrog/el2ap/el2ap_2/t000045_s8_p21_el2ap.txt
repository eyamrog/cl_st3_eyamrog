While part of the literature sees brokers as party agents
embedded in large and dense networks typical of political machines
(Stokes et al., 2013), others argue that a more diverse
profile of brokers can be found in more fluid and
poorly institutionalized party systems (Aspinall, 2014; Muñoz, 2014; Mares and
Young, 2016). Brokers might be driven by political, ethnic, religious,
or territorial loyalties, guided by long-term material benefits, seek more
immediate material rewards (Aspinall, 2014), or they can also be
focused on the interests of their groups (Holland and Palmer-Rubin,
2015). Moreover, brokers might not have any ties to parties
and organizations and behave as free agents, switching allegiances in
the same election (Muñoz, 2014, Aspinall, 2014; Novaes, 2018).
