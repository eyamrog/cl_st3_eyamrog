According to Qiu et al. (2020), CPDI inquired about the
frequency of 22 factors (Anger; Anxiety; Negative Mood; Irritableness; Exhaustion;
Sluggishness; Helplessness; Avoidance; Indecisiveness; Sleeplessness; Poor Appetite; Distrust; Physical Symptoms;
Bladder and Bowel; Obsessive Behavior; Insecurity; Fear; Sadness; Spread Negative
News; Social function; Lack of Judgement; Attention Deficit). Shanghai Mental
Health Center Psychiatrists verified the CPDI content validity. The Cronbachâ€™s
alpha of CPDI is 0.95 (p<0.001) (Qiu et al. 2020).
This research aims to empirically derive the factor structure of
the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI).
