Utterances are shaped both by past uses of particular discourses
as well as by envisaged future uses (VOLOSHINOV, 1973 [1929],
p.86), so that “all discourse is in dialogue with prior
discourses on the same subject, as well as with discourses
yet to come, whose reactions it foresees and anticipates” (TODOROV,
1984, p.x). Discourses that relate to the anticipation of a
response are called the not-yet-spoken and discourses that consist of
previous utterances about the topic are called the already-spoken (MORSON
& EMERSON, 1990, p.137). A discourse is here understood as
“a system of meaning—a set of propositions that cohere around
a given object of meaning” (BAXTER, 2011, p.2). In any
utterance, discourses are in competition “when the meanings they advance
negate one another in some way” (BAXTER, 2011, p.2).
