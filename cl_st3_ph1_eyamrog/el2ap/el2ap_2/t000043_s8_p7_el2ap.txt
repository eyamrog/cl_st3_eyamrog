The Self-controlled risk interval (SCRI) is a variant of a
SCCS design where cases also act as their own controls.
There is a risk period and a control interval. The
control period is either before or after the exposure. The
SCRI design has a reduced control interval, for example, in
the case of vaccines, after the risk period is determined,
a selected short period is selected before or after vaccination
and close to the risk period. The reduced control interval
is chosen to avoid time-confounding issues like age and seasonality.
The control interval is usually similar to the risk period
(13,14). For example, in a study to evaluate the adverse
events following varicella vaccine in Taiwan, the risk interval was
day 1 to day 42 after vaccination and the control
interval was the period between day 43 to day 84
post vaccination (15).
