The analysis has two steps. In the first step, I
identify already-spoken and not- yet-spoken discourses in the speech through
a thematic analysis. These discourses can be manifest or latent;
while manifest discourses are explicitly introduced, latent discourses appear as
unspoken presuppositions, assumptions that are taken for granted (BAXTER, 2011,
p.158–159). Latent discourses can be identified by asking “What does
a listener need to know in order to render this
textual segment intelligible? What sociocultural and interpersonal discourses need to
be invoked to understand what this textual segment means?” (BAXTER,
2011:, p.159). I will draw on Appraisal Theory’s resources of
attitude (MARTIN & WHITE, 2005, p.42), as they can indicate
what is regarded as typical or normal: “When a judgement
is made in talk, it is grounded in an often
unstated discursive system of meaning” (BAXTER, 2011, p.160). Both already-
spoken and not-yet-spoken discourses can be proximal or distal: while
proximal ones are spoken by directly involved parties, distal ones
are utterances circulating in culture at large, spoken “by cultural
members other than the parties of a given relationship” (BAXTER,
2011, p.53).
