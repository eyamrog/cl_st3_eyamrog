In the case of Chile, the labor code was approved
on May 13, 1931, through which minimum wages were regulated
based on negotiations carried out between commissions. A commission made
up of three representatives of the group of workers; and,
another commission made up of three representatives of the business
and industrial sectors. These commissions would regulate the condition of
the minimum wage and stipulate the resolution of conflicts with
the General Labor Inspector (Vergara 2014).
