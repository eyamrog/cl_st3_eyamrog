In general, whether for logistical or structural reasons, the prosthetic
rehabilitation of this population has until now been extremely challenging,
due to the difficulty in transporting patients from the villages
to urban centers to undergo treatment22. While DSEI Bahia has
Primary Oral Health teams in all villages, a dental prosthetics
service is not offered. In Aldeia Velha, despite its proximity
to urban centers, older adults do not leave the village
to seek prosthetic rehabilitation.
