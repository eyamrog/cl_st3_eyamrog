For data collection, the semi-structured interview was performed, which is
one of the main ways for data collection for Triviños
(2008), valuing the presence of the researcher and allowing the
participant the freedom to expose their ideas, thus making the
research richer in detail. The interview script was based on
understanding the definition of health and its relation with PE.
Data were collected between March and May 2019, and the
school unit was visited 10 times during this period. The
interviews were conducted in a reserved and private place in
the school: management rooms, pedagogical coordination and/or the teachers’ room,
being present only the researcher and the teacher. With the
consent of the teachers, the interviews were recorded and later
transcribed to an electronic file for analysis.
