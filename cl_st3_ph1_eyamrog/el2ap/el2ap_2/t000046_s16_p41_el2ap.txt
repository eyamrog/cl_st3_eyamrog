“[...] by PE I conquer health, what is PE? It’s
playing, it’s mental and body health, through playful games, I
can make this connection. Sometimes we play “queimada” or even
soccer, or a wheel, a “cotia” wheel in my classes,
and then the child is exercising, working the physical side
and is still taking care of his own health, both
mental and physical” (Sofia – Manager).
