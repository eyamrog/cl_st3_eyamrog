HLMA4 shows social actors and a movement of the white
sparkling content of Oral-B, as the product rolls from up
to down to attract customers. Social Actor 3 touches her
teeth in order to acknowledge cleanliness, strength, and long lasting
fresh breath of the advertised product. The advertiser culminates the
message with Smile, Smile, Smile to signify the end result
of using Oral-B. In addition, colour and musical tunes attract
and excite viewers to patronize Oral-B.
