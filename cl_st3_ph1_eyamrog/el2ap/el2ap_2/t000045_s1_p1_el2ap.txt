In Brazil, politicians at different levels cooperate to achieve electoral
and governing goals. Recently, these relationships have come to be
analyzed through theories of brokers developed in comparative politics. This
article investigates the micro-foundations of alliances between state representatives and
local politicians and asks to what extent those theories are
adequate to analyze these relationships in Brazil. Our analysis combines
data from surveys with state representatives and interviews with advisors
and focuses on how alliances are built, maintained, and broken.
We show that mayors and city councilors are important brokers
for state representatives. However, the fact that legislators and local
brokers do not hold static positions and play dual roles
underscores the limits of principal-agent theories to describe and analyze
these relationships. Based on our conclusions, we suggest pathways to
advance our understanding of the dynamics of interest intermediation and
the multilevel connections between political actors.
