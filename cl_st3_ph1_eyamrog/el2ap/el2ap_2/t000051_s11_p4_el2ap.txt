In Bakhtinian dialogism, where speakers enter into a dialogical relationship
with “the alien horizon of the understanding receiver” (BAKHTIN, 1981,
p.282) constructing their utterances against the listener’s background, the “listener
(real or imagined) shapes the utterance from the outset” (MORSON
& EMERSON, 1990, p.129). Therefore, the discursive power enacted in
policy statements should be analysed not only regarding the immediate
function and addressees, who are brought into line and whose
potential reactions are anticipated, but also regarding the historical function,
that is, how it speaks to perceived future addressees that
may evaluate the role of the speaking chancellor in the
discursive construction of historical reality in the future. For this
purpose, a dialogic perspective is well-suited, as I argue in
the next section.
