The coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is one of the most significant
health challenges on a global scale this century. By 2022,
two years after the outbreak in China in late 2019,
there had been more than 62 million deaths worldwide from
COVID-19. As no one can predict how the pandemic will
evolve, this can lead the population to experience stress, fear,
and anguish for a long time (Danese et al. 2020).
Previous research has revealed a profound and wide range of
psychosocial impacts on people at the individual levels during the
outbreak of infection (Abad et al. 2020). People are likely
to experience fear of falling sick or dying, feelings of
helplessness, and stigma (Wang et al. 2020).
