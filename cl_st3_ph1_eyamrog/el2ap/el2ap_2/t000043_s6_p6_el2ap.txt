The SCCS and SCRI are important study designs in pharmacoepidemiology
and are useful in studying rare events reported after transient
exposures, a good example are the influenza vaccines and the
development of GBS. This paper presents a first proposal of
a quality assessment tool for such studies. This came after
the authors necessity to evaluate the methodological quality of such
designs a few years back and no instrument was found,
thus, the authors adapted an already existing tool and took
into consideration the premises of SCCS/SCRI to design the tool.
It is expected that the tool may guide researchers in
assessing the methodological rigor of SCCS/SCRI study designs especially now
with the Covid-19 pandemic where these designs could be widely
used especially in studying the events being reported after the
administration of the Covid-19 vaccines.
