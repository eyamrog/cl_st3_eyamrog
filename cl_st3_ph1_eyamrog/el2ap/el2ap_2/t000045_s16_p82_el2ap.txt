Our empirical findings and their interpretation are based on how
the institutional design established in 1988 in Brazil distributes power,
resources, and authority, horizontally and vertically, among the branches and
the entities of the federation. Many studies have highlighted how
Brazilian institutions produce a complex system of crossed responsibilities, marked
by asymmetries of various kinds, a mix of autonomy and
dependency, and simultaneous incentives for cooperation and competition. This is
reflected in the career incentives for politicians – who do
not necessarily work towards national careers (Samuels, 2003; Santos; Pegurier,
2011) – and in many ways in which politicians at
different levels connect, articulate, and cooperate to solve problems, implement
policies, and pursue electoral goals. We cannot characterize these relationships
as horizontal, but it is neither possible to speak of
rigid hierarchies.
