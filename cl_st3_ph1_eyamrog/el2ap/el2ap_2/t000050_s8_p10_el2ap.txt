Entomological research within the SIL was carried out by us
in order to contribute to the understanding of the transmission
dynamics of ACL as there was an increase in the
number of cases of ACL recorded among the Suruwaha between
2010 and 2012. Our investigation found that this increase was
likely related to the distribution to the entire community of
flashlights in late 2010, as requested by the Suruwaha themselves.
This seems to be the main cause of the increase
in ACL, as it led to changes in the hunting
habits of the Suruwaha from strictly diurnal to nocturnal, and
coincides with the generally crepuscular and nocturnal biting activity of
the blood-feeding female sand flies that transmit ACL.
