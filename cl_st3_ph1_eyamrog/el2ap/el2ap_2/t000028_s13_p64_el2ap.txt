One group or pair at a time, students should answer
the question “which month…?”, requested by the EAL teacher (examples:
Which month starts the summer in Brazil? Which month are
we in now? Which month is Halloween celebrated?). The teacher
can ask students to take turns among the members of
the groups, so as to achieve everyone’s participation, as well
as to interact within the groups to provide an appropriate
answer. Like the first proposal, this adaptation would work with
listening and speaking skills, functioning as a playful and ludic
activity with the purpose to encourage participation and inclusion.
