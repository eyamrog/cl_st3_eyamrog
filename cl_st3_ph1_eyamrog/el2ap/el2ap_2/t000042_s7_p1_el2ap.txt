The governmental responses to COVID-19 in several developing countries is
analyzed by use of Achille Mbembe's concept of “Necropolitics.”1 Seen
from the viewpoint of Necropolitics, neoliberal governments implemented during the
pandemic an Orwellian version of sovereignty which meant the management
of life and death—allowing the proliferation of disease and increases
in mortality numbers and the rate of infection among discriminated
and marginalized populations.2 Drawing on newspaper articles, internet documents, contemporary
publications and public health information in Brazil and India, this
article will describe and compare the necropolitical dynamics in both
countries. The authors contend that governmental responses in Brazil and
India during the first year of the pandemic (c. February
2020-March 2021) were a regulated form necropolitics that intensified or
declined in accordance with political contexts and mortality figures, eventually
making mortality palatable to public opinion.3 The Brazilian and Indian
heads of state (Jair Bolsonaro and Narendra Modi) implemented decisions
regarding who should live and who should die during the
pandemic and portrayed the outcome of high mortality as fortuitous,
i.e., not a state responsibility. Despite divergences in Brazil and
India’s responses to COVID-19 —for example, Bolsonaro’s characterization of the
coronavirus as “a little flu” and Modi’s advocacy of a
European-inspired lockdown— both approaches led to a public health disaster.4
The two leaders also presented other similarities.
