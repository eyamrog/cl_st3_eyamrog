A few years later, in 1937, the salary was legalized
for the entire private sector. This time the salary was
divided according to geographical areas: 300, 350, and 400 pesos
per month. In the case of the municipality of Santiago,
the minimums were established at 12 pesos per day for
temporary workers and 13 pesos for the group of permanent
workers. As can be seen in tables 8 and 9,
the salary in US dollars fluctuated between 4.24 and 15.72,
while the lower limit was 8 for the group of
workers made up of minors, older adults and workers with
disabilities.
