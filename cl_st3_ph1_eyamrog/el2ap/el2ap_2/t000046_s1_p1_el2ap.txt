The aim was to analyze the understanding of health and
its relation with physical education from the perspective of teachers
and managers of a public school of the state of
SÃ£o Paulo. It is a descriptive research, with a qualitative
approach. Eleven teachers two coordinators were volunteers. Data were produced
using semi-structured interviews and data analysis by non-aprioristic categories. Health
was understood, mainly, based on the perspective of well-being, as
well as the realization of body practices as a link
between physical education and health in the school context. Thus,
physical education has a promising path to meet the critical
pedagogies regarding the approach to health, especially in the confrontation
with the active lifestyle.
