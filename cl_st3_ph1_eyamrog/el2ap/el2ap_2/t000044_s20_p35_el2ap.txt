In the classroom, when a student swings his arm wildly
when the teacher asks a question; or another tries not
to make eye contact with the teacher, both are using
their bodies to tell the teacher that they want to
answer the question. These body movements constitute what is normally
called non- verbal communication (Goldin-Meadow, 2017).
