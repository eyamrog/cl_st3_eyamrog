5. Detection of the problem. This category is very similar
to the previous one because it implies a process that
falls within the frame of Deweyâ€™s investigation process. The aspect
that characterizes the behaviours that fall into this category is
represented by the fact that the children, during their explorations
on the material available, encounter a problem that puts them
in front of a 'hitch' or a dilemma. This condition
puts the child in front of a frustrating situation because
his research remains 'blocked' by a problem 'imposed' by external
reality. The problematic situation is such when the child explicitly
identifies the hitch that puts him in difficulty and tries
to overcome it. An example is shown below.
