This understanding is also in the BNCC, when it states
that the student should “take advantage of body practices autonomously
to enhance involvement in leisure contexts, expand sociability networks and
health promotion” (BRASIL, 2017, p.223). However, it is necessary to
take this interpretation from a behavioral perspective (lifestyle change) to
a socio-environmental conception, which, for Westphal (2013), is consolidated in
collective strategies of population empowerment, promotion of healthy spaces and
development of skills, knowledge and attitudes.
