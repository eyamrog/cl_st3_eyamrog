Moreover, as we have already pointed out, these studies tend
to rely on the assumptions of principal-agent models. In order
to apply this framework, one should clearly identify who performs
the role of principal and who performs the role of
agent (Gailmard, 2012, p. 4). Our analysis shows that state
representatives and brokers do not occupy static positions and move
around in time and space, playing a dual role. As
the boss, a legislator is the leading actor who expects
local actors to act in favor of her electoral success.
To encourage brokers, she provides incentives, such as assigning discretionary
budget resources to municipalities and fulfilling mayors’ and councilors’ requests.
In this position, she is subject to the risks inherent
to this relationship. However, since mayors and councilors are also
politicians with elective offices, a shift in time converts legislators
from principals to agents, ready to mobilize voters in municipal
elections. Another distinctive aspect of this relationship, not captured in
most analyses, is that representatives need to mobilize voters to
ensure the political survival of those who once acted as
their brokers. In other words, the role of principal or
agent is defined by the function exercised in this relationship,
which varies in time and space and cannot necessarily be
inferred by the position occupied in the country’s elected-offices structure.
