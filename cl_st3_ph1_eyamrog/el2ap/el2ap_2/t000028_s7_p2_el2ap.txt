In order to be comprehended by sighted students, teachers of
English as an Additional Language (EAL) usually make use of
visual materials, such as pictures, photos, videos, flash cards, maps
and posters. Although these materials act as realia and help
learners to understand the English language, they need adaptation to
be used by non-sighted students. These students require a tangible
or audible exemplar of the didactic material, which can be
examined through other senses (RESOURCES FOR TEACHING ENGLISH AS A
SECOND LANGUAGE TO LEARNERS WITH BLINDNESS OR VISUAL IMPAIRMENT, 2022).
