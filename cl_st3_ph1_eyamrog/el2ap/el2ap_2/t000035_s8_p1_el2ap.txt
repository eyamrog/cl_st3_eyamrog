Indigenous Brazilians are made up of different peoples, who have
lived in the country since before the Portuguese colonization1. At
this time, it was estimated that indigenous populations totaled around
five million people2, although these numbers have suffered drastic reductions
over the centuries, due to the affliction by diseases brought
by Europeans and conflicts with colonizers. The last census conducted
by IBGE (the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) in
2010 found there were 896,900 indigenous people in the country,
from 305 ethnic groups, speaking 274 languages1.
