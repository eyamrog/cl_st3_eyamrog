Twenty-two patients were selected in phase I of the project,
though one did not attend the fabrication of the dentures,
two were rehabilitated with partial dentures and one did not
attend the 1-year reevaluation, stating that he did not use
the dentures as he had thought implants were to be
installed. Thus, based on the exclusion criteria, the present study
involved nineteen people in phase I (four rehabilitated with upper
dentures and fifteen with double dentures) and eighteen people in
phase IV.
