In particular, in order to identify educational strategies and functions
performed by the adult that are coherent with the ‘promotion
from within’ approach, Bondioli’s and Savio’s (1996, 2001) categories were
considered. They highlighted the importance of an intervention style that
does not prevaricate but enhances the child’s interests and perspectives
instead. In particular, the adult ‘reflects’ of the child’s verbal
and non-verbal behaviors without judging. He also asked open questions
that allowed a vast range of possible answers and introduced
new elements (materials or activities) coherent with what the child
or group was doing.
