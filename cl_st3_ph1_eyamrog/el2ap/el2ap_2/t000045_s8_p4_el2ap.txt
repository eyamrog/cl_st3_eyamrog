In addition, our analysis draws attention to a different variety
of brokers that is not highlighted in recent studies on
the topic. Few studies in the recent comparative literature investigate
the role that elective officeholders at the local level play
as brokers (Stokes et al., 2013; Camp, 2015) or explore
in depth their peculiarities. In general, tend they focus on
party activists (Stokes et el. 2013), activists driven by political,
ethnic, or religious loyalties (Aspinall, 2014), community leaders with or
without party ties (Zarazaga, 2014; Holland & Palmer-Rubin, 2015), and
independent brokers hired to act exclusively in the election period
(Mu√±oz, 2014).
