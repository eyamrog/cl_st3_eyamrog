Regarding the analysis of the adult’s intervention, I will cite
an example from the table below to demonstrate how the
researcher performed support actions and strategies to promote and develop
the scientific attitudes in children after they solicited him. Even
in this scenario, the choice of strategies and functions performed
by the adult was influenced by the idea of evaluation
intended as an instrument to “control” the coherence between pedagogical
basis, objectives to achieve, and educational choices.
