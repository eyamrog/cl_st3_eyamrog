The research planning – briefly described here – and the
educational strategies performed by the adult are connected to John
Dewey’s (1933; 1938) theoretical contributions regarding the inquiry process, to
Vygotsky’s (1930; 1934) concept of “zone of proximal development” and
Bruner’s scaffolding. Moreover, the contribution of Susan Isaacs (1930, 1933)
was particularly useful because, with her experience at Malting House,
she effectively interpreted Dewey’s theory and the psychoanalytic one in
an expressly pedagogical sense.
