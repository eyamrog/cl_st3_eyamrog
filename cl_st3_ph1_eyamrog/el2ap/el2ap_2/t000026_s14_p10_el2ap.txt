The data obtained were organized in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet
through double typing and later validation to control for possible
errors and later exported and analyzed in the software Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25.0 so that
the sociodemographic and clinical profile data were characterized by absolute
and relative percentage frequencies (descriptive statistics). The Kolmogorovâ€’ Smirnov test
with Lilliefors correlation was used to verify the normality assumption.
