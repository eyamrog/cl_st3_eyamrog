One of the main ways representatives can benefit their localities
and local politicians is by allocating resources through pork barrel
budget amendments, following demands from mayors and other local actors3.
A second way is by providing their allies with information
and access to government agencies (especially the Executive branch) and
supporting them in solving bureaucratic problems (Bezerra, 1999; Carvalho, 2003,
p. 152). According to the legislators, the volume of resources
allocated to municipalities is the main criterion used by local
leaders to evaluate legislators’ performance (Bezerra, 1999). Bezerra (1999) reports
that although representatives often express a negative view of the
activities mentioned above, they justify the attention devoted to local
affairs by the expectations of voters – an aspect corroborated
by Ricci and Lemos (2011) based on surveys conducted with
national representatives.
