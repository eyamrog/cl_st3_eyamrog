Through searching on journal platforms for works concerning the EAL
learning-teaching process of blind students, it is possible to observe
the lack of discussion of this theme within the Applied
Linguistics area, which indicates the lack of research on the
theme and also interferes in the teachersâ€™ search for forms
of adaptations. Such an issue reinforces the importance of conducting
research on adapted didactic materials for blind students, exposing tangible
and audible options to be used for that audience.
