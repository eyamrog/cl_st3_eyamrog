The Putin’s war discourse reoccurs here. Scholz’s stated aim is
to distinguish the will of the Russian people, assumed to
align with the Western free-world viewpoint, from that of its
president, thus isolating him. On a more hidden level, it
also attempts to simplify the conflict by casting it into
a binary good vs evil scheme and thus anticipates potentially
complicating views that defend the Russian move historically. The discourse
is latent through a combination of affect (“verzweifelten Lage”, ‘desperate
situation’) and judgement, as Scholz asserts that the Ukrainian people
do not just protect their homeland, but also fight for
“Freiheit und ihre Demokratie, für Werte, die wir mit ihnen
teilen” (‘freedom and democracy, for values that we share with
them’), thus aligning them as democrats and Europeans. By supporting
them, “we” are “auf der richtigen Seite der Geschichte” (‘on
the right side of history’), an expression that harks back
to the personal war experience discourse and Germany’s past on
the wrong side of history. The shift in arms delivery
policy is thus cast as morally justified and historically necessary,
contrasted as it is to the evil of “Putins Aggression”
(‘Putin’s aggression’).
