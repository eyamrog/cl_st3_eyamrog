â€¦ many of them do not receive any salary in
cash, rewarding their services with the land they occupy; others,
according to the relationships and agreements of the rustic farms,
in the mountains, receive salaries that fluctuate from twenty to
fifty cents, and in warm regions, from eighty cents to
two and three sucres. (Moreno 1992:73)
