In some cases, legislators mix a regional approach, which is
highly dependent on mayors and municipal leaders, with thematic activity
or working with a specific sector. In the latter case,
interviewees tended to give less importance to regional activities as
well as to mayors as brokers. One of evidence from
this lesser importance comes from a legislator who is active
in defending a groupâ€™s interests: she does not keep a
regional office, and only has one paid assistant in her
hometown.
