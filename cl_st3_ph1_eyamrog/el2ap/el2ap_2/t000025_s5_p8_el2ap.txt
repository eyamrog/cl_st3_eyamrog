Topical opioids were another option. Opioid receptors are present in
the peripheral nervous system, synthesized in the dorsal root ganglia,
transported axonally to the peripheral terminals, and detectable after peripheral
injuries and inflammation. An inflammatory process developed in the MFW
beds could explain pain improvement using opioids (Vardhan et al.,
2019). Future studies should consider more potent opioids such as
fentanyl (Wang et al., 2017).
