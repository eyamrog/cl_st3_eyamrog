On the other hand, the second group, made up of
salaried workers and farmers, as well as the third group,
made up of public workers, merchants, exporters and agricultural owners,
did see their purchasing power affected during the Great Depression
in both trends previously described: a rise in purchasing power
until 1932, and then a steady decline until 1939. Wages
in 1937 are only comparable to 1928 wages, meaning purchasing
power did not grow for a decade. According to Feiker
(1931), Ecuador, with a population of around two million people,
had a low purchasing power, similar to that of a
Nordic country of two hundred thousand people.
