Whether the purpose of NATO expansion is seen as an
attempt to prevent the formation of a Eurasian alliance (KLARE,
2022), a “justifiable response to the […] entreaties of new
Central and Eastern European democracies” (SAROTTE, 2021) that contributed to
the frustration of East-West cooperation, or “the most fateful error
in the entire post-Cold War era” (KENNAN, 1997) always depends
on one’s standpoint; there is no “objective position”. It is
a central contention of Bakhtinian dialogism that we do not
only engage in talk about discourse, but with discourse, and
that a form of dialogical understanding always includes evaluation and
response Todorov (1984, p.16). In the continuously changing realm of
politics, any analyst not only observes political processes, but also
shapes them, so that “decision and standpoint are inseparably bound
up together” (MANNHEIM, 1936, p.152). Individual standpoints, also sometimes called
researcher bias, thus unavoidably permeate any type of analysis (DAVIS,
1990, p.16; GEE, 2011, p.9). It is with this perspective
in mind that I will proceed to outline the method
in the following section.
