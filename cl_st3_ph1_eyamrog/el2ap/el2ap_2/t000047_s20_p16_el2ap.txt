Four settings are operational in Oral-B ad. These are the
Oral-B Dental Institute office, the toilet, the home of Social
Actor 3, and her office. These domains have different layout
systems as well known in society. One also observes the
utilization of various color schemes such as blue, being the
traditional color of the advertised product; white, which positions Social
Actors 1 and 2 as being indexical professionals. The indexical
appearance gives the male actors the license to promote the
toothpaste through its qualities. The top dress of the female
actor is in cool but dull green. The mint of
Oral-Bâ€™s content is also in white. These colors are not
without symbolic functions. Consequently, the researcher could deduce that blue
connotes calmness, tranquility, and acceptance (Kandisky, 1977; Gage, 1993). White,
being the color of the teeth and other modes, specifies
purity, cleanliness, and unity beyond human negative criticisms (Zelansky &
Fisher, 2003). The green color of Social Actor 3 is
a probable representation of harmony, honesty and natural spring of
nature (Gage, 1999). Though red is a strong connection with
fire, the lexeme, New, represented in red, might pain a
different picture of excitement, courage, and passion (Heller, 2009). These
characteristics are augmenting the qualities of Oral-B so that viewers
could be motivated to patronize the product.
