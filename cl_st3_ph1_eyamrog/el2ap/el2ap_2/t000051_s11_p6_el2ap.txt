the living utterance, having taken meaning and shape at a
particular historical moment in a socially specific environment, cannot fail
to brush up against thousands of living dialogic threads, woven
by socio-ideological consciousness around the given object of an utterance;
it cannot fail to become an active participant in social
dialogue. (BAKHTIN, 1981, p.276)
