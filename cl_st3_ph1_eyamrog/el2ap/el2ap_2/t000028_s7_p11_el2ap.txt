Based on this classification, we consider: 1) a person with
“no visual impairment” as someone with mild vision loss or
near-normal vision, that is, perceiving light; 2) “moderate visual impairment”
as moderate low vision, still perceiving light; 3) “severe visual
impairment” as grave low vision, but perceiving a little of
light; and 4) “blindness” as profound to total visual impairment,
perceiving no or almost no light. Thus, it is possible
to say that blindness is one type of visual impairment,
which is the most severe one.
