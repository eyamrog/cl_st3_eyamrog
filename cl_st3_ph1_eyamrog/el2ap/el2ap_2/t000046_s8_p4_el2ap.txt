To this end, the adoption of an expanded concept of
health, present in the Brazilian scenario due to the VIII
National Health Conference (BRASIL, 1986), brought new perspectives. Based on
this concept, health began to be considered as a result
of people’s living conditions, with food, housing, income, environment, work,
transportation, employment, leisure, freedom, access and ownership of land and
access to health services as determinants. In Palma, Estevão and
Bagrichevsky’s (2003) understanding, it is an individual’s experimentation in his
relationship with society.
