In the category “Environment,” PE was noticed as responsible for
inputting a comprehensive conception of health in the students by
using common situations of daily living as opportunities for intervention.
Thus, it shows a PE not restricted to the individual,
since it seeks to investigate the relation between the individual
and the place of social insertion. However, Becalli and Gomes’
(2011) study alert to the existence of traces of a
hygienist view in the discipline. In our study, we could
note this view in teacher Daniela’s speech, when she mentions
hygiene, cleanliness and organization.
