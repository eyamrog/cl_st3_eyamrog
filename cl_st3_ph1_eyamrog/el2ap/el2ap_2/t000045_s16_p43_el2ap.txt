close to 20, with a minority (1 to 4) working
at the regional office. In one case, almost half of
the staff (9) worked in the region and would become

"mitigating the absence of the legislator in the region", "bringing
to us the reality of a citizen", being "our voices
and ears in the region" (Chief of Staff 4).
