Players were divided into four groups, each referring to their
field position: Goalkeepers (n=2), Defenders (n=7), Midfielders (n=7) and Forwards
(n=2). The presence values of each PMSL factor, as proposed
by Engelmann (1986), were calculated multiplying the value assigned by
the participant on the scale at the side of each
locution by its value of correlation (charge) with each factor.
To permit comparisons envolving factors with diferent number of correlated
locutions a standardization was done to put each value of
presence of each PMSL factor in a 0-1 scale. This
standardization was done this way: In each PMSL factor, the
maximum possible value was calculated by multiplying all its positive
charges by 5 (maximum value of the PMSL scale at
the side of the locution) and its negative charges by
1 (minimum value of the LEAP scale at the side
of the locution) and the mean of the values obtained
was calculated. For the minimum value the opposite was done:
the positive charges were multiplied by 1 and the negative
ones multiplied by 5 and the mean of the obtained
values was calculated. From there, the minimum value obtained was
adjusted to 0 (zero) and the maximum value was adjusted
as well, corresponding to the scale proportion (for instance, if
a minimum value was adjusted from 2 to 0, the
maximum value was deducted by 2 as well). To the
maximum value adjustment to 1 (one), it was divided by
itself. Thus, the presence value obtained in the original scale
(1 to 5) was also divided by the maximum value
adjusted, having the value of presence of the PMSL factor.
This scale standardization procedure was done for all presence values
of all participants at all events. The mean values of
presence of each PMSL factor were considered for statistical analysis.
