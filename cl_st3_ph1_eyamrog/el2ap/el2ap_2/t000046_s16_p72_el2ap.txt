Thus, actions such as the School Health Program (PSE )
(BRASIL, 2007), in addition to allowing pedagogical actions directed to
health, according to Oliveira, Martins and Bracht (2015b), enable network
actions, ensuring a greater scope of identification and treatment of
risk behaviors. In this sense, Carneiro and Coutinho (2015) point
to a significant identification and referral of students by the
school for treatment in a mental health unit, thus demonstrating
a concern about studentsâ€™ mental health. This is a promising
intersectorial action.
