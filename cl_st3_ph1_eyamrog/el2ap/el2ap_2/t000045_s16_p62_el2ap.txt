It is, therefore, necessary to distinguish between the dynamics of
mediation in the election period and the period between elections.
Much of the studies on brokers (Szwarcberg, 2012; Munoz, 2014;
Aspinall, 2014; Gingerich, 2020) focus on the electoral moment and
generalize their findings to the entire term of office. Thus,
they tend to overestimate elements present in the election period
and neglect dynamics that extend beyond that moment. The assumption
that politicians orient their actions toward electoral success is reasonable,
but this does not mean that all brokerage dynamics are
reducible to the logic of campaigns or that they cannot
assume different political meanings.
