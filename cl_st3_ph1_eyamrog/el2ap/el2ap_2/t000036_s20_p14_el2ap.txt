In the third group, constructed from the economically active population
found in the public sector, workers in industries and merchants,
the data from Naranjo (2017) showed that the lowest-paid employees
and workers had, on average, an income of 91 sucres
per month within 1920s. However, these wages had fallen sharply
during the international crisis: the Great Depression reduced unskilled wages
by about 25 sucres from 1929 to 1935. As expected,
this group, which is directly involved with the local market
and with national transactions and trade, they received a higher
remuneration than the other groups.
