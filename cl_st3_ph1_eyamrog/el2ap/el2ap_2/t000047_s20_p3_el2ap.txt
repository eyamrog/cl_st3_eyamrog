Thereafter, a social actor (labeled as Social Actor 1), wearing
a deep blue tie on a light blue long sleeve
shirt, comments in the toilet that: You clean your teeth
every morning. This declarative clause, shown in 1a, is assertive
in pronunciation, acknowledging that people usually wash their teeth daily.
The deployment of You (subject) in the clause is generic
because the pronoun refers to all viewers of the ad,
making You an object of exclusivity. Then the target audience
of Oral-B is everyone who uses toothpaste. The adjunct, every
morning, indicates that taking care of the teeth is a
daily ritual done in the morning before breakfast consumption or
going out for oneâ€™s daily routines. Social Actor 1 accompanies
You clean your teeth every morning with gestural activities of
the hands and head. Social Actor 1 folds his ten
fingers as a boxer preparing to fight. He moves the
hands from the resting positions up a bit to the
chest. Holding a toothbrush in his right hand, as the
individual makes a sagittal movement of the head, using the
right hand to emphasize the point, You clean your teeth
every morning. The spoken modes and the gestural actions are
demonstrative affordances of conviction.
