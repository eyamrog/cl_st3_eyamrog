Can the gestures we perform aid the teaching and learning
process? The present paper summarizes the state of the art
on the subject within the field of education, with a
specific eye on gestural communication. Research has been found at
virtually all levels of education regarding the use of gestures
as a way to assist students in learning a second
language, inclusive education, and science and math education. In general,
there is solid evidence supporting that gestural communication helps in
the evaluation and introduction of a new word in the
teaching of a second language; as an additional resource for
teachers and students with disabilities and as a tool to
contribute to the teaching of concepts considered abstract and complex
in the field of science and mathematics teaching. Of interest
is the strong evidence that gesture constitutes a hidden yet
powerful channel to exchange information, learn, and even as a
tool to help reason.
