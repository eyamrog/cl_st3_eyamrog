Except for one, all interviewees affirmed that the mayor’s support
was important in the legislator’s last election. For most of
them, mayors’ importance as brokers stems from their visibility in
the municipality, their political power, and their capacity to execute
(as opposed to councilors, for example). To a large extent,
mayors perform the role of gatekeepers, and their endorsement is
important, sometimes necessary, for representatives to enter the municipalities, a
finding that converges with those of Bezerra (1999) in his
investigation on national representatives.
