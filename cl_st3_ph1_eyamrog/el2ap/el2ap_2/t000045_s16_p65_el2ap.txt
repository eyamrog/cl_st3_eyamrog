Indeed, mayors and councilors play an important informational role for
state legislators. Our interviews suggest that representatives allocate resources based
on demands from municipalities and that they consult with mayors
and councilors in different negotiations around budget amendments. Legislators rely
on brokers to know which benefits will be valued by
the local population, and adjust the available resources to this
information. Without brokersâ€™ support, legislators would face more obstacles in
representing their constituents and influencing public policies.
