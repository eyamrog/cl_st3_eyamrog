The Russian invasion of Ukraine can be seen as the
tragic culmination of a crisis that has been unfolding at
least since the Maidan protests in 2014, where democratic protest
against electoral fraud ultimately became dominated by far right groups
(ISHCHENKO, 2016) and was “inextricably bound up with geopolitical contestation”,
as US politicians hurried to Ukraine to voice “US support
for Ukraine’s NATO and Euro-Atlantic aspirations” (SAKWA, 2016, p.52–53). The
view that “Ukraine’s existence transforms Russian power by reducing it
significantly” (BRZEZINSKI, 1996, p.4) has informed US geopolitical strategy and
shows the wider importance the current conflict has for European
and even global peace (GARDNER, 2016). The Paris Charter of
1990, which was based on the Helsinki Final Act and
marked the end of the Cold War, presented an opportunity
for lasting peace and unity in Europe but was unsuccessful,
largely because the signatory states’ distinct cultures and traditions of
security did not approximate each other as agreed in the
Charter (MEYER, VON BREDOW & EVERS, 2015). The EU, mainly
driven by Swedish and Polish foreign ministers Carl Bildt and
Radek Sikorski, designed the Eastern Partnership to take in former
Soviet states other than Russia: “Instead of finding ways to
transcend the deepening lines of division in the continent”, Bildt
and Sikorski institutionalised them in order to “engineer Ukraine’s separation
from Russia”, which “rendered the EU as much of a
threat in Russian perceptions as NATO” (SAKWA, 2016, p.39–41). All
the implications cannot hope to be accurately and fairly represented
in an article, but a wealth of relevant literature exists
(D. JOHNSTONE, 2022; PETRO, 2017; POCH-DE- FELIU, 2003, p.357–374).
