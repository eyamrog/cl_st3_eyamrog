According to the interviewees, state representatives usually collaborate with national
representatives. Most of the time, these partnerships are with members
of different parties but from the same region. There seems
to be a division of labor that pays off for
all actors involved. While the national legislator can allocate greater
financial resources to municipalities through budget amendments, the state representative
has closer contacts with the region and voters, as reported
in the interviews. In one of the cases included in
our sample, there seemed to be almost a fusion between
the state legislator and her national partnerâ€™s office. In this
case, they were fellow party members.
