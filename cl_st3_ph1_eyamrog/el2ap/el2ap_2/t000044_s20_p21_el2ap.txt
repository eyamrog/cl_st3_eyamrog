Scherr (2008) goes beyond the other researches mentioned so far
on gestures in higher education. His research seeks evidence that
students' gesticulation can not only fill in gaps in students'
verbal expressions but offer valuable information about what is going
on in students' minds, that is, to better understand what
the student is thinking about Physics at that particular moment.
"Physics education is a rich field to further explore these
issues, and researchers in physics education can benefit and contribute
to ongoing investigations into the importance of gesture in thinking
and learning." (Scherr, 2008).
