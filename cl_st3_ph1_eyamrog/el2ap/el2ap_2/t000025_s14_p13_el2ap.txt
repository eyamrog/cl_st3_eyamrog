After conducting the searches, all identified records were grouped and
registered on Mendeleyâ“‡ (Mendeley Ltd., Elsevier, The Netherlands) for management
and duplicate removal. Two independent reviewers reviewed titles and abstracts
based on the inclusion criteria for evaluation. Potentially relevant documents
were retrieved in full text. Two independent reviewers evaluated the
full text of the selected citations in detail, based on
the inclusion criteria. A third reviewer decided on disagreements between
reviewers at any stage of the selection process.
