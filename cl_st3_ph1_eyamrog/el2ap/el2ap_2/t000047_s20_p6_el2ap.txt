Surprisingly, Social Actor 2 creates a sense of belonging for
Social Actor 1, giving and wearing a white lab-coat for
him, making two of them as being indexical (Dyer, 2005).
Perhaps, the donation and wearing of the lab-coat connote that
only dental experts could promote Oral-B in the way that
such marketing should be done. Social Actor 2 indirectly tells
Social Actor 1 that a layman cannot advertise Oral-B; and
that only dentists of repute from the Oral-B Institute have
the capacity to enlighten the target audience about the pedigree
of the toothpaste.
