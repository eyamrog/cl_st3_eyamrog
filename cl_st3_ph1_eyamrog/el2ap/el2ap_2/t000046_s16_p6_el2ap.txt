Data analysis was based on content analysis of the interviewees’
statements, considering the phases described in Campos (2004, p.614): pre-exploration,
which consists of apprehending the important aspects of the material
through exhaustive reading; selection of units of analysis through clippings
of sentences and/or transcription of paragraphs related to the objective
of the study, and; categorization, which are “[...] large statements
that cover a variable number of themes [...] that meet
the objectives of the study [...]”. We used the non-aprioristic
categorization, which is formed based on the contact of the
researchers with the analyzed material.
