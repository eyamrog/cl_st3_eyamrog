The choose of volunteers was mediated by the pedagogical coordinator
during the collective pedagogical planning. The professionals were approached individually
to not compromise the school activities. The school unit chosen
is located in the municipality of Santos/SP, where middle school
(6th to 9th year) was available. According to the last
Basic Education Census, elementary and middle school in Brazil covers
62.6% of registered teachers and the public System is the
most comprehensive, approximately 77% of Brazilian schools (BRASIL, 2020).
