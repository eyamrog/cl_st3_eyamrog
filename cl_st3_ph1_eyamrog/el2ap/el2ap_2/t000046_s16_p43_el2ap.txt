“It is all, not only in the area of how
they should come dressed for the PE, to ensure their
comfort, safety, avoiding injuries, but also the education of how
to maintain hygiene, cleanliness, organization; not only with their body,
but also in the environment in which they live, collaborating
with garbage, disposing paper correctly, their behavior. All this encompasses
health. I do not believe that it involves only the
physical state, the study of the human body; it encompasses
the education of the environment the student is inserted as
a whole” (Daniela – Art teacher).
