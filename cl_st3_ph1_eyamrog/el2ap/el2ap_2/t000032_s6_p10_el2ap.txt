In the present study, analysis of Present Mood States revealed
significant differences in the their presence values along the time
sequence of the competition, suggesting that investigation with an instrument
such as the PMSL, made in Brazil with Brazilian population,
may be more appropriate to investigate these aspects. PMSL contains
more positive and negative mood states than other instruments like
POMS, increasing the spectrum of possibilities of relationships with other
variables of the sport context linked to the changes in
Present Mood States of the athletes. The applicability of PMSL
to investigate Present Mood States is very quickly and was
compared to confirm the concordance level of other instruments as
PANAS (Pires et al., 2013). The results agreed with those
obtained with the PMSL by Bueno and Di Bonifácio (2007),
Dias-Silva (2013), Di Bonifácio (2013), Nogueira (2009), Silva (2013). The
presence of Factors III (Hope) and VII (Interest) and of
the locution “I am happy” (a locution negatively correlated with
Factor I - Humiliation/Anger, decreasing the presence value of this
Factor) reveals a common mood states among Soccer, Football, Volleyball
and Futsal athletes before the matches.
