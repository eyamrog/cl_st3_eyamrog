The Dentures in One Day technique proved feasible, advantageous and
effective for the rehabilitation of the edentulous indigenous peoples and
helped to overcome barriers that hinder access to the integrality
of indigenous oral health care, allowing improvement in the quality
of life of rehabilitated patients and resulting in a satisfactory
evaluation of the quality of dentures and chewing ability one
year after fitting.
