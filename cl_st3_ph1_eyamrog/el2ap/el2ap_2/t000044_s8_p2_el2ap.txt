According to Walkington, Chelule, Woods, and Nathan (2019), gestures play
a key role in mathematical reasoning, being an indicator that
mathematical understanding is embodied - inherently linked to action, perception,
and the physical body. As students collaborate and engage in
mathematical discussions, they use discourse practices such as explaining, refuting,
and developing each other's reasoning, often mixing speech and gesture
when talking.
