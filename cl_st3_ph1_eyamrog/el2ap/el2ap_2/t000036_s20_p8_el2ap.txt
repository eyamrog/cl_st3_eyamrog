The indigenous were the essential mass of the peasantry, as
an active part at the hacienda. After the indigenous were
the day laborers, small owners and artisans. Then, the mestizos:
merchants, carriers, employees, urban artisans. And finally, there are the
whites of the city. In 1930, Indians were no longer
considered the same way than in 1875. With a certain
level of democratization of society, “a State more coherent national,
international ideological movements and the birth of indigenism, the Ecuadorian
Indian ceases to be a simple illiterate labor force” (Saint-Geours
1994: 168).
