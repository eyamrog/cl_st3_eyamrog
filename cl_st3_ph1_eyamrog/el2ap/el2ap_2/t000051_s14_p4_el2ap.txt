The second step analyses how the identified discourses are brought
into competition, as centred and marginalised. For this, I will
draw on resources of engagement, which are ways “to construe
for the text a heteroglossic backdrop of prior utterances, alternative
viewpoints and anticipated responses” (MARTIN & WHITE, 2005, p.97). Those
are either dialogically expansive or contractive, as discussed in Section
3. Dialogically contractive resources of engagement are disclaim (deny, counter)
and proclaim (concur, pronounce, endorse); dialogically expansive resources are entertain
and attribute (acknowledge, distance) (MARTIN & WHITE, 2005, p.134). For
more detail on these resources, see Martin & White (2005,
p.97–98).
