On June 6, the Supreme Court, successfully compelled the government
to publish more precise figures on the incidence of coronavirus
infections, hospitalizations and fatalities. However, under-reporting remained a constant problem
because testing rates were extremely low. Bolsonaro’s power to cover
up for deaths was even more successful in the Amazon
region, despite–and legally in contempt of–the Supreme Court’s order to
protect over 300 indigenous communities (about 900,000 people). His prior
dismantling of environmental legislation had facilitated the plundering of indigenous
lands, and now allowed farmers, land leasers and miners to
bring coronavirus to indigenous populations.19 This was part of a
racist attitude of members of the government that considered natives
of the Amazon an obstacle to capitalist development. However, from
March 2020 on, indigenous people in the Amazon isolated themselves
so as to alleviate their coronavirus mortality-rate, which was 32%
higher than the that of the general population.20
