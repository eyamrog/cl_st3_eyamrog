In addition to difficulties in assessing broker performance, actors cannot
always produce the results expected by their allies. The interviewees
believe that, on many occasions, local brokers underperform for reasons
beyond their control, such as reorganization of forces in local
politics, party decisions that impact alternatives at their disposal, and
alternation of power caused by state and municipal elections. Thus,
they seem more inclined to acknowledge the positive role of
local allies than to blame them for bad results. In
other words, as opposed to what theory assumes, the principal
is not always able to adequately punish (or make credible
threats) to force commitment.
