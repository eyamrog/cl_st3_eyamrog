This is the first version of the proposed quality assessment
tool for SCCS and SCRI. It has been used in
five studies: one master’s degree dissertation, one published article, two
projects of a scientific initiation program (not published), one thesis
and one article submitted for publication (20–23). It is based
on the NOC that has never been published in a
journal, thus has not undergone peer review. On the other
hand, it is worth noting that the instrument was elaborated
via Delphi method, has been tested in many systematic reviews
and has been modified over this process (25) . Besides
the critics the NOS receives, it has been used to
evaluate innumerous studies included in published systematic reviews, thus confirming
it’s validity and applicability.
