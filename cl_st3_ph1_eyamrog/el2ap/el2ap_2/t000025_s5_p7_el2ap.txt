The use of a non-adherent and absorbent polyurethane foam covered
with Ibuprofen was mentioned in 11% of the studies with
positive results regarding MFW pain control. This was not surprising
since this drug introduces anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties into the
wound bed. However, new studies with the primary objective of
evaluating this therapy to control MFW- related pain with an
adequate description of the methodology would allow for a safer
indication, considering its additional properties of nonadherence and absorbency (Gottrup
et al., 2008).
