“Health is a set of things. But for the young
people, mainly, move them away a little from the cell
phone, headset and bring them closer to sports, in which
they are doing an exercise that can rid them of
illness, including the mental part of it, the perception of
health. Health encompasses sane mint and healthy body” (Nara –
Portuguese language teacher).
