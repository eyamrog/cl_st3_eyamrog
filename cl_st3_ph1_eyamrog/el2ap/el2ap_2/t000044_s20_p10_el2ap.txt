In 2012, Garcia and Infante published an article in which
they addressed the impact that gestures can have on the
mathematical environment in workshops given in higher education. After the
workshops, the researchers realized that there was a correlation between
diagramming and gestures (dynamic and static). These two types of
gestures were part of the students' constructive thinking, relating them
to the problem or the construction of their diagrams. The
more challenging the problems, the more students gesticulate. Some issues
were influenced by gestures by their colleagues and over time
they were adopted and adapted.
