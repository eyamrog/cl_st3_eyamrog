In the northern central Sierra, which includes the provinces of
Chimborazo, Tungurahua, Cotopaxi, Pichincha and Imbabura, the hacienda system was
the base on textile and agricultural production becoming the main
source of income for workers, and the main source of
industrial development. Creamer (2018) argues that in the 1920s, a
textile boom developed which founded the bases for the type
of industry that was going to grow in the region,
the main representative cases are the Haciendas in Otavalo and
the Valley of Los Chillos (Saint-Geours 1994).
