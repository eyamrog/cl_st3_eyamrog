Ten (14.2%) studies used absorbent dressings to manage MFW-related pain.
The studies included non-systematic reviews (50%), case studies (20%), a
guideline (10%), randomized clinical trials (10%), and a survey (10%).
None (90%) of the studies aimed to test the absorbent
dressing to control MFW-related pain. Some studies only cite them
as a dressing option for patients with pain related to
high exudate absorption, minimizing the possible dermatitis related-pain derived from
periwound moisture. In all studies, these dressings are associated with
other therapies such as opioids, anesthetics, and antiseptics. No study
mentions a standardized way of using the dressings or of
displaying their results on pain management without being combined with
other products.
