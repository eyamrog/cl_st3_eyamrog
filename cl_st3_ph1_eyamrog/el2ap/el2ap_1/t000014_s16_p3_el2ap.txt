The Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi is a research institute associated
with the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI). Located
in Belém, in the state of Pará, the Goeldi focuses
on research on the Amazon. Its Linguistics Area, part of
the Human Sciences Division, has had a precarious history. In
1986, the Area had no recorder, no computer and only
a few books. As is often the case in the
country, there was little investment in infrastructure. However, there was
a respected tradition of scientific collections at the Goeldi, and
language documentation fit well into that tradition. Interns, fellows and
visiting researchers fostered increasing levels of activity within the Linguistics
Area, including documentation.
