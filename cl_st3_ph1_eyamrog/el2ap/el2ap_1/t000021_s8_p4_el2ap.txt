Emotional labor can be understood as a form of emotion
regulation in response to emotional demands to achieve work outcomes
(GRANDEY, 2000; MALLORY; RUPP, 2016). In her integrative model of
emotional labor, Grandey (2000) claimed that events and emotion rules
from the work environment activate and guide workers' emotional regulation,
influencing the selection and the implementation of strategies. Emotion regulation
is a process that involves the modulation of different dimensions
of the emotional episode, such as its context of occurrence,
intensity, valence, frequency, and expression. It encompasses physiological, behavioral, and
cognitive processes (ALDAO, 2013; GROSS, 2015) and can start automatically
or deliberately when emotions are perceived as dysfunctional in a
given situation (GROSS, 2015).
