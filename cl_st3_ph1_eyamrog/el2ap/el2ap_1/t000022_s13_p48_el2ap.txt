This look at collaboration within Brazil in recent years has
highlighted the fact that low international collaboration in co-authored publications
of a country does not imply institutional inbreeding or parochialism.
Collaboration between authors from different states is a characteristic feature
of the Brazilian scientific production space as analyzed through the
SciELO documents of the last five years, that is, the
period 2016-2020. This is a question of a practice of
collaboration between teams located in clearly different spaces/environments, with a
diverse academic history and processes of institutionalization that affect, in
particular, some disciplinary areas since, as might be expected, inter-state
collaboration is less prevalent among those disciplinary areas that tend
to have fewer authors in their articles.
