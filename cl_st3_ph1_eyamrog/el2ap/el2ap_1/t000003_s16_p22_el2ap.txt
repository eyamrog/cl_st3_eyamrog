We provide an account of three different aspects of the
activities that were developing around football when we were conducting
fieldwork in June 2015, and we introduce some of the
key social actors involved. The first aspect is that of
the naming and branding7 of the clubs. Here, we focus
on the ways in which the linguistic and semiotic practices
involved in the naming and branding indexed different Timorese identities.
The second aspect is that of the leadership of the
clubs and the organisational practices of the club managers8. Here,
we focus on the ways in which the managers, and
club organisers, were able to draw on the language resources
and funds of knowledge available to them in their organisational
activities. We also point to the ways in which Timorese
cultural practices were incorporated into the ethos of some of
the clubs. The third aspect is that of the scheduling
of football tournaments (around key dates in the history of
the establishment of the nation of Timor-Leste). Here, we also
draw attention to the friendly away matches and the use
of Facebook and YouTube in the representation of all the
football matches (in the tournaments and the friendly matches).
