In the absence of data that could illustrate inter-institutional collaboration,
the analysis of inter-state collaboration in the case of Brazil
introduces a significant nuance in the interpretation of the forms
of collaboration that appear in Figure 6. There we mention
that 79.6% of the articles in the OLIVA database with
authors from Brazil are only by authors from Brazil, and
that other countries show lower percentages of publication with authors
only from within their own country, such as Argentina (48.3%),
Chile (52.7%) and Mexico (56.5%). The documents that we analyze
in this section (SciELO 2016-2020) show that, when there is
participation of authors from Brazil, in 41% of the cases
there is collaboration, either by authors from two states (31.9%)
or from three or more states (9.1%). The remaining 59%
(only within-state collaboration) is presented as a proportion similar to
that of exclusively within-country collaboration in the Spanish-speaking countries mentioned.
