From this last idea, a result of Fernández-Hernández et al.
(2022) emerges, which showed that parents who participate little in
recreational and sports activities with their children have a negative
effect on the development of executive functions in their children.
The question is, do parents from Cienfuegos and Espiritu play
with their children frequently? What kind of games do they
use? These are interesting questions that could justify part of
the results of the study. In this sense, these questions
could open the doors to new propositions for future lines
of scientific research on preschool children.
