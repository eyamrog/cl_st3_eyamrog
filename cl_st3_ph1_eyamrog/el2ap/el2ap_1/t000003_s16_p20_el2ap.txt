As we have shown above, the Timorese migrants in Dungannon
and Cookstown have faced considerable social, economic and linguistic challenges
in securing housing and employment as they have built their
new lives there. At the same time, within their local
life worlds, they are actively creating spaces for solidarity and
conviviality. Focusing on the ways in which Timorese men and
women were mooring (or in some case re-mooring) in these
small Northern Irish towns gave us a keen sense of
their agency in building new lives, in new spaces, despite
the challenges facing them.
