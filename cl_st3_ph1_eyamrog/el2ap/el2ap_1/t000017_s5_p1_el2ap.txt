The present study examined the content validity, internal structure validity,
and internal consistency reliability of the B-PREA-R, an instrument that
was designed to assess the cognitive development of preschool children
in the cultural context of Cuba and to be applied
by educators. The content validity of the B-PREA-R improved compared
to the previous version (Ramirez, et al., 2018). The B-PREA
had 110 items where 28% had low discrimination, while the
revised version finally remained with nine subtests, 199 items, 193
items with high and good quality, and six with regular
quality. In the previous version, it was recommended to improve
the performance of the vocabulary, syllable rhymes, matrices and comparing
quantities subtests; however, in the B-PREA-R, the matrices subtest was
improved with 15 items of good discrimination, the counting quantities
subtest with all its items of good quality, the syllable
rhyming subtest was eliminated and the syllable repeating subtest was
elaborated with 16 items of good quality and four of
fair quality, and finally, the vocabulary subtest was improved with
18 items of good quality and two items of fair
quality.
