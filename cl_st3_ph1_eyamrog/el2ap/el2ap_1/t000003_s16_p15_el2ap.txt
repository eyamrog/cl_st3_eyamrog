However, those who indicated that they had experienced this early
hostility also noted that there had been change over time
as other groups of migrants had also arrived, from Poland,
Portugal and the Baltic States (Interview with RS and HA,
June 2015). A local nongovernmental organisation had also made a
difference: The South Tyrone Empowerment Project (STEP) had been established
to provide assistance to local groups of migrant origin, in
finding appropriate housing, in dealing with local authorities and with
legal issues and with interpreting and translation in bureaucratic encounters
and in health care settings. During our field visits, there
were some visible signs of a change of ethos in
the public domain, at least. There were also books for
children in different languages in the public library and a
multicultural festival had been organised by Dungannon Town Council.
