It was in October 2014 that we learned that there
were nine Timorese football teams for men and boys in
the Dungannon/Cookstown area. They are listed in Table 2 below.
The names of the clubs indexed the identity of the
players in different ways. Different language resources (including Portuguese) were
drawn upon. The players in FC Tahi Calu and FC
Moko United were mostly Fataluku speakers, from Lospalos, in the
Eastern region of Timor-Leste. The names of their clubs signified
a regional identity. Similarly, the regional identity of the players
in FC Matebian was indexed in the name of their
club: They were mostly from the Baucau area, and from
the eastern and central regions, and most of the players
spoke Makasai.
