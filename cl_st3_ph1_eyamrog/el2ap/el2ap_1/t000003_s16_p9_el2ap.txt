Some of our interviewees had spent some time in Portugal
before moving to Northern Ireland and re-mooring there. They thus
had a working knowledge of Portuguese. For example, one interviewee
had been one of the students who had sought refuge
in an embassy in Jakarta in the 1990s. He had
subsequently been given safe passage to Portugal (Interview with HA,
June 2015).
