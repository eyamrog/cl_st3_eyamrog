While all these options are great for sharing data, none
of these systems is committed to the long-term digital preservation
of files or data. While they all might offer some
form of content backup, they do not promise long-term preservation.
The terms of use of these platforms include their right
to discontinue service and delete accounts and their contents. Moreover,
some platforms, such as YouTube, retain copies of materials even
when files are deleted by their owners/posters, or may be
subject to automated downloads by other websites â€“ an obvious
problem where sensitive data are concerned (RICE, 2021).
