A simple linear regression analysis was performed using the values
of the neuropsychological tests in the two provinces of the
country. Neuropsychological variables were used as predictors (independent variable) and
the dependent variables were the values of intellectual performance evaluated
with the Raven (nonverbal) for preschoolers. A radial graph was
used for the presentation of the results with the purpose
of representing the neuropsychological profiles based on the weaknesses and
strengths between both provinces of the country. In all cases
when the significance of the test was less than 0.05,
then we say that significant differences exist.
