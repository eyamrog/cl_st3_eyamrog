While the game is taking place, its pace follows and
is at all times regulated by the rhythm of the
music produced by the orchestra. The role of the people
sitting or standing at the edge of the roda is
to maintain the energy by singing the chorus and clapping
hands. In one session we observed the mestre berating the
people around for not being energetic enough in their singing
and clapping.
