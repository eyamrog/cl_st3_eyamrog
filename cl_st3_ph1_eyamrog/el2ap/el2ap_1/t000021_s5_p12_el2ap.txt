There is evidence that suppression would be the strategy most
used by teachers (e.g., TAXER; GROSS, 2018). In the present
study, it was the most frequent reactive strategy and generally
used to avoid or resolve interpersonal conflicts. These findings suggest
the relevance of suppression in teaching, thus strengthening evidence that
suppression is not necessarily harmful in this context and can
be useful in the short term (ENGLISH et al., 2017).
This might help explain its high frequency. However, it should
be considered that the literature emphasizes the maladaptive character of
suppression, a priori because it has been associated with burnout
(e.g., CHANG, 2013; YIN, 2016). In addition, suppression can hinder
interpersonal closeness (GROSS, 2014), which is a vital component of
the quality of the teacher-student relationship (TAXER; FRENZEL, 2015). Finally,
in line with the findings by Akbari et al. (2017)
and Sutton (2004), the most mentioned suppression tactics in this
study were: masking (hiding genuine emotion and showing another), expressive
neutrality, being silent, and leaving the room for a while.
