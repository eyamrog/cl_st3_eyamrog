Another important fact regarding the human resources that would make
the pedagogical use of DICT feasible, is the regular presence
of a multidisciplinary team, composed of at least, a computer
technician and a pedagogical facilitator. The former of these professionals
was a reality from 2006 to 2013 in the State
of Goi√°s and it varied across Brazil. In essence, their
role was to assist teachers in computer labs, mainly with
the pedagogical aspect of ICT integration and disciplinary knowledge (Bueno,
2017; Brito, 2008). In most schools, the facilitator was a
teacher, and could be from any area. It was a
multitasking profile, but in some municipalities, he may have been
a computer technician. The variety of functions exercised by this
individual meant that a focus on the pedagogical function was
not always possible, which was further impaired when the professional
did not have a teaching background.
