The chamada is another move which is performed in a
synchronized way through the coordination of two players’ bodies. Literally
‘a call’, it is a strategic, ritualistic sub-game, in which
one of the players ‘calls’ the other one through the
gesture of raising their hands. The other player joins them
and they walk forwards and backwards in a close distance
– which is the source of a potential danger. Although
chamada can appear as a friendly break in the game,
its purpose is to test the opponent’s alertness, and either
of the players may try to take their opponent down.
