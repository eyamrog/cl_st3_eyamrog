On the one hand, it was found that teachers use
strategies that seem to mitigate negative emotional responses in advance,
for example, by ignoring events such as minor behavioral infractions
(TAXER; GROSS, 2018; YIN, 2016) or savoring pleasant circumstances (in
directing attention to motivated students and academic progress, for example)
(TAXER; GROSS, 2018). However, the avoidance provided by these strategies
seems to hamper the resolution of routine, emotional events, pointing
out long-term costs, according to Sheppes (2014). On the other
hand, strategies such as excessive worry, rumination, and fault identification
seem to harm the affective state by anticipating, increasing, and
prolonging the unpleasant emotional experience. This can lead to emotional
and physical exhaustion, as Nelis et al. (2011) noted. In
this sense, these latter strategies are counterproductive to teaching. They
seem to direct individual resources to a negative experience and
not to the resolution of concrete and recurring problems in
the classroom, thus reducing the adaptive and functional potential of
regulation.
