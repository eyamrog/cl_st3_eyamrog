In the case of executive functions or functions related to
frontal lobe development, Ardila et al. (1995) have shown that
one factor that may influence the differences between groups is
the socioeconomic status of the parents. However, some studies indicate
that it has no effect on Cuban child development (Jiménez-Colín,
et al., 2018), although others indicate the opposite (Mora &
Anangonó, 2016).
