Such method allowed us to frame a general pattern of
the small-group talk that emerged in a Brazilian primary school,
as well as to search for differences across time. This
last procedure was done by measuring the relative frequencies of
the occurrence of codes. Thus, the findings represented here have
illustrated the positive aspects highlighted above. The great loss in
this analysis is the temporal development of meanings and the
ambiguity because utterances can have more than one functions. In
some cases, coding is said to be atheoretical or dogmatic
in their conclusions (Hennessy et al., 2020).
