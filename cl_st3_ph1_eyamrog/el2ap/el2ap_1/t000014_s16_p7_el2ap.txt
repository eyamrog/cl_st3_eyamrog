Currently, recordings in digital form are stored on a 32TB
Network Attached Storage (NAS). For security, in case of failure
of one of the NAS hard drives, RAID-6 redundancy is
implemented, reducing the storage capacity to 22TB. The contents of
that NAS are copied to the new 96TB NAS, whose
capacity is reduced to 72TB in light of redundancy (see
Figure 4). To ensure their safety, in case of risks
such as fire or lightning, the two NAS must be
kept in different buildings. Audio recordings are saved in their
original format, i.e. as .wav files. Video recordings are saved
in their highest definition format and also in compressed (.mpg)
format, which takes up much less space. These compressed files
and audio files are cataloged and stored using Language Archiving
Technology (LAT) software. Most of them are copied on the
server of the Information and Communication Technology Sector of the
Goeldi Museum.
