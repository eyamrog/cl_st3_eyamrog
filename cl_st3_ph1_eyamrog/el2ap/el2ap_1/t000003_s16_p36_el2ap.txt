Despite this diversity in the team-specific practices of identification, the
annual scheduling of the tournaments around dates of national significance
in Timor-Leste foregrounded the shared national identity of the players.
The tournaments brought all the clubs together in sports events
so that, in this Irish context, they were seen as
part of one diasporic community, with its origins in the
nation of Timor-Leste. Of particular significance too is that fact,
mentioned above, that details of these tournaments were regularly posted
on Facebook and YouTube and viewed by people in Timor-Leste
and across the diaspora. These regular postings were part of
wider digital practices and intense uses of mobile technology across
the transnationally connected Timorese diaspora. One further insight that we
have gleaned thus far is that the particular migration trajectories,
communicative repertoires and funds of knowledge of some Timorese in
this setting in Northern Ireland have positioned them in ways
that enable them to take a lead in setting up
group activities of a distinctive nature, whether it be a
football club with a particular ethos, or cultural groups (such
as the choir mentioned earlier) that are oriented to particular
aspects of Timorese cultural heritage. So, for some, there is
considerable scope for exercising individual agency, at least within local
life worlds â€“ scope for creating spaces of solidarity and
conviviality, through organisational practices that involve complex and situated uses
of linguistic and semiotic resources. At the same time, through
these processes of mooring in the new country, a strong
sense of shared history and belonging, tied to the nation
of origin, is also emerging.
