Cleaning interactions among birds and mammals exhibit a great diversity
of species and contexts. Analyzing two different networks, of different
sizes and different locations, we could identify patterns in a
facultative interaction from a broader perspective. Species with a wide
repertoire of consumption could potentially engage in different types of
interactions, such as facultative interactions like cleaning symbiosis. Once the
bird is exposed to an opportunity, here defined as the
presence of a mammal that hosts food resources, the ability
to use this opportunity is defined by the species natural
history. Our results suggest that for the majority of cleaners,
the ability to consume different types of resources is an
important feature to engage in cleaning interactions. Because the diversity
of consumption is important for engaging in the interactions, a
structural pattern such as centrality degree could also be influenced
by the diversity of consumption. The purpose of this analysis
is to understand the implications of resource consumption in the
community. The network centrality degree analysis shows that there is
no relation between the centrality degree and the diet diversity
index of bird species. Which means that the ability of
consuming different types of resources do not influence the centrality
of the species in the network.
