A literature review was carried out to meet the objective
of the study. The selection of the articles was made
considering three criteria: the topic, child assessment in preschool infancy;
an equation to select the articles in the different database,
"assessment AND preschool AND neuropsychology", "assessment AND preschool AND Luria",
"preschool AND neuropsychology" "preschool AND Luria"; years and languages of
publication, from 2015 to 2022, in Spanish and English; type
of database, coming from eight databases, SCOPUS, WOS, SCIELO, PUBMED,
DIALNET, LATINDEX, SCIENCEGATE, EBSCO. In addition, the selection considered two
actions to refine the search, first, check directly in the
Luria Journal for being a Russian journal that is not
registered in any of the mentioned databases, and second action,
perform an advanced search in the academic google to include
journals indexed in SCOPUS and WOS, because the authors do
not have funding to access directly to these databases. Finally,
36 articles were selected (see Table 1).
