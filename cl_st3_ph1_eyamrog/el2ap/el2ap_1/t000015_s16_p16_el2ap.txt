A quarter century after the Cetto and Alonso-Gamboa study, the
Web of Science Citation Reports includes 1.2% of the JUOJS
(Table 3).15 The coverage of JUOJS in EBSCO and Scopus
is only marginally better. Our concern here is with the
extent to which these three databases are commonly assumed to
constitute the scientific literature, with researchers turning to them to
write literature reviews and analyze characteristics of scholarly communication, for
example, in the Global South (e.g., Cort√©s, Guix & Carbonell,
2021).
