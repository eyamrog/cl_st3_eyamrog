This section offers a pair of case studies illustrating language
documentation and archiving in Brazil, through projects carried out in
collaboration with the Paresi-Haliti and Enawene Nawe peoples and led
by Ana Paula Brandão. After a brief introduction to these
two languages, we describe the documentation projects (§6.1), and the
resulting archival collections (§6.2).
