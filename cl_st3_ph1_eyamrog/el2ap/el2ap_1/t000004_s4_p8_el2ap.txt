We started this study with a relatively simple question: how
could capoeira in diaspora provide a context for Portuguese learning,
in particular an Afro-Brazilian variety of Portuguese. The idea of
translanguaging led us to examine the complex interaction of language
and embodied action and eventually music in capoeira practice. It
began to seem reductionist simply to see capoeira as an
occasion for Portuguese learning. For that reason we began to
see the capoeira practice as a register, assembled from the
variety of semiotic modes in play including from different language
varieties and from that point capoeira learning and language learning
as a part of it as a form of enregisterment.
Another question we asked ourselves was whether the Portuguese learnt
in capoeira would be sufficient to learn Portuguese. For some
of the capoeiristas we spoke to, capoeira was a jumping
off point towards fluency in Portuguese. For others this was
not the case. Nevertheless we see potential for engagement with
capoeira to deepen Portuguese learning more generally. Probably in language
learning terms, a combination of exposure to Portuguese through capoeira
with other ways of learning would be most effective. We
started this investigation with concepts like informal learning and language
learning in the wild. Again our investigation showed that capoeira
is multi-layered and complexly organized. Nevertheless we would suggest that
in the typical diasporic capoeira group, Portuguese language learning remains
informal and incidental, that the contramestres donâ€™t see themselves as
language teachers. We might however conclude by suggesting that the
idea of language learning as enregisterment is an interesting one
that could be extended more widely to more mainstream ways
of language learning.
