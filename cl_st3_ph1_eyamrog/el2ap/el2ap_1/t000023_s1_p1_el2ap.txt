(Periphytic algal flora of the low Doce river, Espírito Santo
State, Brazil, after ore tailings flow, 1: smooth cell walled
Cosmarium Corda (Zygnematophyceae, Desmidiaceae). Study aimed at identifying and recording
smooth or finely punctate cell walled Cosmarium Corda species of
the low Doce river region, Espírito Santo State, Brazil. Periphytic
material was collected monthly during the period October 2018 to
February 2020, except for October 2019. We identified 22 taxa
and analyzed the environmental conditions (trophic state, pH and total
iron) in which each taxon occurred. Our study recorded 21
new records of smooth cell walled Cosmarium for Espírito Santo
State and one (Cosmarium trilobulatum var. tumidum Willi Krieger &
Gerloff) for Brazil.
