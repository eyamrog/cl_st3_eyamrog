Although not previously described for liana species, our results highlight
that dehydration significantly affects biomechanical properties of stems and leaves
of the widespread liana Amphilophium curcigerum (L.) L.G.Lohmann (Bignoniaceae), increasing
the bending stiffness and fracture toughness, respectively. The increase of
bending stiffness makes the stems of lianas more prone to
rupture, limiting flexion and torsion capacity. Moreover, keeping samples moist
after fieldwork allows a proper estimation of biomechanical properties, as
discussed below.
