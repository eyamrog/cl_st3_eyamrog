To ensure the reliability of data analysis, the encodings were
compared and examined repeatedly until the information was reliable and
unchanged. Then, content validity was used. Finally, another researcher, a
Ph.D. in emotional regulation, analyzed the corpus validating the codes
and categorization until a consensus was reached. This process resulted
in 97.2% consistency among the researchers.
