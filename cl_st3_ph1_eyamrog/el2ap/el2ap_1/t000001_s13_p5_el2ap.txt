ONT library preparation, chemistry and basecalling are also important factors.
Both ligation-based and rapid preparations are appropriate for bacterial whole-genome
sequencing, though ligation-based preparations can favour sequencing yield while rapid
preparations can favour read length13. ONT currently offers MinION/GridION flow
cells with two different pores: R9.4.1 (released in 2017) and
R10.4.1 (released in 2022). The pores used in R10.4.1 flow
cells are longer, improving homopolymer resolution and consensus accuracy, making
them the better choice for assembly14. Basecalling, the computational process
of translating the sequencer’s raw signals into nucleotide sequences, is
under constant development, so users should opt for the most
recent version of ONT’s recommended basecaller and use its highest-accuracy
model. If users do not have an ONT sequencer with
a GPU (e.g. a GridION), then access to a computer
with a GPU will be required to perform basecalling.
