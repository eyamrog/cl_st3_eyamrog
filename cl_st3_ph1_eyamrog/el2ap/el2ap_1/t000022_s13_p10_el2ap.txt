Among the 1,720 journals in the OLIVA database, we found
899 different publishers which shows the diversity of the Latin
American circuit. However, it is worth pointing out the institutions
that publish a great number of the journals: 38% of
the total are published by only 53 mega universities, while
the remaining 62% are published by 846 institutions. Table 2
shows the institutions that publish the largest number of journals.
