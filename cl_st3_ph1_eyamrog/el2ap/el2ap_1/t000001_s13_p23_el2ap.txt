Heterogeneity occurs when there is not a single underlying genome
but rather a mixture of two or more alternatives. This
can occur at small scales (e.g. a mixture of different
bases at a locus) or large scales (e.g. a mixture
of structural configurations). When heterogeneity occurs at a low level
(e.g. 95% of the reads support one sequence and 5%
another), it does not typically cause problems as assemblers/polishers will
use the more common alternative. However, balanced heterogeneity (e.g. a
50:50 mixture) can cause misassemblies and polishing mistakes. The phase
variation of the fim switch is one cause of heterogeneity
in Enterobacteriaceae44 (Figure 2E). Another common example occurs with bacteriophages,
which can integrate into and excise from bacterial chromosomes45 (Figure
2F). Heterogeneity can be identified by incomplete assembly graphs and
dense clusters of changes made by a polisher. It may
then be necessary to manually exclude reads which support one
alternative, allowing the other alternative to assemble/polish cleanly.
