In CEAP pedagogy, technological devices may be used to assess
students’ performance in CEAP tasks, their development throughout classes, and
the validity of the courses (cf. Chun, 2009). The advent
of new modes of instruction (computer-assisted language learning - CALL
and distance or blended learning) is one of the major
benefits ICT brought to CEAP courses’ implementation (cf. Arnó-Macià &
Rueda-Ramos, 2011). Finally, insofar as CEAP course design is concerned,
ICT may be used for the elaboration of tasks, syllabus
structuration, and needs analysis, for analyzing the present (cf. Vieira
& Aranha, 2015a, 2015b; Vieira, 2017; Aranha & Vieira, 2018,
Vieira, 2020) or target situation (Vieira, 2019b). The next section
focuses on the use of ICT in the target situation
analysis.
