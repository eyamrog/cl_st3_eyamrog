Considerable documentation and description now exists for the Paresi language.
Ana Paula Brandão and Glauber Silva independently documented the language
over several years. Among the main descriptive works for Paresi
are Silva (2009, 2013) and Brandão (2010, 2014). Work with
EN is quite recent, on the other hand; the only
known descriptive works are Rezende (2003, 2013),16 Brandão and Reis
(2020), Reis (2020). In 2005, the project ‘Sketch grammar, texts,
and dictionary of Enawene Nawe (Arawak, Brazil)’ was funded by
the Endangered Languages Documentation Program (ELDP), but unfortunately the project
was not completed. In 2019, Brandão received funding from the
ELDP, through the Federal University of Pará, for the project
‘Documentation of the Enawene Nawe language’.
