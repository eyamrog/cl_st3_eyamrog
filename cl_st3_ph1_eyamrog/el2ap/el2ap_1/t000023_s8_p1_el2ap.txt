Originally described by Ralfs in 1848, genus Cosmarium Corda gathers
over 1,500 taxa and consists in the most numerous and
one of the oldest genera of family Desmidiaceae. Genus is
composed by usually free-living single cells with a median constriction
that vary from a deep closed depression to a widely
open and shallow one, that divides the cell into two
symmetrical semicells and vary in shape and size depending on
the species (Bicudo & Menezes 2017). Taxonomy of Cosmarium is
primarily based on the cell outline and cell wall ornamentation.
For practical purposes, however, taxonomists tend to divide it into
two artificial groups: one with ornamented cell walls (ornamentation varying
from small granules to scrobiculations and tiny spines) and the
other one with smooth or finely punctate cell wall.
