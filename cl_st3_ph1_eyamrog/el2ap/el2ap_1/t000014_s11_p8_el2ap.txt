While the above-named archives cover a wide range of geographic
locations and collecting requirements, they might not be a good
fit for all language documentation projects. Alternative archives include other
types of digital data repositories such as those managed by
many universities. Linguistic datasets (but not primary data from language
documentation) may be submitted to the Troms√∏ Repository of Language
and Linguistics (TROLLing, https://site.uit.no/trolling/about/). Primary and secondary data, as well
as datasets, may be archived in general data repositories such
as Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/) and the Harvard DataVerse (https://dataverse.harvard.edu/). Additional possibilities
can be found in the Registry of Research Data Repositories
(https://www.re3data.org/).
