On the other hand, social sharing involves the exchange of
experiences and feelings with other teachers, superiors, teaching staff, friends,
and family (BURIĆ et al., 2016; SUTTON, 2004). Teachers who
perceived social support highlighted the relevance of this strategy in
expanding their regulatory repertoire and reducing negative emotions. Sharing emotions
helps relieve stress, build resilience, promote effective teaching, and increase
well-being (CLARÀ, 2017).
