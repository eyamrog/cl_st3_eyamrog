If the differences between groups are important, the similarities are
a point of analysis of the problem. In both groups,
age, sex, urbanity and the educational model (Cuban program in
preschool education) were controlled. Therefore, these variables do not justify
the neuropsychological variability between the groups. Similarly, the variables right-left
orientation, similarity and differences, as well as manual laterality did
not show differences between the groups.
