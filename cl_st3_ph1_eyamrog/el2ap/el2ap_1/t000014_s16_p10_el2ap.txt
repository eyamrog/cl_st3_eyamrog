Alongside the Goeldi Museum, few other Brazilian institutions are involved
in archiving initiatives. Currently, the principal effort is based at
the Museu do Índio in Rio de Janeiro, a component
of the Fundação Nacional do Índio. Over time, this museum
has systematically increased its infrastructure and has developed impressive digital
storage and backup capacities. The Museu do Índio has also
been conducting active projects to document indigenous languages and cultures,
following the best international practices. Its digital archive contains approximately
10 TB of linguistic documentation, including the languages of 25
indigenous groups. It also contains 9 TB of cultural documentation
from 27 indigenous groups, which includes recordings of linguistic interest.
Outputs of the ‘Indigenous Sonorities’ project (focusing on cultural preservation
via audio documentation) for five indigenous groups occupy 1.69 TB.
The total content of the file occupies approximately 50 TB.
Copies of all recordings are returned to the communities involved,
but Internet access is still being resolved.
