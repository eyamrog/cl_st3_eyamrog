Cognitive development in early childhood creates the foundation for a
favorable schooling trajectory in childhood and adolescence, as well as
academic and occupational success in adulthood (Doebel, 2020). In many
low- and middle-income Latin American countries, more than half of
children demonstrate a delay in cognitive proficiency when they enter
basic education (Abufhele et al., 2021; Borrescio & Valenzuela, 2021;
Vollman & Richland, 2020). These children are not sufficiently prepared
to learn and often face additional difficulties in school. Moreover,
in recent decades there has been an increase in learning
and behavioral disorders associated with alterations in cognitive development during
the first years of life (Albes et al., 2021). To
reduce this school entry gap, it is necessary to detect
difficulties in cognitive development early on in order to be
able to intervene in time and not perpetuate the lack
of academic, socioeconomic and social mobility opportunities. However, there are
currently few culturally validated instruments in Latin America. This study
attempts to fill this research gap in the cultural context
of Cuba, where adequate cognitive development in early childhood is
a major concern of educators and researchers.
