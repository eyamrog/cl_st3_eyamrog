The case of the authors from Chile, 75% of whom
have published in journals of their own country, is certainly
a high value but lower than other cases. Journals from
Colombia, Brazil and Mexico are important recipients of Chilean authors'
submissions within the region. This type of distribution may be
linked to greater pressure from the assessment culture of Chilean
institutions which discourages publishing in the nationally edited journals and
provides direct incentives for international collaboration, as was already mentioned
in the discussion of Figure 3. On the other hand,
authors from Colombia, Cuba and Mexico tend to make their
submissions to their nationally edited journals, although not at the
same degree as described for Brazil.
