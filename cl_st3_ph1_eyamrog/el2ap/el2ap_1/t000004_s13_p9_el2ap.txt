Capoeira is referred to as a game (jogo in Portuguese),
therefore it is played, not fought. The participants are arranged
in a circle, or roda in Portuguese. The word roda
can also denominate the social gathering in which capoeira is
played. Capoeira is played to music, produced by the orchestra,
or bateria in Portuguese. The orchestra is also situated at
the perimeter of the circle, and the musicians sit on
chairs or a bench.
