Our interviews with football club organisers, and managers, gave us
a window on the amount of organisation that went into
the clubs. Most of those who took on a leadership
role in a particular club were able to communicate in
English with some ease and fluency. They also had funds
of knowledge about UK practices around fund-raising, and around the
scheduling and the organising of sports events in Northern Ireland.
They had to find funding for the team and for
the tournaments. They also had to book pitches for the
tournaments and hire Irish referees. In addition, they had to
arrange local sponsorship. A local law firm sponsored Ramkabian and
a local taxi firm in Cookstown sponsored Fitun Unidade. The
sponsorship funded the purchase of football shirts and jackets for
the players, along with medals and cups for the football
tournaments. Two of the players in the Lao Rai club
had been in the national team of Timor- Leste before
migrating to Northern Ireland, so they also brought a professional
touch to the organisation of that clubâ€™s activities.
