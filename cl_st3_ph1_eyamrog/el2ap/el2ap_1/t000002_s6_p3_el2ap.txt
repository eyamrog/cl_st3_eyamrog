The second method explored in the paper is sociocultural discourse
analysis. It gives prominence to the contextual and situatedness of
turns of speech while deepening the meaning of contributions. Qualitative
analysis can highlight the "participants' underlying intentions and responses to
others moreover enables the researcher to go beyond the data,
for instance to identify missed opportunities for extension or challenge."
(Hennessy et al., 2020, p. 6). Categorising extracts as a
whole can build models rather than recording the presence/absence of
target discourse moves in a way in which categories/typologies are
generated as outcomes rather than predetermined (Mercer, 2010).
