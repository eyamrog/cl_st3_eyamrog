Demultiplexing errors can occur in multiplexed sequencing runs: reads from
one barcode can ‘leak’ into another, resulting in low-level contamination41.
When a sequence in one barcode is very high depth,
it may appear in other barcodes at sufficient depths to
be assembled. This most often occurs with high-copy-number plasmids (Figure
2D), so when multiple genome assemblies from the same sequencing
run contain identical plasmids, cross-barcode contamination should be considered as
a possible cause.
