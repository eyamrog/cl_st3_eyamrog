The present investigation focused on vocational and technological education due
to the complexity of this context. It is a hybrid
model of education, encompassing different levels and modalities of education,
ranging from basic education to higher education (baccalaureate and graduate
programs), in addition to professional and continuing education courses, involving
research, extension, and activities related to technological development (PACHECO; MORIGI,
2012). It is assumed that such characteristics imply a broad
and diversified audience with increasing emotional demands on the teacher
(MORAIS; GONDIM; PALMA, 2020). The recent implementation of this model
and the scarcity of research on psychosocial issues in this
context were also considered.
