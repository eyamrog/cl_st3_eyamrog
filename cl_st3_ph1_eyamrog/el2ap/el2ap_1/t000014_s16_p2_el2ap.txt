In what follows, we describe the collection of indigenous language
materials housed at the Goeldi Museum (Belém, Brazil), as a
concrete example of a language archive based in Brazil –
how it began and was created, and what it contains
(§3.1). We then provide a brief overview of other digital
language archiving initiatives in Brazil (§3.2), of which the Museu
do Índio is currently the principal exemplar.8 We also describe
several language documentation projects and their outcomes as an illustration
of the general need for documentation and archiving in the
country, and discuss the potential of regional archives.
