Target situation analysis (TSA) is one of the main investigations
to be conducted during needs analysis for CEAP course design.
It comprehends what the learner needs to know to function
effectively in the target situation (Songhori, 2008). TSA, then, is
one of the procedures taken by the teacher in ESP/CEAP
pedagogy to assure specificity, so they understand how language is
used in the target discourse community and then can translate
studentsâ€™ needs into linguistic, literacy, and pedagogical tasks.
