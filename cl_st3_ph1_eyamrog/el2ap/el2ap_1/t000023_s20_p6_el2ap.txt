Note: Only a single specimen of this species was found
during the present study, which was a little different from
the ones in Br√©bisson (1856) and Coesel & Meesters (2007).
Present specimens were slightly convex at the middle of the
apex instead of a truncate one, and concave instead of
straight apical angles.
