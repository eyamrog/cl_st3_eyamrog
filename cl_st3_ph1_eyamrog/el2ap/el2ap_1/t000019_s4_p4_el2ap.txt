Although the BNCC's guidance on DICT is not critical and
emancipatory, we understand that its absence in schools only denies
its materiality in today's real concrete society, which also fuels
the status quo of the dominant classes. By denying the
integration of ICT in school processes, under the discourse that
not everyone has the capacity to access them, it neither
protects those who do not have access, nor fights for
improvements in conditions that need to change to stop feeding
the system that excludes them. Furthermore, by not integrating ICT
in school processes, the opportunity to do so from a
critical perspective is lost, and ensures continued space for instrumental
and deterministic interpretations to consolidate, more and more.
