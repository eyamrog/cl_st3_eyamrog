We hypothesize that opportunism allows species to facultatively engage in
cleaning interactions to obtain resources. We derived two predictions from
this hypothesis. First, we expect that cleaners show higher diet
generalism than closely related species (Fig 1A). If opportunism is
the leading factor shaping cleaning interactions, opportunist species that already
show generalist diets would add additional resources (mainly mammalian ectoparasites
and damaged fleshy tissues) to their diets. Second, we expect
opportunistic species to interact with more mammalian hosts and with
hosts that are used by most of the other cleaning
species, i.e., we expect that opportunistic species are the central
species of the network (Fig 1B). We test these two
predictions with two continent-level networks that depict information on natural
history of cleaning interactions among birds and mammalian hosts in
Africa and South America (Sazima et al. 2012; Mikula et
al. 2017).
