Documents disseminate statements about the world in which we live
that both intend to offer unique representations of reality and
bring idealized solutions to diagnosed problems. It should be noted
that any discourse, by emphasizing certain objects and certain concepts,
omits others [...] this distorted discourse can help dominant groups,
but it is doubtful whether these benefits will be shared
by those who do not belong to these groups. (Ball,
1994 apud Shiroma et al., 2005, p. 439).
