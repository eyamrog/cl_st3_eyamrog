In this section, the complexity of language teaching and learning
in CEAP courses is explored to justify the need for
a contextual target situation analysis during needs analysis, which is
not common in EAP/ESP literature. Afterwards, the use of ICT
for such an investigation is presented, as a way to
carry it out during the design of online CEAP courses.
