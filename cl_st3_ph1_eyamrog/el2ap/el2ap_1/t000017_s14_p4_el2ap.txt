The data were collected in the final evaluation of the
educational process, between June and July 2019 in nine groups
of children, where each educator conducted the evaluation of her
group (nine female educators). For this, the educators were trained
at the beginning of the school year between September and
October 2018 through methodological workshops, two weekly sessions of 45
minutes each for one month. The educators obtained good grades
in the training, learned how to apply the instrument and
how to use it in the educational process to direct
the education and development of the child. With these results,
the educators evaluated the children at the end of the
school year and this was done individually in two sessions
lasting between 10 and 15 minutes each. The sessions were
generally conducted in the morning and the standardized protocol of
the B- PREA-R was used.
