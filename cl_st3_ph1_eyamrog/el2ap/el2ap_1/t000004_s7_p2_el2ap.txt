In this paper we examine the potential of a diasporic
capoeira group, based in Leeds UK as an opportunity for
Portuguese language learning. Capoeira, as we learned in our study,
is a practice with a long and contested history. We
will begin by outlining the history and practice of capoeira,
going on to consider its potential for informal language learning,
both in terms of the opportunities or affordances it offers
and the evidence we have that capoeiristas are learning elements
of Portuguese, which we might call Portuguese for Capoeira Purposes.
The learning of Languages for Specific Purposes, draws on the
linguistic construct of register. Our starting point was to ask
what is the potential for Afro-Brazilian Portuguese language and culture
learning of capoeira and on the other, what do apprentice
capoeiristas need to know of Afro-Brazilian Portuguese language and culture
to participate effectively in capoeira? However as our analysis progressed
we found our scope expanding in significant ways.
