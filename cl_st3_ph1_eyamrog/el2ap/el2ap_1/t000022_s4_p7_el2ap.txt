The forms of collaboration shown by the journals indexed in
SciELO and Redalyc, and their academic and university attachment, show
that this is a system that promotes broad dissemination and
multi-scale research programs, which can very effectively address the current
needs of scholarly communication in times of open science. This
is not only based on Latin American capabilities in terms
of professional scientific publishing, indexing and open access, but also
on its experience in producing interoperable regional indicators as demonstrated
in the joint publication developed in collaboration with the main
indexing systems in the region, PKP and CLACSO (Alperin, Babini
and Fischmann, 2014). More efforts in this direction to improve
the visibility and comparability of Latin American production will enable
the region to counteract a major trend in two and,
until now, separate but increasingly intrinsically linked forces: commercial threats
to the open science movement and the urgent need for
a reform of the traditional forms of research assessment. It
is our hope that the OLIVA project will stimulate more
and more collaborative spaces to promote a socially relevant and
participatory science.
