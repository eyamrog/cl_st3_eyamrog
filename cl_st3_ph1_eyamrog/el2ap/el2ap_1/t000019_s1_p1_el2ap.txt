The recommendation for the integration of Information and Communication Technologies
(ICT) for Basic Education, in Brazil, has become more forceful
with each curricular reform, under the justification that it is
very relevant knowledge for actively participating in the 21st Century.
With the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, there was a significant
stimulus to the uses of these technologies to support different
forms of education, commonly called emergency remote education. Within this
scenario, this article aims to discuss the conceptions of technology
in the basic education curriculum and the real conditions of
access to ICT. So that, literature review and documentary research
were carried out. The document outlining the National Common Curricular
Base (BNCC) of Brazilian education together with data from the
Brazilian Internet Steering Committee census regarding access to ICT in
schools and homes were analyzed. It has been noticed that
research carried out in public schools over the last 8
years, already denounced the lack of investment in technology and
in teacher training for the use of ICT in these
schools. In other words, the exposure caused by the pandemic
only led to broader public knowledge of what was already
the precarious reality in Brazilian public schools. The theoretical conception
that prevails in BNCC is not of integral formation, but
instrumental. Although national curriculum recommendations increasingly encourage the use of
ICT in school spaces, the reality exposes that investments in
human and technological resources are not compatible even for limited
instrumental teaching, even with the social pertinence of the theme.
