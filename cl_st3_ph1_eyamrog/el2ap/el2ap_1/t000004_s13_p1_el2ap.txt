Sandroâ€™s contextualization of capoeira practice for the group is saturated
with the history of black Brazilians. It is therefore important
to locate the practice historically and describe the context in
which capoeira emerged and evolved, that is, the colonial period,
which started with the arrival of the Portuguese in 1500
and was characterised by the use of slave labour as
well as by slave resistance. What follows is a brief
overview addressing a complex topic. The Portuguese started to colonize
the North-Eastern coast, where the first cities and ports were
established. The tropical climate of these areas was suitable for
plantations of sugarcane, requiring a great deal of manual labour,
scarce in the recently-discovered territory (see SKIDMORE; GREEN, 2021).
