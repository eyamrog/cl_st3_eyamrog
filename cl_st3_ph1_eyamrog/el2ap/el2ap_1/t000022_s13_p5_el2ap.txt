The most notable growth in the number of journals and
articles occurred with the launching of Redalyc in 2005 which
began to index journals especially in the Social Sciences. As
seen in Figure 1, the peak is reached in 2015
which shows a sharp increase relative to some flattening of
the article curve beginning in 2011. The number of articles
and journals per year decreases in 2018 because there is
a delay between publishing and incorporation of the new issues
into the Redalyc and SciELO databases. This delay varies widely
from one publisher to the next and among countries, and
is due to a multitude of reasons such as delays
in publication or in the management of the databases, difficulties
in XML-JATS markup, or differing priorities which the publishing institutions
place on the inclusion of new issues in each database.
