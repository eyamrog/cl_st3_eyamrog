Nestedness patterns implies that the networks show asymmetries, in which
species with many interactions form a core of interactions, and
species with fewer interactions usually do not interact with each
other (Bascompte et al 2003). In contrast, modularity patterns imply
that most interactions are organized in modules, i.e., semi-isolated and
densely connected groups of interacting species (Olesen et al. 2007,
Pimm & Lawton 1990). These nonrandom patterns of the network
reflect (i) the variation in the average levels of specializations
and generalism and (ii) the nonrandom patterns of niche overlap
across different types of interaction (Guimarães 2020). In this sense,
the structure of ecological networks may partially encode the processes
shaping the ecological interactions and affecting the organization of ecological
communities (Jordano et al. 2003; Bastolla et al. 2009; Guimarães
2020).
