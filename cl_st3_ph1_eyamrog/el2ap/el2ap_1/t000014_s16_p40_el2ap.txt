Author O’Hagan was familiar with Weiss’s work in the context
of his own fieldwork with speakers of the related Caquinte
language, but in previous readings of his dissertation had skipped
over the section “Design and Method.” From it, however, we
learn of the existence – at least at a certain
point in time – of field notes, index cards (cf.
slips), biological specimens, photographs, and sound recordings. Gerald Weiss became
a professor of anthropology at Florida Atlantic University; a Google
search in March 2021 revealed that he was still affiliated
with that institution as an emeritus professor. Furthermore, a phone
call at the same time revealed that all the above-listed
materials – and more from postdoctoral research – were kept
at his home in Florida (see ANWAR, 2021 for more
details).
