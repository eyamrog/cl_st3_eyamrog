Google Scholar data affords further insight into the JUOJS by
offering article-level citation data (although by OJS installation domain rather
than by journal). The 22,679 JUOJS in Google Scholar (June
2022) were hosted on 8,548 OJS domains, with 2.7 journals
on average. Each identified domain was accompanied by the first
page of search results, with citation counts for roughly the
top ten articles by citation (Figure 10). This revealed that
34 (0.4%) of the 8,548 journal domains had over 10,000
citations among their first ten articles. 565 journal domains (6.6%)
had over 1,000 citations, and 1,015 journal domains (11.9%) had
over 500 citations. But then 547 domains (6.4%) had no
citations on the first page.16 The overall mean for the
JUOJSâ€™ first page of Google Scholar search results is 358.8
citations (median: 50.0).
