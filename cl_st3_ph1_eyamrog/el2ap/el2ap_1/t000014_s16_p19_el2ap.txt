Informed consent is a legal – at least in many
places, including Brazil – and moral obligation. It is, therefore,
essential that speakers/signers understand what their participation entails and, crucially,
what the consequences of digital archiving really are. One potential
challenge to informed consent with respect to archiving is that
of familiarity with archives and the Internet – and in
some instances, computers – on the part of the community
and/or the speakers. As Robinson (2010, p. 189) asks, “can
we obtain truly informed consent [for archiving] if the consultant
and the community have never seen a computer or heard
of an archive or the Internet?”. There are two additional
issues here. Firstly, research is by default open-ended. We generally
gather a corpus based on particular research questions but those
questions, or rather the answers to them, may lead to
new questions. Thus, when you gather consent at the beginning
of a project, if the goals of the project change
or new research questions arise, does the initial consent hold?
This is particularly difficult to anticipate with archived data, which
as we will see below can be reused by others.
Secondly, the descendants and communities of tomorrow may need these
materials for revitalization purposes, as described for example in Bomfim
(2017). In what follows, we exemplify these issues and propose
one approach, among many possible ones, to address some of
these concerns.
