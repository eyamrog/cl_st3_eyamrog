This data shows that the physical and technological inadequacies of
both urban and rural schools (which are even worse) cannot
sustain the pedagogical integration of DICT. In spite of the
fact that data shows that 64% of urban public schools
have computer labs, it must be made clear that they
are spaces that do not accommodate an entire class of
30 students, for example. Most of these laboratories (78%) have
less than six computers and only 9% have slightly more
than 21 computers (CGI.br, 2018b, 2019b). Most classes starting the
second phase of elementary school in Brazil have more than
35 students.
