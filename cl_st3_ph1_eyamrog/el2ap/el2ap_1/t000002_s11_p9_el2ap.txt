Notwithstanding the above, some researchers consider critical theory to be
a third research paradigm (Cohen et al., 2007; Guba &
Lincoln, 1994; Treagust et al., 2014). Researchers following this tradition
emphasise the political and ideological stances in human interaction, arguing
that factors such as power and inequality shape and forge
the ways that human beings live, behave and perceive reality
(Cohen et al., 2007).
