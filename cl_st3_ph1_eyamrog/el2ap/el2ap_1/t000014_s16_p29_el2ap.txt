A second community-wide meeting was held on November 4, 2012
in Arena Blanca after Rosés Labrada’s return with these screenshots.
The discussion that ensued was better informed in a number
of aspects. First, one request was that originals stay in
the community. This request allowed the linguist to provide further
explanation about the context of digital documentation: that specific recordings
were born digital, that originals and copies could be identical,
and that copies could be easily made—which would not necessarily
have been the case if we had recorded directly on
cassettes or CDs/DVDs, which the community was more familiar with.
