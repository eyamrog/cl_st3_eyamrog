Among the factors related to the mortality of the epiphyte
specimens, Jasper et al. (2005) cited the importance of the
efficient fixation to the host with materials that resist for
at least 10 months. With this in mind, the authors
used biodegradable string, while sisal was used in this work.
Due to this requirement, the direct relocation to soil can
be an interesting alternative to avoid the loss of the
rescued specimens (Jasper et al. 2005) in relation to facultative
species. Therefore, specimens with facultative habits, such as Aechmea calyculata
(E. Morren) Baker transplanted to the soil, showed 79.6% survival.
Freitas et al. (1998) performed transplant experiments to assess the
epiphytic growth of terricolous ramets of Nidularium procerum Lindman and
Nidularium innocentii Lemaire, two tank bromeliads considered facultative epiphytes, and
found that all ramets survived after two years.
