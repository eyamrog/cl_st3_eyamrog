Similar to the results of Taxer and Gross (2018), teachers
use more than one emotion regulation strategy at a time.
However, unlike their study, which highlighted the use of attention
deployment, the cognitive change stood out here, appearing linked to
situation modification (e.g., relational coping). That is, when facing a
difficult situation and talking to students about the event, the
teacher can both modify its impact by influencing student emotion
regulation (hetero- regulation) (TAXER; GROSS, 2018) and reinterpreting the negative
circumstances (self- regulation). The second most salient link was situation
selection (technical approach) and situation modification (technological confrontation). This suggests
that teachers use their previous experiences to anticipate emotions (their
own and others') and technical-pedagogical knowledge to plan, anticipate and
prepare for the negative circumstances that arise in the classroom
and modify them when they are unavoidable.
