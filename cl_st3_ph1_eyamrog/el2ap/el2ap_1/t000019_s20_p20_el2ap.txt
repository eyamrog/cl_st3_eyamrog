With regard to access at home, despite the research showing
interesting quantitative data such as, for example, that 67% of
the Brazilian population over 10 years old have internet and
more than 95% have cell phones (CGI.br, 2018a, 2019a), an
analysis of this data is needed to identify the bottlenecks
and show how much investment is still needed in this
area for the lower classes, especially if they require digital
environments to participate in distance activities. Of the internet that
appears in households, 56% is via cell phone and only
28% of these homes have some streaming service (Idem). This
means that access is limited and shared between the family,
both from the point of view of capacity and equipment,
because cell phones are not sufficient for the purposes of
study.
