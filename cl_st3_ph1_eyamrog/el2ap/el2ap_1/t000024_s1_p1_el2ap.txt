(Simultaneous relocation strategy of bromeliads as epiphytes or terricolous in
the Montane Dense Ombrophilous Forest of Parque Estadual da Cantareira,
São Paulo State, Brazil). Plant relocation resulting from vegetation removal
is an important conservation strategy. This work aimed to investigate
the simultaneous relocation of the bromeliads Aechmea distichantha Lem. and
Wittrockia cyathiformis (Vell.) Leme in epiphytic and terricolous form. These
bromeliads were rescued from deforested areas due to the construction
of a highway. Both were fixed onto tree trunks or
pitchforks or in the soil in a Montane Dense Ombrophilous
Forest area of Parque da Estadual Cantareira, São Paulo State,
Brazil. After one year A. distichantha maintained 100% survival rate,
when transplanted in terricolous and 83.33 % in epiphytic form,
while W. cyathiformis was 60% for both relocation forms. We
concluded that both bromeliad species could be simultaneously relocated as
epiphytes or terricolous. Direct relocation to the ground guarantees practicality,
as it is difficult to find trees with forks located
at small heights from the ground in which the manual
fixing of the plant could be done without equipment.
