The results indicated that A. distichantha might have greater adaptability
after relocation than W. cyathiformis. However, as mentioned earlier, survival
rates of both species were similar to those previously published
for other relocated bromeliads. It is worth adding that the
relocation form adopted for these species (i.e., epiphytic or terricolous)
could contribute to attracting pollinators, seed production, and the establishment
of new populations since W. cyathiformis is one facultative bromeliad
visited by birds (Cestari 2009), pollinated by hummingbirds (Kaehler et
al. 2005). The facultative A. distichantha (Mania 2010) can be
pollinated either by bees or hummingbirds (Scrok & Varassin 2011).
Considering pollination, Varassin and Sazima (2000) observed the hummingbirds Phaethornis
eurynome and Ramphodon naevius pollinating bromeliads in the lower strata
of the forest.
