The conditions on the ships were extremely harsh and around
10% of the Africans on board of ships sailing from
Africa to Brazil died (COHN, 1985; see also ALENCASTRO, 2018).
Once they reached their destination, the slaves were separated from
their linguistic group so that they couldnâ€™t communicate amongst each
other. They became the main labourers initially on plantations of
sugarcane and cotton, and later also in the mines and
on coffee plantations.
