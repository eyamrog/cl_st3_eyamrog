In terms of use of language for instruction, English language
prevailed at the capoeira classes we have observed in the
practice phase some of the short instructions were in Portuguese
(rolê – roll, troca – change, desce – go down).
Also, Sandro was using Portuguese to communicate with the expert
users of Portuguese, and occasionally with the whole group.
