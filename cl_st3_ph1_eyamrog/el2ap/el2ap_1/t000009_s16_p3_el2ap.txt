Once both genres circulate in a variety of contexts (production,
legitimation, publication, distribution, and preservation) (cf. Khosrowjerdi, 2011), the contextual
TSA focused on the contexts in which the students have
active participation, starting from production and ending in the publication
process of research articles. Still, an array of subjects, institutions
and factors are involved in those processes, such as authors,
referees, funding agencies, and so on. Thus, the contextual investigation
mainly focused on understanding research article production and publication in
high-impact journals through the lens of those whom the target
students wish to become in a near future: the authors.
