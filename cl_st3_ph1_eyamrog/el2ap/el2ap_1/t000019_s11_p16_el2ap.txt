As for ICT, for example, many people use cell phones
daily. However, most of them, if asked to open their
e-mail on a computer, do not know how, because they
do not know what a browser, website or e-mail is,
they do not know if they have a password, etc.
These tools are used as applications on cell phones that
are regularly open, and donÂ´t require much knowledge for daily
use. Knowledge of everyday use does not mean dominance to
the point that the person knows how to use it
in his / her favor in other situations (Souza et
al., 2020; Peixoto, 2010) where they may require a little
more knowledge, for example, in professional situations or to resolve
academic issues.
