At the same time, we are keenly aware of the
fact that south-north migration is bound up with global asymmetries
of power and with the major economic shifts taking place
in late capitalism. As Adey (2006, p. 85-86) has pointed
out: “Mobility, like power, is a relational thing” and it
is unevenly distributed. The mobility of some social actors needs
to be viewed in relation to the immobility of others,
and moving north and west, from the global south, rarely
involves retaining the same positioning with the social hierarchy. As
Duchêne and Heller (2012, p. 15-16) remind us: “The landscape
is uneven, unbounded and fluid and (…) social actors occupy
different (and differently advantageous) positions with respect to access to
the resources that circulate across it”.
