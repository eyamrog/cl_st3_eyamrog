To understand how the diversity of diet of birds influences
the cleaning associations among birds (cleaners) feed on parasites or
injured tissue of mammals (clients), we first calculated a diversity
diet index (H) for all bird species using the Elton
Traits database, EltonTraits 1.0: Species-level foraging attributes of the world’s
birds and mammals (Wilman H, et al. 2014). In this
database, the diet of each bird species is categorized in
terms of broad diet categories (Supplementary figure 1 a). We
used these categories to estimate the diet diversity of each
bird species by computing the Shannon’s Diversity Index (Shannon 1948):
<>, in which Hj is the diet diversity of species
j, R is the number of diet categories (resources), pi
is the proportion of diet category i in the diet
of species j. In short, the higher the H value
of the species, the higher is the diversity of diet
resources each individual of the species can consume. Based on
the two predictions divided previously (figure 1), we divided the
methods in two sections: section (a) and section (b). In
section (a) we compared the H values of cleaner bird
species from Brazilian and African cleaning networks (Sazima et al.
2012; Mikula et al. 2017) with the H observed in
non cleaning closed-related species. In section (b) we tested if
the values of H demonstrate a correlation with the centrality
degree of both networks. The summary of the methods is
represented in figure 2.
