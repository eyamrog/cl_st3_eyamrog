On average, 70% of the population has access to the
Internet, but more than 90% is via cell phone (CGI.br,
2019a). On the one hand, cell phone access helps because
it increases the chance of accessing the Internet, but on
the other hand, it can indicate both loss of purchasing
power and little knowledge about computer uses, and / or
difficulty in purchasing computers and contracting better internet services. The
cell phone is also associated with faster, everyday operational uses,
which does not always indicate the mastery of academic and
professional knowledge of these tools. For the purposes of longer
studies, for example, reading and tasks requiring digital production, the
most suitable devices are computers.
