By analyzing 25,671 journals largely absent from common journal counts,
as well as Web of Science and Scopus, this study
demonstrates that scholarly communication is more of a global endeavor
than is commonly credited. These journals, employing the open source
publishing platform Open Journal Systems (OJS), have published 5.8 million
items; they are in 136 countries, with 79.9% in the
Global South and 84.2% following the OA diamond model (charging
neither reader nor author). A substantial proportion of journals operate
in more than one language (48.3%), with research published in
a total of 60 languages (led by English, Indonesian, Spanish,
and Portuguese). The journals are distributed across the social sciences
(45.9%), STEM (40.3%), and the humanities (13.8%). For all their
geographic, linguistic, and disciplinary diversity, 1.2% are indexed in the
Web of Science and 5.7% in Scopus. On the other
hand, 1.0% are found in Cabells Predatory Reports, while 1.4%
show up in Beallâ€™s questionable list. This paper seeks to
both contribute and historically situate expanded scale and diversity of
scholarly publishing in the hope that this recognition may assist
humankind in taking full advantage of what is increasingly a
global research enterprise.
