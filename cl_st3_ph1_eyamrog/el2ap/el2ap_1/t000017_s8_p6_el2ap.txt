Considering this limitation, Ramirez et al. (2018) developed the PreAcademic
Battery (B-PREA), which assesses cognitive development in children between 4
and 6 years old and helps determine whether a child
is ready to start schooling. The application of the B-PREA
does not require much time, between 20 and 25 minutes.
The battery has two theoretical antecedents: (1) the contributions of
Luria's theory in the preschool stage (Solovieva & Quintanar, 2013;
Manga & Ramos, 2006) and (2) the foundations of cognitive
neuropsychology on the development of tests for preschool children (Tenorio
et al., 2014; Portellano, 2000). However, the B-PREA remains a
complex test for preschool educators.
