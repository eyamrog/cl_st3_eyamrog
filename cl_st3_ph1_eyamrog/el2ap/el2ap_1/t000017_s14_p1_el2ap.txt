The study sample included 300 preschoolers between four and six
years of age (between 46 and 82 months), 100 children
between 46 and 58 months (equivalent to pre- kindergarten), 100
between 60 and 70 months (equivalent to kindergarten) and 100
between 72 and 82 months (equivalent to first grade in
Cuba) of both sexes (54% boys and 46% girls), from
three educational institutions in the city of Cienfuegos, Cuba. The
educational institutions were chosen because they are centers with more
than 150 children enrolled and come from different areas of
the province.
