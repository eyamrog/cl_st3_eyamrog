Indeed, a number of network patterns can be explained by
differences in abundance among species (VÃ¡zquez et al. 2005, 2007;
Lewinsohn et al. 2006) which suggest, in turn, that opportunism
has a central role in the organization of many ecological
networks. Opportunism may allow species to engage in new types
of interactions, exploring novel resources and structuring, at the community
level, networks of interacting species. To engage in new interactions,
those species should be able, by their traits and behavior,
to interact with a broad diversity of individuals and species.
Thus, not only resource availability would determine the engagement of
new interactions and the opportunistic behavior, but also the diversity
of resource consumption.
