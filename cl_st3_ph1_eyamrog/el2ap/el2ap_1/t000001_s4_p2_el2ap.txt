While perfect bacterial genome assemblies are now possible, they are
not yet simple to produce. The future will undoubtedly bring
improvements to ONT chemistry, basecallers and polishers, but whether these
will be sufficient for perfect ONT-only assemblies (negating the need
for Illumina reads) remains to be seen. Further software developments
are needed to remove the human-interaction elements, enabling perfect assemblies
from a fully automated pipeline, even in complicated cases (e.g.
genomes with heterogeneity). The ultimate goal is a future where
genomes can be assembled to perfection with enough ease and
reliability that it is taken for granted.
