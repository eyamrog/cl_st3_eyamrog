In the simplest scenario, individuals of different species are generalists,
interacting with partners in an opportunistic way, e.g., feeding on
resources in the frequency they are available in the environment.
Although there is compelling evidence of departures of the patterns
of interaction expected by the availability of resources (Olesen et
al. 2011; Kuebbing et al. 2013; Pekkonen et al. 2013),
the assumption that individuals interact as opportunistic foragers allows insights
on the organization of ecological networks. Specifically, opportunism at the
individual level implies that, at the species level, variation in
number of interactions across species would be correlated with species
abundances (Vazquez et al. 2007; Krishna et al. 2008).
