One of the strengths of sociocultural discourse analysis is that
“the actual talk remains the data throughout the analysis and
so the processes of the joint construction of knowledge can
be examined in detail” (Mercer, 2004, p. 143). Thus, here,
the focus is not the discursive functions or the language
itself but the content of talk and the pursuit of
joint intellectual activity (Mercer, 2004). It is an inductive approach
to inquiry from which themes or categories should emerge from
the data (Evans, 2013; Taber, 2013).
