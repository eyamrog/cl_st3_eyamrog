The football tournaments involving these Timorese teams in Dungannon and
Cookstown, were (and still are) scheduled to coincide with dates
of national, political significance in Timor-Leste. They are held either
on May 20 (the anniversary of Independence) or on August
30 (the anniversary of the decisive Referendum on Independence in
1999). In Figure 3 below, we include two photographs of
the cup won by Fitun Unidade in the 2014 tournament
of May 20, along with the medals won by individual
players (e.g. as man of the match, or as highest
goal scorer).
