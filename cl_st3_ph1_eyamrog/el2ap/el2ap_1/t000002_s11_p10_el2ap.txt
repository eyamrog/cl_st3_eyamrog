The existence of many research paradigms might not be a
problem in itself, especially in educational research. Treagust and colleagues
(2014) advocate that this diversity promotes the construction of more
balanced knowledge and broader effort. In same position, Taber (2013)
acknowledges that any paradigm has strengths and limitations, thus any
of them can produce valuable knowledge and can be employed
in complementary ways.
