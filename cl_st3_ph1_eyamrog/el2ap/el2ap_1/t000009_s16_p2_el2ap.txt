In 2014, Vieira conducted a detailed needs analysis to investigate
the purposes for which Brazilian computer science graduates need English
in the academic environment. Results indicated that students’ immediate need
is to write research articles and abstracts. Departing from this
result, a TSA focused on both genres was recently conducted.
Besides a textual analysis (to be presented in future work),
a contextual analysis was done to investigate critical issues that
regulate the use of both genres by the community. More
specifically, the contextual TSA presented here aimed at identifying issues
that might influence the acceptance of Brazilian computer scientists’ papers
in high-impact journals.
