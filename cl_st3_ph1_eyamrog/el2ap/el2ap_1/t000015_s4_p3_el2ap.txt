Yet there is something more at issue with the global
scale of this publishing activity that aligns with the point
made Achille Mbembe at the University of the Witwatersrand, in
paying tribute to Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o’s re-centering project of the
last century, that “the decolonizing project is back on the
agenda worldwide” (2019, p. 18, original emphasis). Mbembe envisions this
agenda transforming universities into “platforms for the redistribution of different
kinds of knowledges” (p. 7, original emphasis). This, too, is
a part of what we have found here, linguistically and
geopolitically. It suggests that another world of scholarly communication –
more broadly global, diverse, and inclusive – is not just
possible or on the agenda.22 It is already underway for
the benefit of all.
