In conclusion the dehydration stems and leaves of liana A.
crucigerum, after 48 h field sampling, showed a significantly stiffer
response compared to hydrated samples. In addition, the size of
the dehydration effect is smaller on lianas compared to other
habits, due to the unique anatomical structure of the lianas.
Therefore, we recommend that to assess the biomechanical properties of
plant organs in their natural condition, researchers should carry out
their experiments with samples kept consistently moist or immediately after
collection in the field. Our results improve our understanding about
the biomechanical properties in the stems and leaves of lianas
and provide support for current protocols used in biomechanics of
plants.
