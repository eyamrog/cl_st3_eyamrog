Another important point, Luria's contributions, defend the idea of information
feedback, i.e., several criteria from different sources confirm a weakness
or a strength in the subject. To take an example,
the educator observes in the institution if the child draws
concentrated in his activity, if he holds the pencil well,
executes the actions according to the indicated orientation and if
he enjoys the activity, however, the educator has the obligation
to ask the parents: if the child picks up the
toys when instructed, if he eats slowly and uses the
utensils, if he bathes or dresses himself, or if he
plays with a partner respecting the rules, with respect, affection
and companionship. The triangulation of information between the educator and
the family is a valuable tool in the educational process,
since the educator identifies and verifies the needs of the
child and the family, and thus directs her educational work
from this result and in correspondence with the objects outlined.
