At the end of the era in which the plant
Classification Systems were mostly based on morphological data, Dennstaedtiaceae was
considered a big family, comprehending three subfamilies (or tribes) and
about 17 genera (Tryon & Tryon 1982, Kramer 1990). With
the advent of molecular data, those subfamilies were raised to
family-level, some families were created, and now the early- diverging
leptosporangiate ferns are represented by Cystodiaceae (one genus), Dennstaedtiaceae with
a stricter circumscription (11-12 genera), Lindsaeaceae (seven genera), Lonchitidaceae (one
genus), Saccolomataceae (one or two genera), as well as the
great Pteridaceae (+50 genera) (Smith et al. 2006, PPG I
2016, Shang et al. 2018, Schwartsburd et al. 2020).
