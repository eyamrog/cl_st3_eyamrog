Statistical analysis - To test the effect of gradual dehydration
overtime on structural Young’s modulus, fracture toughness, and relative water
content in stems and leaves, we constructed linear and nonlinear
mixed model, estimating the parameters by restricted maximum likelihoods (REML).
In these models, time was used as an independent variable
separately, and samples were always included as a random term.
The random term herein explicitly describes aspects of our sampling
design, i.e., repeated measurements of each sample over time. Similarly,
nonlinear mixed models were constructed to evaluate the direct effect
of relative water content on structural Young’s modulus of stems
and fracture toughness of leaves undergoing gradual dehydration. Exponential nonlinear
models were used to represent best-fitted curves, similar to those
applied by Boldrin et al. (2018) and Scoffoni et al.
(2014). The models were submitted to residual analysis, checking model
assumptions graphically (Crawley 2007). Finally, the models were tested by
analyses of variance (ANOVA), considering P-value ≤ 0.05 as the
threshold for significance (Zar 1996). We performed all statistical analyses
using R version 3.6.1 (R Core Team 2019) and the
R packages lme4 (Bates 2010).
