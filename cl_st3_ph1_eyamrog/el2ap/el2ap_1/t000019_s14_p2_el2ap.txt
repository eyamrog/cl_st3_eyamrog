Cury (1986, p. 27) explains that contradiction is a basic
category of MHD dialectics. Contradiction is the “[...] internal motor
of development, it reflects the most original movement of the
real”. The search for contradictions, whether in documents or empirical
manifestations, aims to highlight the historicity and complexity of social
relations, which helps to demystify deterministic positions.
