In the present research, a cross-sectional comparative study was conducted
in the period from January to December 2019. From a
total of seventy-seven children aged 5 and 6 years with
typical development, they were selected and subdivided into groups according
to the province of the country (Sancti Spíritus and Cienfuegos)
(Table 1). The groups were balanced following the criteria of
methodological parity according to sex in the different provinces of
the country studied. The distribution analysis obtained a normal equivalence
between both groups (χ2: 0.633).
