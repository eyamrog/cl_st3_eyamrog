As for other public spaces that could serve the population
with access to computers and the internet, significant investments were
made, especially between 2002 and 2012 (Bueno, 2017). However, in
recent years, only 45% of them remain in operation and
conditions are insufficient, just as in schools (CGI.br, 2018b, 2019b).
These public spaces include libraries and technology centers, also known
as the Educational Technology Center (NTE). For some years these
were spaces open to the public where the population could
attend, free of charge, to do research on the internet.
They could also avail of such services as generate a
copy of their personal public accounts (utilities) to be paid,
enrollment for public services and tenders and digital services in
general. In addition, basic computer courses were offered to the
community and to teachers (Bueno, 2017). This type of location,
although not the main one for a student, served as
a support and complement for them and indeed for the
entire population.
