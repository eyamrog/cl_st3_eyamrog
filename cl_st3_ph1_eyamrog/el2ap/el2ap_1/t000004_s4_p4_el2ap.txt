The possibility to integrate systematic language learning in the structure
of the capoeira class has also been explored in the
recent curriculum proposal by Ministério das Relações Exteriores (2020) of
Português para capoeiristas. Taking a Language for Specific Purposes approach
it is a part of a wider collection of curricular
proposals of teaching Portuguese abroad in specific contexts, aiming at
filling in the methodological gap in teaching Portuguese in cultural
centres and affiliated institutions outside Brazil. The proposal makes use
of capoeira songs and texts and videos about capoeira, with
references beyond capoeira (e.g. the artist Caribé; Brazilian dances samba
de roda and frevo; singers such as Gilberto Gil, Dorival
Caymmi or Caetano Veloso). It recognises that some of the
language is used specifically in capoeira, with one entire unit
dedicated to ‘capoeira slang’ (Unidade 13: a gíria do capoeira).
Such an initiative to integrate Portuguese language teaching in the
frame of the capoeira classes is commendable as it is
a step towards a more independent use of the language,
which is necessary for progressing in capoeira, but it is
purely focussed on the linguistic aspect.
