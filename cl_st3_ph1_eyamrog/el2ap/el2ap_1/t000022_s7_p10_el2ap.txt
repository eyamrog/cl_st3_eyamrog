The OLIVA project database is made up of the collected
data of the journals indexed by SciELO and Redalyc, and
revised data from the published documents. Each of these indexing
systems collaborated by providing its historical database updated to June
2019. The data was subjected to data cleaning and deduplication
of the journals in common. The result was an integrated
bibliographic database for statistical purposes and is composed of the
following elements at the document level: type of document, date
of publication, language, and authorâ€™s country. It does not include
data on citations as this is outside the scope of
the project.
