The present investigation revealed that the neuropsychological performance of the
espirituanos was notably better than the cienfuegueros in the tests
that evaluated executive functions (manual motor skills, gestures and praxis,
verbal regulation), language (naming objects and figures, phonemic hearing, image
vocabulary and numerical operations), speed in naming colors and verbal
memory. Cienfuegos preschool children obtained better results in speed in
naming pictures and in visual memory. In intellectual performance, there
were also significant differences between the two groups.
