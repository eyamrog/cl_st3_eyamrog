Regarding experienced members, questionnaires, interviews, and field observation are common
instruments for data gathering, aiming at identifying the genres that
students might use in the target situation, as well as
the skills they must develop in their English abilities (cf.
Sarmento, 2012). Genre analysis, on the other hand, tends to
rely on texts produced and consumed by the community. It
can be done either in a textual perspective — through
which linguistic and rhetoric patterns of the target genre(s) are
identified (cf. Cheng, 2008) — or in an intertextual one,
aiming at identifying the genre system through which the members
carry out their activity (cf. Molle & Prior, 2008).
