Such analysis is often illustrated by selected extracts followed by
a commentary with reference to prior knowledge of both the
field and the context. It can be concerned with the
syntax and the cohesive structure of language to represent the
ways that knowledge is socially built in the classroom (Mercer,
2004). As dialogue remains untouchable throughout the analysis, the emerged
typologies offer a heuristic device for making sense of the
talk in relation to one particular issue (Mercer, 2004). For
instance, Mercerâ€™s studies identified three types of group talk: disputational,
cumulative, and exploratory; and verified that this last have a
positive impact on student learning. Thus, the point is not
to reduce the data to a categorical tally, but set
broad features that involve the context and the discursive dynamic
regarding an educational learning goal (Mercer et al., 2004). The
next subsection shows an example of the kind of research
questions and finding that sociocultural discourse analysis might provide.
