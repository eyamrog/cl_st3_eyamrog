The revised B-PREA (B-PREA-R) for educators is a necessity in
the Cuban educational context, and responds to several practical and

by educators in the preschool context, (3) the increase of
preschool children with developmental limitations in several provinces of Cuba
(Ramírez & Bernal, 2020; Íñiguez et al. , 2017),
