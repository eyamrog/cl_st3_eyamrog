Subsequent years saw more equipment purchased and more documentation projects
conducted. Throughout the evolution of the Goeldi Linguistics Area archive,
technology has evolved and formats and physical media have changed.
However, the conversion of all recordings to standardized digital form
has mitigated problems of longevity and compatability. Some devices, such
as microphones, do not become obsolete, and the various types
of recorders (DAT, mini-DV, etc.) that are currently not used
directly for documentation are maintained, since they can still be
used to access legacy recordings and produce a signal that
can be digitized. Original recordings are stored on their original
media in professional storage cabinets .
