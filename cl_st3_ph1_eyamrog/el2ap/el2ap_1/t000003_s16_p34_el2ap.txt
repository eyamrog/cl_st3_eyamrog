In addition to the annual tournaments, individual clubs organise friendly
matches with Timorese teams in other regions of the UK.
Thus, we learned that, in 2014, the FC Lao Rai
United football team extended its range of football fixtures and
travelled to Northwich, just south of Manchester, in England for
a friendly match with a Timorese football team there. Since
then, there have been other friendly matches and tournaments (e.g.
in Oxford and in Peterborough). Photographs and video-recordings of all
of these matches, and the festivities following the matches, are
posted on Facebook and on YouTube. They are viewed and
commented on (mostly in Tetum) by friends and family members
in Timor-Leste and by other Timorese across the diaspora, in
the UK, in Portugal, in South Korea and in Australia.
There is considerable interest in football in Timor-Leste. There is
a national team and, as noted earlier, a former member
of that team was playing for the FC Lao Rai
team in Dungannon when we carried out our research. Football
is also played in local schools in Timor-Leste but there
are insufficient resources to organise regional football teams. The matches
of leading football clubs in Europe (e.g., the national team
of Portugal or regional clubs in the UK, such as
Manchester United) can be viewed on television or online in
Timor-Leste and choosing to support particular football teams has become
quite popular.
