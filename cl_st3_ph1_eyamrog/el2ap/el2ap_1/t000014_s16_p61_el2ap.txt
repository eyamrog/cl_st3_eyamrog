To conclude this section, the two documentation projects presented here
have enabled the creation of Paresi and Enenawe Nawe archival
collections, which are available both to the academic community and
to indigenous community members. In the context of the Covid-19
virus pandemic, archival collections such as these have been particularly
useful for researchers who were unable to visit indigenous communities.
Importantly, these collections are also a way of safeguarding traditional
knowledge, as has been made even more urgent through the
loss of many indigenous elders during the Covid-19 pandemic. It
is crucial that language documentation materials that have not yet
been deposited in archives be archived to ensure their long-term
preservation. An important next step is to make these collections
increasingly accessible to indigenous peoples in Brazil. In this way,
indigenous teachers will be able to use the materials in
community classrooms and for academic work within indigenous colleges.
