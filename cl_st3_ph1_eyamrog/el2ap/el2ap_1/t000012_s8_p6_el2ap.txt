Here, we used cleaning interactions among birds and mammals as
a study system to explore the role of opportunism and
specialized lifestyles in structuring ecological networks. Cleaning interactions are ecological
interactions that involve clients and cleaners and occur in a
number of marine and terrestrial ecosystems. In terrestrial systems, a
number of bird species engage in cleaning interactions of mammalian
herbivores. There is a remarkable diversity of birds that show
this behavior, all around the globe (e.g. Ruggiero and Ewes
1988, Sazima 2007a). The cleaners (birds) benefit from the hosts
(large mammals) by feeding on parasites, injured tissue or blood
(Ivan Sazima 2011). These interactions often provide benefits for the
cleaner individual, but the effects on clients are variable, including
negative, neutral, and positive effects. In the large majority of
cases, cleaning behavior is facultative for birds. Having said that,
some bird species, such as several caracaras (Falconidae) and some
tyranid birds, show a number of stereotyped behaviors associated with
cleaning. Moreover, in African savannahs, oxpeckers (Buphagus spp.) are highly
specialized cleaners that obtain most of their feeding resources from
these interactions. Thus, cleaning interactions show variability in the degree
of opportunism and specialization and we used this variation to
ask questions about the relative role of opportunism in shaping
these interactions.
