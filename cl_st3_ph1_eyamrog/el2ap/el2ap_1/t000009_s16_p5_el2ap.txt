Phase 1 aimed at raising the profile of those scientists.
Phase 2 was divided into two parts, each having a
different objective: investigating the ability of the participants to produce
publishable research articles in high-impact journals (Part 1); and deepening
the discussion about some contextual factors investigated in the questionnaire
(Part 2). Finally, ending the investigation, Phase 3 focused on
the analysis of reviews received by the authors about submitted
papers to computer science journals.3
