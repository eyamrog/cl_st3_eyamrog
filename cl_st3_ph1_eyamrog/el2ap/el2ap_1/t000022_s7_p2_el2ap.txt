The global report on diamond journals (Bosman et al. 2021)
recently published by OPERAS shows the importance of journals that
do not charge for publishing or for reading, and points
to the role of Latin America in the production of
25% of the total of these publications worldwide. Indeed, these
open access journals are mostly published by universities and managed
by full-time professors, assisted by technical support teams centralized in
the libraries. An important aspect in the consolidation of university
publishing in this region is the massive adoption of the
open source Open Journal System (OJS-PKP) for the management of
the editing, peer review and publication of the journals2. In
addition to university journals, there are also those of the
scientific societies and professional associations which are often operated with
the support of university infrastructure and personnel for digitization, creating
permalinks, acquiring DOIâ€™s, and doing the XML markup of the
texts. Although this support needs to be strengthened, this core
institutional and governmental support explains the existence and growth of
Latin American and Caribbean journals.
