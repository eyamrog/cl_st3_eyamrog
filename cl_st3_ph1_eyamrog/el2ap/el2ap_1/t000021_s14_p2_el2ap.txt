The focus groups were conducted in four phases (Figure 1):
I) presentation of the research focus and signing of the
Informed Consent Form; II) presentation of the demands of emotional
work identified and organized into three categories: a) interactional demands
arising from relationships with students, colleagues, and managers; b) technical-pedagogical,
related to the teaching practice itself and; c) intrapersonal, as
a result of internal conflicts, dissonances, etc. (MORAIS; GONDIM; PALMA,
2020); III) presentation of the guiding questions involving which emotions
are activated by specific emotional demands and how teachers deal
with these emotional demands, and IV) moment of group discussion
in search of consensus, disagreement, and deepening of the topic.
Each emotional demand (e.g., interactional, technical-pedagogical, and intrapersonal) was discussed
individually, and the guiding questions were presented sequentially.
