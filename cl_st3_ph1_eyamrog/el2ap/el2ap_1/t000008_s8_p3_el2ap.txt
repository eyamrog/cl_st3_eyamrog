Knowledge of seed biology, such as dormancy, germination, and storage,
is crucial to aid efforts to improve seed conservation techniques
(Ellis et al. 2007, Hay & Probert 2013, Costa et
al. 2017) and to use for restoration programs (Merritt &
Dixon 2011, Le√≥n-Lobos et al. 2012, Kildisheva et al. 2016,
Vittis et al. 2020). Therefore, to conserve seeds of a
species safely is necessary to assess germination requirements and the
category of seed storage behavior to find out the most
satisfactory storage environment and the duration of successful storage (Hong
& Ellis 1996, Teixido et al. 2017). Unfortunately, data on
seed dormancy and longevity and storage behavior have been neglected
for several wild native species in Brazil (Ribeiro et al.
2016). Such studies have also been limited to a relatively
small number of palm species (Jagannathan 2021).
