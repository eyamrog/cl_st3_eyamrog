To determine the languages of publication for the JUOJS, we
ran Google’s Compact Language Detector v3 (gcld3) on the 100
most recent articles in the ISSN-verified subset of JUOJS. Gcld3
is a freely available pre-trained neural classifier and has a
built-in flag for language predictions that indicates when the predicted
language classification exceeds an optimal probability threshold. Only reliable language
classifications were retained for each journal. Then, the most frequent
language classification for each journal was designated as the journal’s
primary language of publishing. If gcld3 classified a given journal’s
article abstracts as being in multiple languages (i.e., with at
least 5 articles per language), then the journal was designated
as multilingual. Finally, a variety of heuristic checks were applied
to verify the primary language of publishing for each journal,
for example, by checking predicted languages against top-level domains, which
resulted in the semi-manual correction of 478 journals. Two relatively
under-resourced languages, Balochi and Faroese, are currently unsupported by gcld3
and were instead discovered by searching top-level domains.
