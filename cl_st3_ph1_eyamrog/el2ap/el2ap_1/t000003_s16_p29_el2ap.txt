Colour was used symbolically in other ways too: in the
design of the football shirts, the jackets and even the
ribbons for the medals and the cups â€“ all incorporated
the red, yellow, black and white of the national flag.
FC Lao Rai United had also commissioned the weaving of
a traditional Timorese tais in yellow, black and white with
the name of the club incorporated into it. We had
two tais placed around our necks, at the end of
our interview with members of the club. This is a
formal Timorese gesture of thanks. One of these tais is
shown in Figure 2 below.
