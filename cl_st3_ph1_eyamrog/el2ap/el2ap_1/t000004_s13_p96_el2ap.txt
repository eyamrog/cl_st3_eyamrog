Just like spoken conversation is characterized by a certain tone,
the same can be said about a game of capoeira.
The way the game is played depends on different factors,
such as occasion or personality of the players. A friendly
game at the end of a class will be different
from a game played in a roda where people may
want to impress students from different schools. During public performances,
there is usually a focus on non-conflictive playfulness and acrobatics.
As pointed out above the tone and pace is throughout
set by the music.
