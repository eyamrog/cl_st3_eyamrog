In this sense, Bahia, Freire, Amaral, and Estrela (2013) and
Taxer and Frenzel (2015) claim that teachers' emotional lives encompass
a great variety of genuinely expressed or regulated emotions. However,
studies have focused mainly on a few self-regulation strategies, especially
cognitive reappraisal and suppression (TAXER; GROSS, 2018). Furthermore, these investigations
are generally decontextualized and cannot capture regulation as it occurs
in the classroom (e.g., CHANG, 2013; UITTO et al., 2015),
which might lead to superficial and hasty conclusions (GROSS, 2014).
In this regard, it is noteworthy to investigate how the
context can influence teachers' emotional experiences and their selection of
regulatory strategies because most studies focus on an intrapersonal perspective,
thus neglecting interpersonal and situational aspects (ENGLISH; LEE; JOHN; GROSS,
2017; FRIED et al., 2015; UITTO et al., 2015).
