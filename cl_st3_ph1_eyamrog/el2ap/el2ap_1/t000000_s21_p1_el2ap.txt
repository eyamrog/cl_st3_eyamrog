Dennstaedtiaceae, Lindsaeaceae, and Saccolomataceae, presented a total of four genera
and six species occurring in the region of Viçosa. Four
of those species have also infra-specific classifications, which were adopted
here. The six taxa are: Dennstaedtia cicutaria (Sw.) T. Moore,
and Pteridium esculentum subsp. arachnoideum (Kaulf.) J.A. Thomson (Dennstaedtiaceae); Lindsaea
lancea (L.) Bedd. var. lancea, L. quadrangularis Raddi subsp. quadrangularis,
and L. stricta (Sw.) Dryand. var. stricta (Lindsaeaceae); and Saccoloma
elegans Kaulf. Among them, only L. quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis and
S. elegans are endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest; the
remaining taxa are widespread in the Neotropics. Differently from the
other studied families: Salviniaceae (Miranda & Schwartsburd 2016); Anemiaceae (Rabelo
& Schwartsburd 2016); Polypodicaeae (Gonçalves da Silva & Schwartsburd 2017),
we have not recollected half of the taxa involved in
this paper, which were collected on the 1930s and never
again. Probably, they went locally extinct due to forest fragmentation
and disturbance. We have not recollected D. cicutaria, L. lancea
var. lancea, nor L. quandrangularis subsp. quadrangularis.
