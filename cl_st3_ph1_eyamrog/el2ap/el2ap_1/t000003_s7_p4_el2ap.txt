The orienting theories for our research come from the field
of multilingualism, from the sociolinguistics of globalization, from anthropological research
on migration and diaspora and from recent writing by sociologists
about mobilities and mooring. In the next section of this
paper, we touch on overlapping lines of theory-building in these
different fields and we foreground the concepts that are most
relevant to our research. In the third section, we trace
the broad temporal and spatial dimensions of transnational population movements
from Timor-Leste, focusing in on recent Timorese migration to Northern
Ireland. In the fourth section, we describe the research approach
adopted in our study and we detail the range of
ethnographic, textual and photographic data that we have gathered. In
the fifth section, we draw attention to the diverse origins
and migration trajectories of the participants in our study and
to the ways in which their communicative repertoires have been
shaped over time. In the sixth and most detailed section,
we describe the local conditions of settlement and employment. The
seventh section then focuses in on the nine football clubs
and on the ways in which linguistic and semiotic resources
are drawn upon in the naming and organisation of the
clubs, and in their distinctive branding. We also show how
cultural resources and different funds of knowledge are drawn upon
by club organisers and managers in the organisation of the
clubs. In addition, we point to the complex processes of
identification at work in this sports context, and to the
multifaceted local ways of representing what counts as being Timorese.
Then, in the two final sections, we offer reflections on
the significance of the insights we have gleaned from the
research that we have done thus far.
