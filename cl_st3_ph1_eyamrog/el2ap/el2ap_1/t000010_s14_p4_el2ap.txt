Luria Inicial neuropsychological battery: The instrument evaluates four domains of
cognition for children aged 4 to 6 years, these are:
executive, linguistic, speed and memory; as well as, a manual
lateralization test (Ramirez, et al., 2015). It is made up
of 14 tests that are grouped into executive domain (test
1 to 5: manual dexterity, right-left orientation, manual gestures and
orofacial praxis, verbal control of the motor act, reproduction of
visuospatial patterns). Linguistic domain (tests 6 to 10: visual perception
of objects and sets of drawings for naming, phonemic hearing,
vocabulary in images, reasoning by verbal analogy and numerical operations).
Processing speed domain (tests 11 and 12: rapid naming of
pictures and colors). Learning and memory domain (tests 13 and
14: verbal memory and visual memory). Manual laterality (preference, speed
and manual recognition) in order to know the state of
specialization of the cerebral hemispheres. In the proposed research, the
Cuban regulations were used (Ram√≠rez, et al., 2015).
