The impact of the appearance of Redalyc in 2005 can
be noted for all countries, especially for Mexico and Colombia.
The latter showed a very sustained growth in the number
of journals in the following decade, eventually surpassing Mexico which
experienced a slight stagnation in the number of journals. Argentina,
Venezuela, and Cuba follow a similar pattern with two sudden
expansions. However, the increase in subsequent years is moderate compared
to the other cases. More specifically, for journals published in
Cuba, there is an upward trend between 2005 and 2015,
followed by a decline. A decrease in the number of
journals indexed in Venezuela can be observed beginning in 2009
and, more rapidly, since 2014. Finally, the case of Chile
is also distinct with a sustained tendency, where 2005 did
not imply a sudden change in the growth trend of
the journals.
