Research data from the Internet Steering Committee in Brazil in
2019 showed that 64% of Brazilian public schools have computer
labs and 57% have access to the Internet (CGI.br, 2019b).
However, this access has been limited to the administrative sectors
of the schools and many laboratories have been abandoned due
to the lack of investments in technical maintenance and adequate
human resources. Thus, the devices and internet access that exist
in schools are not available to students in more than
70% of the schools that have them. Only 34% of
public schools were able to update their equipment in the
period from 2015 to 2018 (CGI.br, 2018a, 2018b, 2019b), as
they do not receive regular investments to keep computer labs,
mobile devices and even the Internet functioning.
