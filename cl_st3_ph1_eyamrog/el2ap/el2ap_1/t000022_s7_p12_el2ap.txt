In view of all this, we opted for a process
of revision of the journals through a manual and meticulous
procedure. First, the journals only in SciELO or only in
Redalyc were identified, and the metadata of these documents were
aggregated including articles, reviews, and editorials - both from active
journals at the time of capture as well as documents
indexed at an earlier time in between the gaps. in
coverage. As for the journals common to both indexing platforms,
the same journal could have different gaps or periods of
coverage in each of the platforms. Thus, the consistency and
completeness of the data were compared and, for each case,
it was decided to keep those that had the widest
temporal coverage and the largest number of documents. It should
be clarified that in this phase of the project, we
worked only with journals published in Latin America and the
Caribbean5.
