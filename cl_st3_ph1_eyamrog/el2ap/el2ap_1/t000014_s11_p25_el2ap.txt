Finally, as this section has explored, it is essential when
archiving language documentation materials to choose a repository that will
ensure their long-term preservation and accessibility. Many archives with the
necessary infrastructure, including many of those in the DELAMAN consortium,
serve an international community, and should not be viewed as
proprietary with respect to whatever country might host them. Nonetheless,
archiving initiatives are valuable at all levels – local, regional,
national, and international. In some cases, it may be advisable
to archive materials in more than one location, in order
to meet local priorities while also leveraging higher-level infrastructure that
offers the most reliable preservation and access (see §3.2 and
§6 below).
