The economic distribution of JUOJS was analyzed using the four
World Bank income groups (Figure 4). By gross national income
(GNI) per capita, 81.1% of the JUOJS are found in
the World Bankâ€™s middle income countries, with the 27 low
income countries accounting for only 53 JUOJS (0.2%). This amounts
to 81.6% of the journals coming from countries associated, by
national income, with the Global South (Haug, 2021). From a
geopolitical perspective, using the five United Nations Regional Groups, 78.1%
of the JUOJS are located in three UN regional groups
associated with Global South (Dados & Connell, 2012): Asia-Pacific States
(54.7%), Latin American and Caribbean States (21%), and African States
(2.4%) (Figure 5).
