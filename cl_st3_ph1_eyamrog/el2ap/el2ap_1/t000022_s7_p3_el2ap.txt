The vibrancy of this regional circuit is now more visible
globally given that the flow of scholarly communication has been
improved by several mega indexes such as Google Scholar, Dimensions,
Lens and the federation of repositories LA Referencia which has
a greater coverage of Latin American and Caribbean production. However,
there is still no significant impact of these journals on
global S&T reports or on evaluations of scientific careers, projects
and institutions in which the use of the Impact Factor
and other indicators from traditional databases such as the Web
of Science and Scopus continue to prevail. This prejudices the
value of the journals indexed in the region because it
drives many research groups to preferentially choose journals managed by
the dominant players in the publishing industry. This choice has
been historically shaped in the academic community by the deeply
rooted belief of the relevance/transparency of these indicators (Martinovich, 2020).
It also highlights the gap between the ability of the
region to, on the one hand, produce and publish quality
science and, on the other, to gain international legitimacy for
its journals (Packer and Meneghini, 2007). Several studies have already
pointed out the limitations of these traditional indicators which were
favored by several structural conditions and generated a series of
abuses and distortions that affected the creativity and even the
researchers' concern for the social relevance of science (Guédon, 2011;
Gingras, 2016; Ráfols, 2019). Thus, policies of internationalization that are
justified by the need to advance in the rankings result
in many institutions having their autonomy restricted and a weakening
of their own capacities to link with the research environment.
