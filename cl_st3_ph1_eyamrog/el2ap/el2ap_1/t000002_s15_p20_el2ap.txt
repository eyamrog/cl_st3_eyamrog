It is worth noting that these findings on classroom interaction
were obtained without presenting any discursive extract to the reader.
In some cases, researchers present just a small extract to
illustrate the scheme application and not as part of the
analysis itself. Thus, the result is totally based on the
explanatory power of the codes and on the reliability of
the coding process. Moreover, considering the nature of the questions,
it is clear that a qualitative approach would neither offer
the generalisation for the description nor objectivism to compare the
change in the discursive variables over time.
