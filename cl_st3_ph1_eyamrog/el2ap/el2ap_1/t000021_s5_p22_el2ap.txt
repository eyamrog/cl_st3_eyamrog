Contradictorily, strategies such as excessive worry, identification of flaws, and
self-blame, all related to psychological disorders (NELIS et al., 2011)
were most often cited by more experienced teachers in the
basic area. As these teachers were also the ones who
most mentioned active coping and approaching attitude, a possible explanation
is that the high frequency and intensity of interaction with
students requires considerable emotional work, leading to exhaustion throughout their
careers (YIN et al., 2017). Another assumption is that excessive
emotional work, unsuccessful attempts, and misdirected effort (usually through trial
and error) can overload and undermine emotional and cognitive resources
causing teachers to reevaluate their professional competence and self-image negatively.
Although exposure to emotional events seems beneficial because it expands
the emotional repertoire (ALDAO et al., 2015), it can also
be harmful throughout the career if not properly directed and
channeled.
