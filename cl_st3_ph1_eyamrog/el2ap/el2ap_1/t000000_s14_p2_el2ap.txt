We have been sampling the remnant forest patches since 2012.
Specimens were collected and dried according to usual methods for
fern collections (Windisch 1992) and then incorporated in herbarium VIC
(acronyms following Thiers, continuously updated), with duplicates to be sent
to other herbaria. We also fully reviewed the collection of
herbarium VIC and collections of other herbaria online: F, IAN,
NY, PH, RB, U, UC, UPCB, US, and WTU. Although
the classification system adopted for the previous fascicles was based
on an adaptation of Kenrick & Crane (1997) and Smith
et al. (2006), we here adopt the system of PPG
I (2016). Morphological terms are according to Lellinger (2002).
