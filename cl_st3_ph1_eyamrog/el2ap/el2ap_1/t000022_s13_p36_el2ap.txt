In the other countries, although the evolution over these ten
years could also be characterized by a decrease in the
relative weight of Spanish in favor of English, the latter
never overtook the former. There is also an important segmentation
by discipline. In the journals in Agricultural Sciences, Engineering and
Technologies and Natural and Exact Sciences considered as a whole,
English went from representing 29% of the articles in 2009
to 42% in 2018. At the same time, Spanish dropped
from 70% to 57% of the articles. In other words,
the official language of most Latin American countries remained the
predominant language of the articles.
