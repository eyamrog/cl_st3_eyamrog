Much research has focused on the role of language and
discursive interaction in the knowledge-building process in classroom-based settings (Howe
& Mercer, 2007; Mercer et al., 2020; Resnick et al.,
2015; Schwarz & Baker, 2016). In the last 40 years,
this research field has flourished under umbrella terms such as
‘classroom dialogue’ or ‘dialogic teaching’ (Kim & Wilkinson, 2019; Mercer
& Dawes, 2014), encapsulating studies that aim to effectively use
discursive interactions in the teaching context (Alexander, 2008). This stance
in the educational field has been called ‘dialogic turn’, emphasising
students’ voice, agency, and participation in the co-construction of knowledge
(Wilkinson & Son, 2011).
