Based on Sazima et al. 2012 and Mikula et al.
2017, we reconstructed the networks of cleaning interactions of Brazil
(Pantanal) and Africa, using a heat map to identify the
diet diversity index of each bird species (Fig. 4). Also,
the size of nodes represents the centrality degree of these
networks (bigger nodes represent bird species that interact with a
higher diversity of host species).
