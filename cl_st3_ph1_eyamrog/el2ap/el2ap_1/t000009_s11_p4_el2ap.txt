Needs analysis is the process through which ESP practitioners investigate
specificity in the target and present situation (Songhori, 2008). This
process materializes praxis, the second main principle of the approach.
Kumaravadivelu (2001) calls it practicality and explains that when analyzing
the specificities of the discourse to be taught and the
specificities of the classroom, teachers assume the role of scientists,
whose theories become the basis of their own teaching. Since
the preliminary work of Swales (1990) in ESP, both principles
have oriented ESP practice in occupational (EOP – English for
occupational purposes) and academic (EAP – English for academic purposes)
settings.
