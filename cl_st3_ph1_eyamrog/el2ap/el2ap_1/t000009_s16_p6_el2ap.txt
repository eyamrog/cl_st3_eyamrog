Out of the 6.086 research articles published from 2011 to
2016 in the seven journals investigated, 67 were written by
or in collaboration with 127 Brazilian researchers. Table 2 presents
the number of papers published by each journal in the
considered period and the number of Brazilian researchers who produced
them. When there was no contact information of the authors
available in the published article, the Google web search engine
was used to look up their profiles in a Brazilian
database for researchers and institutions (Lattes)4. An e- mail was
then sent to each author, inviting him/her to participate in
the research through answering an online questionnaire on Google Docs.
The link to the questionnaire was added to the e-mail.5
