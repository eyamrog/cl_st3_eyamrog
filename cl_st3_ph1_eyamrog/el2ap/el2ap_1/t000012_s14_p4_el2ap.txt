We analyzed the centrality degree of the Brazilian and African
networks (Sazima et al. 2012; Mikula et al. 2017) by
computing the number of host species that the cleaners species
were interacting. We focused on degree measure, where the nodes
(i.e species) that have more diverse interactions, represent the central
nodes. Then we compared the centrality degree of each bird
species with their H value, using a regression analysis. Our
prediction was that the bird species that interact with many
different hosts (i.e. more links with different mammal species) would
be the birds with a higher H, meaning a positive
correlation between these two measures (Fig 2). The details of
hosts species and H of each bird species can be
accessed in Supplementary fig. 2.
