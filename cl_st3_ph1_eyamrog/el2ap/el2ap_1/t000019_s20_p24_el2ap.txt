As for knowledge about DICT, it is worth stating that
the lack of this knowledge affects the general population, including
teachers and students. When analyzing classes A and B, it
is observed that, at least 90% of people have a
working knowledge of IT (CGI.br, 2019a). However, among the lower
classes, this is not true, as this type of education
does not yet exist in the public school, where most
of them study or studied. Neither are they able to
pursue private courses due to financial and working conditions. When
questioned, about the reason they do not know basic informatics,
people from classes D and E stated that it is
due to the costs involved (CGI.br, 2019a, 2018a).
