It is in front of the orchestra, ao pé do
berimbau, that each game of capoeira starts and finishes. Two
capoeiristas, usually the two people sitting nearest to the orchestra
(that is, at the ends of the semi-circle formed by
the people who participate in the roda but do not
play in the orchestra), come closer to each other and
squat down in front of the gunga, which is one
of the three berimbaus normally used in the orchestra and
played by the person leading the roda, and wait for
their signal to start the game. The game generally follows
the attack-dodge dynamic and the attacks usually have the form
of non-contact kicks. Head-butts are also popular and highly acclaimed,
while hand strikes are used rarely. The distinction between an
attack and a defence is not always clear – while
moving away from an attack, for example, a player may
at the same time perform a rasteira (a sweep). This
ambiguity lies at the core of malandragem, or trickiness, which
consists in confusing the opponent by simulating a move and
doing something else instead. Through the choice of their techniques,
the players try to get each other into the position
of disadvantage or to make them expose a vulnerable part
of their body. The attack-defence dynamic of the game may
be occasionally interrupted by ritualistic performances such as chamada or
volta ao mundo or short spontaneous dancing or dramatic performances,
often humorous.
