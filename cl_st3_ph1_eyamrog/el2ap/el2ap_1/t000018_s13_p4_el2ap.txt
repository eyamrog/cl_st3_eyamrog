The articles reviewed in Table 1 use the information to
obtain a profile of weaknesses and strengths in the child's
development, and on that basis diagnose and suggest stimulation. However,
the authors' intention is reduced to the analysis of the
child, and the assessment of the group, where the learner
plays and receives developmental influences, is deficient. In addition, the
evaluation is based on the results of the tasks applied
and the systematic analysis with the criteria of the family
and other educational agents and agencies is insufficient.
