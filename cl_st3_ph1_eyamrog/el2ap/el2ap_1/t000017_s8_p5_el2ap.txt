According to these requirements, some authors have developed and validated
instruments for preschool children in low- and middle-income Latin American
countries (Bornstein et al., 2015). In Argentina, the CHEXI (Childhood
Executive Functioning Inventory) was developed (Gutiérrez et al., 2021), in
Chile the TENI (Test de Evaluación Neuropsicológica Infantil) (Tenorio et
al., 2014), and in Mexico the ENI (Evaluación neuropsicológica infantil)
(Matute et al., 2007) and the BANFE (Batería de funciones
ejecutivas y lóbulos frontal) (Flores et al., 2012). In Cuba,
Ramírez et al. (2013) worked with the Luria Inicial neuropsychological
battery to assess the development of preschool children, and although
it showed adequate values of validity and reliability, it has
limitations to be applied in the educational context: the application
is long and complex and educators do not have the
time to train and assess children in their classrooms.
