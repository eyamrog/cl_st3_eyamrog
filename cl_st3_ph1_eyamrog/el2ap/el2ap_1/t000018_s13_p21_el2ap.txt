- The tests proposed by Luria in the 20th century
can be adapted in preschool childhood to assess motor skills,
language, memory, lateralization of functions and thinking.(30, 31) For example,
Luria used, as an evaluation task, the learning of 10
words in 5 trials to assess the psychophysiological functioning of
the temporal lobe and its connection with subcortical structures; however,
in education it can be used to assess the development
of the child's memory and its ability to learn a
song, to remember the name of objects and verbal commands,
as well as to follow a route of actions outlined
by the educator to meet a goal.
