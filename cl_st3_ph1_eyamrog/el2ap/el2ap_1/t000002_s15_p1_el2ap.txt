First of all, analysing discursive interaction is an inherently subjective
exercise of building meaning from the thoughts and voices of
others, which are constrained and affected by social, cultural, and
situated contexts. Such analytical process involves a great deal of
interpretation as it relates to reflexivity; researchers bring their own
preconceptions, interests, biases, agenda, and so on (Cohen et al.,
2007).
