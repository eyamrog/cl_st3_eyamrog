Considering the interpretivism nature of this analysis and the specificities
of the study (primary science, scientific discourse and evaporation), a
further framework was required during the data interrogation. Basically, it
was required to define 'what counts as an explanation in
classroom talk within primary science'. Very briefly, looking at the
data and theory reiteratively, two structural aspects was set: forms
of explanations and causation (Braaten & Windschitl, 2011). Thus, the
analysis would search for sequences of utterances that convey instances
of explanation (definitions, descriptions, and reasoning) and causation (cause-effect accounts
of an observable event). Finding examples of these occurrences might
make it possible to generate typologies, comment on and describe
them, and discuss potential outcomes.
