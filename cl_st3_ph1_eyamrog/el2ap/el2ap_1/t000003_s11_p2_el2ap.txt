By the first decade of the twenty first century, sociolinguists
began to make their own significant contributions to this emerging
body of research, through empirical work and theory building. They
contributed to the characterisation of the political, economic and cultural
conditions of late modernity and to the identification of the
ways in which language practices and ideologies organise and legitimise
these conditions (COUPLAND, 2003, HELLER, 2007, 2011, BLOMMAERT, 2010, DUCHÃŠNE;
HELLER, 2012, HELLER et al. 2016). Here, we focus in
on the specific epistemological shifts that have taken place in
the sociolinguistics of multilingualism and we show how the specific
debates in this field guided our own thinking as we
undertook this research with Timorese in the UK.
