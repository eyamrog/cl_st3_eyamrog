In his groundbreaking article that defined the field of language
documentation, Himmelmann (1998) includes archiving as one of the four
key steps in creating what he calls “a language documentation”
(p. 171); that is, a collection of transcribed and annotated
audiovisual recordings with their accompanying metadata. Metadata are the supporting
contextual, technical, and administrative documentation that helps to explain the
data, including any keys (e.g., codes, orthographies) needed to understand,
analyze, and reuse them (KUNG et al., 2020). Woodbury (2003)
calls such a collection of primary data and the associated
metadata a “corpus” and he includes archiving as one of
six criteria that establish the overall quality of a documentary
corpus.
