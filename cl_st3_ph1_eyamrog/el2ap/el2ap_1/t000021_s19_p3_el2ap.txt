The deductive and inductive analysis of the data allowed us
to arrive at the categorical system of teacher emotional regulation
illustrated in Figure 2. It is observed that the identified
emotional regulation strategies adequately adhered to the five strategy families
of the Process Model of Emotion Regulation. Table 2 presents
the definition of the strategies, their breaking down into tactics,
the (general) frequency of families and strategies, and the examples
that characterize them. Breaking down the strategies into tactics and
their detailed description helped characterize the emotional regulation in the
context investigated and to highlight its specificities. Furthermore, it allowed
groups comparison. We considered that a more general analysis would
make such findings difficult to reveal.
