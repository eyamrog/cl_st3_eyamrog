Argentina also has its own peculiarities. The fact that it
has the lowest share (56.4%) of articles published in its
journals with at least one author from Argentina suggests a
stronger trend to publish abroad than that observed for the
Chilean case. However, there are other explanations. There is evidence
that journals from Argentina are underrepresented in the OLIVA database,
a product of a traditional selection of social science and
humanities journals edited in that country by the services of
the Latindex catalog. This selection was driven, among other factors,
by the characteristics of the existing assessment culture at CONICET
(the National Science Council) and the national universities where publications
indexed in Latindex are rewarded at the same level as
those included in SciELO, Scopus and WoS (Beigel, 2014). To
this we can add the lower technical complexity of indexing
in the Latindex Catalog 2.0 compared to the requirements of
SciELO and Redalyc, and the clout of the national (Argentine)
node of Latindex. If we compare the journals of Brazil,
Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Colombia in the Latindex Catalog 2.0
with the OLIVA database, we see that in the case
of Chile there are 144 journals in OLIVA and 167
in the Latindex Catalog 2.0. In contrast, there are 316
Argentine journals in the Latindex Catalog 2.0 and 167 in
SciELO or Redalyc, that is, almost twice as many. In
contrast, the journals of Argentina in the OLIVA database that
do not belong to the social sciences and humanities are
mostly indexed in SciELO (43/69).
