While more than 70% of all interviewees believed they have
good/very good command of English to write academic papers, and
65% had already had some type of international academic experience,
the one in northern Brazil presented a bad evaluation of
his English academic writing and stated that he had never
had any type of international experiences. Such a difference may
be motivated by numerous reasons, including personal ones. Among them,
the unequal investments in education that the government makes in
different states of Brazil cannot be ignored.
