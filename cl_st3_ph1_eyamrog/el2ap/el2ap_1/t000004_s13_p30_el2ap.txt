One of the dance-like moves is the three step ginga,
performed to the rhythm of the music and shadowing the
other person. However, the constant movement of the ginga is
strategic, aiming to confuse the opponent, making it an ideal
base for an attack. Although the players are moving in
a synchronized way, mechanical following is not desirable in capoeira,
as it leads to predictability. Experienced players will break the
pattern of the ginga from time to time â€“ but
even then they do so rhythmically, in line with the
music.
