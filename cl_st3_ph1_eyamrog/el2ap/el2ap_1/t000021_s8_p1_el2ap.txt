The emotion regulation field has grown exponentially in terms of
theoretical and empirical work over the last 20 years (GROSS,
2015). However, only recently has it sparked interest in educational
research (TAXER; GROSS, 2018; YIN, 2016). Literature reviews on teachers'
emotions (e.g., FRIED; MANSFIELD; DOBOZY, 2015; UITTO; JOKIKOKKO; ESTOLA, 2015)
highlight the growing concern over emotion regulation as one of
the main topics of investigation, taking into account the high
levels of burnout and harm to teachers' well- being resulting,
in part, from processes associated with emotion dysregulation and emotional
demands (e.g., CHANG, 2013; YIN et al., 2016). Nevertheless, studies
have also pointed out that emotion regulation seems to enhance
professional performance (e.g., TAXER; FRENZEL, 2015), teachers' mental health, and
teacher-student interactions (e.g., CHANG; DAVIS, 2009; TAXER; FRENZEL, 2015; YIN,
2015).
