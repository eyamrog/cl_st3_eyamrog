The development of a global consensus on the need for
open access to scientific literature has brought increasing attention to
the region's journals and indexing systems. Basson et. al (2021)
analyze the proportion of open access articles available in Dimensions,
which by 2021 had 46.6% of its documents in open
access. They note that this percentage increases to 63.5% for
documents published by Latin American and Caribbean journals. There are
few studies that provide information, at the document level, on
the breadth and diversity of the production published in the
region, apart from the aforementioned mainstream databases. An important precedent
is the study by Miguel (2011) which compared the coverage
of journals from Latin America and the Caribbean included in
SciELO, Redalyc and SCOPUS for the period 2005-2009. The estimated
volume of scientific production using these three sources revealed differences
with respect to the coverage registered in the Latindex catalog3.
In relation to disciplinary coverage, SCOPUS and SciELO were more
thematically balanced, while Redalyc showed a greater inclination towards the
Social Sciences and Humanities.
