Genus Cosmarium is worldwide recorded in many taxonomic surveys. From
classical 19th century literature (e.g., Brébisson 1856, Lundell 1871, Nordstedt
& Wittrock 1876, Ralfs 1848, West & G.S. West 1895)
to the more recent papers, the genus was recorded for
many countries, including Nigeria (Biswas & Nweze 1990), Colombia (Duque
& Donato 1996), Canada (Elster et al. 1997), Bangladesh (Islam
& Irfanullah 2006), India (Dhande & Jawale 2009, Bansod &
Patil 2019), Czech Republic (Šťastný 2009), South Korea (Lee 2015)
and many others. Over 600 Cosmarium taxa were recorded for
Brazil (Biolo & Bicudo 2018), and the genus was more
intensively studied in the south region where numerous taxonomic studies
revealed its presence in both phytoplankton and periphyton of reservoirs
and rivers. Recent floristic studies recording the presence of Cosmarium
in Brazil include States such as Paraná (Silva & Cecy
2004, Bortolini et al. 2010, Felisberto & Rodrigues 2010, Biolo
et al. 2013, Menezes et al. 2011, Carvalho et al.
2015, Moresco et al. 2015, Aquino et al. 2016, Osório
et al. 2018, Rodrigues & Moresco 2021), São Paulo (Bicudo
et al. 2019, Felisberto & Rodrigues 2010), Bahia (Oliveira et
al. 2010, Oliveira et al. 2011, Oliveira et al. 2016,
Ramos et al. 2018, Ramos et al. 2021), Goiás (Felisberto
& Rodrigues 2004), Distrito Federal (Estrela et al. 2011), Amazonas
(Saturnino et al. 2020), Sergipe (Burle et al. 2020), Mato
Grosso and Rio de Janeiro (Kanetsuna 2004). Furthermore, in the
last 10 years five new species of Cosmarium were described
based on Brazilian material: Cosmarium bahianum G.J.P.Ramos, C.E.M.Bicudo & C.W.N.Moura,
Cosmarium bromelicola G.J.P.Ramos, C.E.M.Bicudo & C.W.N.Moura, Cosmarium diamantinum G.J.P.Ramos &
C.W.N.Moura, Cosmarium imperiale G.J.P.Ramos & C.W.N.Moura and Cosmarium oliveirae G.J.P.Ramos,
C.E.M.Bicudo & C.W.N.Moura, in addition to a few taxonomic varieties.
Despite having one of the most important coastal lake systems
of Brazil (Barroso et al. 2012), Espírito Santo State has
been widely neglected concerning its algal flora studies. Delazari-Barroso et
al. (2007) is the only floristic study of the State
recording the presence of the genus by four Cosmarium taxa
(Cosmarium asphaerosporum var. strigosum Nordstedt, Cosmarium cf. capitulum J.Roy &
Bisset, Cosmarium pseudobroomei Wolle and Cosmarium pseudoconnatum Nordstedt).
