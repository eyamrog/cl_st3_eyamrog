Surely, all paradigms can be applied and generate new knowledge
when analysing classroom interaction. For instance, the positivist approach demands
simplification of social practices to make research manageable; in general,
selecting a set of dialogue variables and controlling others one
related to learning outcomes (Asterhan et al., 2020). It is
such a method that allows us to state something about
how dialogic teaching affects students' learning. On the other side,
the interpretivist paradigm might provide a more nuanced frame on
the dynamics of dialogue through, for example, ethnographic case studies
that stretch the cultural context of the classroom setting (Asterhan
et al., 2020). However, as said above, different methods are
required for each paradigm when addressing research questions of different
natures. Ultimately, this is exactly the aim of this discussion
paper.
