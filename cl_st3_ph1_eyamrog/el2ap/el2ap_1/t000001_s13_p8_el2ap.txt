The goal of long-read assembly is to produce complete sequences
with no structural errors, i.e. the only errors in the
assembly should be small-scale, e.g. single-bp substitutions, insertions or deletions.
This is because later polishing steps can repair small-scale errors
but may not be able to fix larger structural errors.
