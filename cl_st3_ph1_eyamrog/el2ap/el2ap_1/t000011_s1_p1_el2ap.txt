(How dehydration affects stem bending stiffness and leaf toughness after
sampling of the liana Amphilophium crucigerum (L.) L.G.Lohmann (Bignoniaceae)). Lianas
are woody climbers and their stems and leaves deal with
different environmental pressures such as resistance to mechanical damage and
dehydration. The damage resistance of plants can be biomechanically evaluated
by their stiffness, bending and toughness. Despite the well-known relationship
between physical resistance and moisture of plant organs in woody
plants, this relationship is uncertain and has not been previously
evaluated in lianas. Thus, this study investigated experimentally the effect
of stems and leaf dehydration on the structural Young’s modulus
in the stem and fracture toughness in leaves across time
in the liana Amphilophium crucigerum (Bignoniaceae). Ten stem and leaf
samples were collected and assigned to two distinct conditions: (i)
samples kept moist and (ii) samples underwent gradual dehydration with
natural moisture loss by air exposition. Successive measures of structural
Young’s modulus and fracture toughness were taken every 4 hours
during a 48-hour period for both conditions. Stem and leaf
samples which underwent gradual dehydration showed greater bending stiffness and
fracture toughness, respectively, while the samples kept moist presented no
changes in any studied biomechanical features during the entire experiment.
We concluded that the moisture of both stem and leaf
samples are critical factors to estimate the biomechanical properties of
lianas stem and leaves.
