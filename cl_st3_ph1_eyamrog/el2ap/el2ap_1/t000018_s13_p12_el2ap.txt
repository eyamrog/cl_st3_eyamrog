To the question what to evaluate, Luria answers that the
defect or symptom underlying a brain injury, and that symptom
limits the functioning of mental processes as a whole and
is expressed in a syndrome. (16) Luria recognized the neuropsychological
factors of various syndromes to explain the mental processes affected
after brain injury, and defined the neuropsychological factor as a
link that integrates psychological systems, human activity, and brain functioning.
Such factors underlie a given action or activity and are
responsible for the defect in the face of brain injury.
