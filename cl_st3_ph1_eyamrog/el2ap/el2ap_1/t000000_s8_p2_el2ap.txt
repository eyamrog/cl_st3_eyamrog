Brazil is represented by Dennstaedtiaceae with eight genera and 26
species, Lindsaeaceae with one genus and 34 spp., Lonchitidaceae with
one genus and one sp., and Saccolomataceae with one genus
and nine spp., leaving Pteridaceae apart (which is subject to
another paper) (Kramer 1957, Pena et al. 2020, Schwartsburd 2020,
Schwartsburd & Pena 2020). In general, these plants present characters
considered plesiomorphic that are typical of the early-diverging lineages of
Polypodiales, such as solesnotelic rhizomes clothed with hairs or primitive
scales, large, highly dissected leaves, the sori that are truly
marginal and protected by inner and outer indusia, and trilete
spores (Tryon & Tryon 1982, Kramer 1990, PPG I 2016,
Schwartsburd et al. 2020).
