In this last section, a complementary data source is analyzed
for an in-depth characterization of the national collaboration in this
country. This is the metadata of articles published in the
journals of the SciELO Brazil collection over the five-year period
2016-2020, totaling 104,750 documents. This information was extracted from SciELO
in May 2021. This is the portion of the database
that has undergone the process of standardizing the names of
authors and their institutional affiliations, and allows for a more
precise analysis. This set of documents includes authors from 162
countries. In 74.5% of the cases, there are only authors
affiliated with Brazilian institutions (and 23.6% with only one author),
while in 18.3% of the cases there are only authors
from other countries. In just 7.1% of the documents is
there collaboration between authors inside and outside of Brazil. The
picture is therefore very similar to the one presented in
Figure 6. Notably, in these articles co-authored by Brazilians and
foreigners, only 17% are co- authored with Latin American countries.
This phenomenon, to a large extent determined by linguistic aspects,
is something that we have already commented on.
