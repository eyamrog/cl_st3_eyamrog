Clearly, the demand for language documentation archives is growing in
Brazil, as elsewhere, and is presently far above the current
capacity. One possible solution to the need for more capacity
is the creation of regional digital archives. These would not
only increase the current capacity, but they would also have
the advantage of relative proximity and visibility to the indigenous
peoples of the region. This could facilitate both further recording
and indigenous groups’ access to those recordings. A natural place
for archives of this type is indigenous training programs at
universities, for example at the Universidade de Amazonas, the Universidade
Federal de Goiás, or the Universidade Federal do Amapá in
Oiapoque. In these programs, indigenous students are trained in computer
literacy while maintaining contact with their respective groups, thus facilitating
a productive cooperation between the archive and the groups in
question. The infrastructure for an archive of this type can
be bought at once or, as in the case of
the Goeldi, built up, in stages, in tandem with research
or documentation projects. The cost of a 48TB NAS (Network
Attached Storage) was approximately R$20,000 in the middle of 2021
(with the dollar at R$5.80). For digital language documentation, a
complete set of excellent portable semi-professional equipment (camcorder, tripod, digital
audio recorder, laptop, three types of microphones, lamp, carrying case,
batteries, cords, adapters) was approximately R$20,000. At least two kits
would be needed to equip a regional documentation center and
archive. In addition to infrastructure, training in documentation technology and
methodology is required to ensure quality, which is always a
challenge. One issue to be resolved is the need for
an archiving software that is reasonably simple and user-friendly.
