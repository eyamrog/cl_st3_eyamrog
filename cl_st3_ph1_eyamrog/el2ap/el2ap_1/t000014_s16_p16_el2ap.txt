However, the vast majority of archival projects involve at least
some speakers who do not interact directly with the archive,
and in many cases may not have prior familiarity with
archiving or what it entails. The “Kawahiva Language Documentation Archive”
(DOS SANTOS, 2017+) is one example; this collection, developed on
an ongoing basis, consists of audio and video recordings of
stories, conversations, songs, elicitation, meetings, field notes, and photographs. Two
speakers record, transcribe, and send files monthly for archiving, “creat[ing]
the sentiment that the archive belongs to them as well”
(DOS SANTOS, p.c.), and depositor Wesley dos Santos has also
created a video to explain to community members how to
access the materials via the California Language Archive.
