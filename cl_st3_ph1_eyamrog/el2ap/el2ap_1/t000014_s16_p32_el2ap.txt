As the Mako case illustrates, having and maintaining access to
language documentation materials tends to be a key priority for
communities, not only for those people who are directly involved
in documentation, but also – and sometimes even more so
– for their descendants (e.g., DWYER, 2006, p. 59; VAPNARSKY,
2020; R. MILLER, 2021). Yet effectively returning language documentation materials
to communities can be a complex and multi-stage process, and
must take into account the different capacities community members have
to access these materials. These capacities may be constrained not
only by a lack of access to the internet, through
which archived materials in many digital repositories can be viewed
and downloaded, but also by the skills required for navigating
online interfaces (as well as the languages in which these
interfaces might be presented, such as English) and by basic
computer literacy. For members of some communities, access even to
static technologies such as CD and DVD players may be
limited, as may be the capacity to read printed materials
in the community language (or otherwise).
