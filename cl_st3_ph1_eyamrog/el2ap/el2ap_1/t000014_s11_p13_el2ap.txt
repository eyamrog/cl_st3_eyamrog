While there are digital repositories that claim to be purely
open access, all digital language archives have rules for how
users may interact with the holdings, and most digital language
archives have graded access, by which certain materials may be
restricted to particular users and/or conditions of use (see also
§2.5). Regarding the rules of use, all digital language archives
have some sort of terms or conditions that the online
visitors must agree to before they can access the media
files. Many digital archives require a user to create a
free account and log in before they can access the
media files. However, the catalog information (i.e., the metadata) is
usually publicly accessible, meaning that anyone who lands on the
archive’s web page can access and read it. Most language
archives have some form of graded access to media files,
though the way graded access works varies greatly between archives.
AILLA uses numbered levels that indicate grades of access; other
archives have specialized user roles and some use color coding
to indicate who can access specific materials.
