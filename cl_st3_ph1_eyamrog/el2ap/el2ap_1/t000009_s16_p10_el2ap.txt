Among the participants, there were Brazilian computer scientists from four
regions of the country and researchers who were then abroad.
Considering that Brazilian computer science graduate students need English to
share their research results with their peers around the globe,
and because the target audience of the considered online CEAP
course was students from around Brazil, the conduction of this
global investigation of the target discourse community responded to this
contextual specificity. Those different backgrounds have led to distinct experiences
with academic publication among the researchers, which were deeply investigated
in Phase 2, and will be discussed below.
