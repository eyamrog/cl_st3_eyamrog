Brazilian experts who have published articles in the higher ranked
journals in each of seven subfields in computer science, according
to the Journal Citation Reports2 (JCR), over a five- year
period were invited to take part in this investigation. Differently
from CEAP courses that take place in English-speaking countries or
in countries where instruction is in English, the target situation
here does not emerge from the interactions of a local
community, but rather from a global one engaged in the
process of academic publication in computer science. Investigating the contextual
features of this target situation in person would be extremely
time- and resource-consuming. Thus, as a viable alternative, ICT was
used for both data gathering and analysis at a distance.
Table 1 presents the ICT tools used in each of
the three phases of the contextual TSA.
