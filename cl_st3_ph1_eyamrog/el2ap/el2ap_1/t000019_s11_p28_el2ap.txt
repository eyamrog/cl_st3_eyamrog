An omission by educators in relation to the social demands
posed by the new paradigm of the productive process would
tend to be detrimental to the interests of the excluded
social sectors. The resistance to a widespread diffusion of new
information and communication technologies, in public schools under the argument
that they are inserted in the logic of the market
and cultural globalization, would have the effect of more exclusion
and more social selectivity. This is due to their non-
integration with the teaching practices and would impede opportunities for
students to receive and divulge information, leaving them unattended in
the face of the onslaught of cultural and political manipulation
[...] It is not fair, therefore, that alongside the intensification
of the production and dissemination of information, a large contingent
of the population should be excluded as a result of
this process. (Lib√¢neo, 2011, p. 61).
