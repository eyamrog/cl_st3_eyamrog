Another very common conception of technology, more associated with postmodernism,
is the deterministic-technological one. According to this interpretation, technology is
not only understood as neutral, but also as something that
“controls humans, that is, it shapes society to the demands
of efficiency and progress” (Feenberg, 2003, p. 7). Here we
see statements that technologies solve all kinds of problems, without
considering their socio-historical roots.
