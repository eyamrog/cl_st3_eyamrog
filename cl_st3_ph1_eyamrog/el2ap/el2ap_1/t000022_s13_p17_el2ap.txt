The sustainability of diamond access journals is a contested issue.
The recently published OPERAS report highlights the importance of this
model and it estimates the existence of 29,000 diamond access
journals worldwide. It also points out their largely weak management
as a generalized feature of these journals and suggests the
adoption of a new business model (Bosman et al. 2021).
The journals in SciELO and Redalyc that we have been
describing – the vast majority of which do not charge
for reading or publishing – demonstrate just the opposite: that
they are not merely volunteer enterprises. In Latin America there
is considerable consensus about the need for national and institutional
policies to sustain the management and regularity of the journals,
but also a strong consensus that the solution does not
lie in the adoption of the APC model (Babini and
Debat, 2020). There is also a legitimate concern that the
APC opens a floodgate to predatory journals and commercialization (Córdoba
González, 2021).
