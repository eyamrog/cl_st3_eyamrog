The storage period reduced the germination performance of the study
species. The germination percentage of stored pyrenes decreased to â‰¤50%
(Figure 2 b). Germination times varied from 18 to 33
days in freshly harvested, and around 18 days in the
stored pyrenes (Figure 2 c, d). Speed index followed the
same patterns of G% (Figure 2 e, f). This germination
parameter can be used as a tool to evaluate the
rate of germinated seeds/pyrenes (or emerged seedlings) per day, also
applied as a metric for seedling vigor (Maguire 1962, Ranal
& Santana 2006). The initial water content of the stored
pyrenes decreased to 7% after the one-year period of storage.
This study demonstrated that stored seeds of Copernicia alba Morong
species from the Pantanal wetland, even though the germination capacity
was reduced over time, can remain relatively viable and germinable
at least over the time frame of this study for
one year. However, these results showed a limitation of using
only germination studies to assess viability. Viability tests such as
tetrazolium and X-ray tests are widely used in conservation programs
(Terry et al. 2003, Gosling 2004, Riebkes et al. 2015)
and could have been applied to evaluate whether the non-germinated
stored seeds remained viable or undergone some kind of secondary
dormancy state (Schlindwein et al. 2019). Future studies should assess
viability through these methods and test different storage conditions to
maintain higher germinability of the seeds of the study species.
