The approach we take here is rather different, based on
our research rather than curriculum driven in that it starts
with ethnographic research into capoeira, drawing on participant observation, audio
and video recordings, an approach often called linguistic ethnography (cf.
SNELL; COPLAND; SHAW, 2015). As suggested above, we have also
taken a translanguaging approach (BAYNHAM; LEE, 2018), drawing out the
different communication modalities that make up the capoeira spatial repertoire:
verbal, gestural, embodied, musical and examining how they work together
at different stages of the session. So in taking a
translanguaging approach we are affirming that named/ nameable language such
as Portuguese or English are only one strand in the
modalities that come together in capoeira practice. Indeed Sandro has
additionally reminded us of the presence of African elements in
each modality, including from languages such as Yoruba, further enriching
the distinctively Afro-Brazilian synthesis.
