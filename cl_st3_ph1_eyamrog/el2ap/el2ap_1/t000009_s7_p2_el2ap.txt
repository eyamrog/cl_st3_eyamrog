The advent of new technologies, or ICT (information and communication
technologies), in the turn of the century, has drastically changed
innumerous social systems (Warschauer, 2002), including that of education. The
inclusion of ICT in the teaching and learning processes has
affected educational systems around the globe differently, causing, in the
first moments, chaos and instability. Hara and Kling (2000), for
instance, approached the influences of ICT on students, showing that
lack of prompt feedback and technical problems were two reasons
for students’ frustration in a web-based, distance language course in
the United States. As far as the teachers/instructors are concerned,
Lam (2000) showed that the 10 language teachers interviewed in
Canada about their use of ICT in their classes believed
that the perceived limitations were related to the rush of
institutions to obtain technological innovations without preparing teachers adequately. Regarding
the institutions’ perspective, Karagiorgi (2005) reported the challenges to implement
ICT in several elementary schools in Cyprus.
