As can be seen, the majority of journals in the
survey are published by universities. The large public universities such
as the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Universidade de São
Paulo, Universidad de Costa Rica, Universidad de Chile and the
Universidad de Buenos Aires carry considerable weight. An exceptional case
is that of Colombia, where publishing is concentrated in 5
institutions: Universidad de los Andes, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Universidad
de Antioquia, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana and Universidad del Valle. Another
exceptional case is Cuba, where the Editorial de Ciencias Médicas
(ECIMED) is the third largest institutional publisher in terms of
number of journals within the OLIVA database6.
