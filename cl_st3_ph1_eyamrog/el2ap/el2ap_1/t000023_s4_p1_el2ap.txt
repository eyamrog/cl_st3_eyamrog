Cosmarium abbreviatum var. minus was the only species occurring in
all kinds of environments studied, present in lakes, lagoons and
rivers. Most species occurred in lentic environments, only seven in
lotic systems, and Cosmarium impressulum was the only species that
showed preference for the latter kind of habitat. The most
frequent species was Cosmarium granatum var. granatum, followed by C.
abbreviatum var. minus. Among the environments studied, Limão lake and
Monsarás lagoon presented the greatest diversity, the first with 14
and the last one with 12 out of the 22
species identified during the present inventory. Concerning pH preference, differing
from the idea that genus Cosmarium inhabit most preferably clean
and acid waters (Bicudo & Menezes 2017), only four taxa
occurred in acidic conditions, most species living in circumneutral and
alkaline conditions. Most species exhibited a wide distribution in terms
of trophic state, with 10 species occurring up to mesotrophic
conditions and 12 above eutrophic conditions. Values of total iron
varied from 0.1 to 7.1 mg L-1 in studied systems,
the values for each sampling station are detailed in Zorzal-
Almeida et al. (2021). The great majority of the species
occurred in conditions bellow 4.5 mg L-1, and almost half
of them bellow 1.5 mg L-1. Two species occurred under
conditions of high levels of total iron when compared to
the others, which were Cosmarium norimbergense var. depressum (5.7 mg
L-1) and Cosmarium granatum var. granatum (7.1 mg L-1). Finally,
current study contributed with ecological and taxonomic information to genus
Cosmarium Corda, especially for tropical freshwater environments, and reinforces the
need for more floristic studies in Brazil with ecological information,
mainly in some neglected States such as Espírito Santo State.
