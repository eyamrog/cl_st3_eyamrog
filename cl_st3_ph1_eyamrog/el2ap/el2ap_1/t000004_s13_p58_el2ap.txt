Interestingly, Marianne, not a native speaker of Portuguese, is able
to respond to the Mestre’s apology appropriately in Portuguese. Mestre
João speaks in Portuguese throughout the demonstration, using gestures and
demonstrations to complement his verbal instructions (verbal/gestural/embodied translanguaging). The verbal
element may not be understood by all the students in
the class, yet all seem to ‘get’ the instructions, whether
through the demonstration or by imitating others in the group.
