In spite of the advantages of flexible services for the
population via ICT, in fact, what motivates this race are
economic and control interests between developed and developing countries. The
commercialization of ICT and its services is hidden behind citizenship
discourses. Brenda et al. (2018, p. 5) explain that “citizenship
has been subject to deep forms of marketization. The right
to have rights is therefore conditional on the market and
sharply graded around organized and organizable capacities, resources, interests, etc.”.
These are other reasons why the intensity of the recommendations
and implementations of the use of ICT in different services
should be critically evaluated, since, on the one hand, they
may impact on less investments for the government, but on
the other hand, this may mean more exclusion and a
lower quality of services that require human resources, such as
education, for example.
