Qualitative methods underpinned by the interpretivism paradigm usually take into
account the cultural and social context and practices that shape
the classroom interaction (e.g., Gee & Green, 1998). It is
said that the knowledge is socially constructed through language. These
methods can include linguistic ethnography, sociolinguistics, discourse analysis among others
(Hennessy et al., 2020). In most cases, they stress the
contextual and sociocultural dimensions rather than the verbal exchange per
se (turn- taking) mainly because discourse is framed in a
broad sense: "the text (speech, writing, or image), the discursive
practice of analysis within the text, and the social practices
and structures bound to notions of power and knowledge." (Gregory,
2020).
