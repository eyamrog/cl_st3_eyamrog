On the other hand, gestures and praxis (t= 6.229; p=
0.000), phonemic hearing (t= 7.974; p= 0.000), picture vocabulary (t=
8.187; p= 0.000), and color naming (t= 3.228; p= 0.003)
were found to significantly predict the variability of intellectual performance
in children from Cienfuegos province. The level of prediction for
each variable ranged from 0.217 to 0.660 (Table 3). The
results of the same neuropsychological tests in children from Sancti
Sp√≠ritus, were not significant in predicting the variability of intelligence
performance.
