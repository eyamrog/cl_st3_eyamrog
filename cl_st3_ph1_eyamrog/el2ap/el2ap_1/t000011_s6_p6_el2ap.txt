The results shown here can have an important impact on
evolution and diet studies of non- human primates. Plants' physical
properties that are used or eaten by non-human primates can
be a selective pressure behind morphology and behavior (Lucas et
al. 2012, Youlatos 1999). Lianas are important structural elements of
the forests, with resistant and flexible stems that stay hang
connecting the tops of the trees and providing an access
route to the locomotion of many animals (Rowe 2018, Lambert
& Halsey 2014, Yanoviak 2015, Arroyo-Rodríguez et al. 2015). They
can impact non-human primates’ life and evolution that Youlatos (1999)
suggested the locomotor anatomy of pygmy marmoset may be the
results of feeding and traveling in liana forest. In addition,
a lot of primates use many species of lianas as
important food resources and can represent a large proportion in
their diet, especially during periods of low availability of other
foods (Marshall & Wrangham 2007). Therefore, it is reasonable to
think that the low toughness of liana leaves is an
important factor for the consumption of non-human primates. Accordingly, knowing
the physical properties of lianas structures can be of important
contribution to understanding the evolutionary impact in feeding and locomotor
morphology of non- human primates (Youlatos 1999, Lucas et al.
2012).
