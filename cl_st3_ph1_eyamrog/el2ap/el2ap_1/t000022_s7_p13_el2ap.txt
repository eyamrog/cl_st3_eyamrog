Regarding the disciplinary classification of journals, we faced the challenge
of the different classifications used by the indexing databases, even
for the grouping into scientific areas. Thus, the same journal
could be classified in different disciplines and, as a result,
in different areas. For the OLIVA database, we used a
classification based on the OECD and Frascati Manual criteria. The
assignment of one or more disciplines to each journal was
made through an empirical survey, based on the description that
each journal provides in the "Scope" or "About" section of
its official website. Then the journals were grouped into eight
subject areas: 1) Agricultural Sciences; 2) Social Sciences; 3) Humanities;
4) Engineering and Technology; 5) Medical and Health; 6) Natural
and Exact; 7) Multidisciplinary; and 8) Multidisciplinary-Social Sciences & Humanities
(SSH). The existence of two areas called "Multidisciplinary" is due
to the fact that in the OLIVA database there are
a significant number of journals with a high degree of
diversification and extent in their scope, crossing broader disciplinary boundaries.
Thus, in group 7 we included journals that belong to
at least two subject areas combining “hard” sciences with SSH.
In group 8, we included journals that combine subject areas
only within the Social Sciences and Humanities. This primary classification
allowed us to reduce inconsistencies and to more accurately assess
the disciplinary distribution of the journals analyzed.
