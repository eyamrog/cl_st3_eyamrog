The other disciplinary areas, on the other hand, also show
similar behavior. Overall, articles in Spanish in these journals went
from 92.8% at the beginning of the selected period to
86.6% at the end of the period. In contrast, not
only did the number of articles in English increase (5.6%
to 10.2%) but also those in Portuguese (1.2% to 3%).
This trend was slightly more marked in the cases of
journals from Uruguay and Colombia.
