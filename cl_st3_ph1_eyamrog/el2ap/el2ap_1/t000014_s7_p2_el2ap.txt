In this article, we consider the benefits and challenges associated
with archiving in language documentation. Our discussion draws on our
accumulated knowledge as scholars who are deeply involved in administering,
contributing to, and drawing on language archives, with an emphasis
on the indigenous languages of Latin America. We focus in
particular on the relevance of language archiving in Brazil, and
its significance for scholars, community members, and other stakeholders.
