Similar to other findings, avoidance was mainly directed at colleagues,
superiors, and institutional activities (e.g., research and extension), which can
be explained by the absence or low control over the
environment (AKBARI et al., 2016; BURIÄ† et al., 2016). In
other words, teachers cannot physically avoid the classroom and interaction
with students, but they can choose or avoid colleagues and
activities. In this way, avoidance can help to justify some
of the counterproductive behaviors.
