During the actual game (which is of course non-verbal), the
players are trying to find an exposed or unguarded place
on the opponent’s body. In this way, they might attack
the exposed belly of their opponent doing an aú (cartwheel)
with a cabeçada or they might try to sweep the
leg of the other player while he/she is performing a
kick. Unlike in other martial arts, attacks are avoided rather
than blocked. In a normal circumstance, an experienced capoeirista will
know how to move in a way that he/she is
not exposing any vital points on their body, therefore their
opponent may have to perform several moves until they spot
an opportunity for an attack.
