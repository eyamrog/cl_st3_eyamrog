The pervasiveness of this “intellectual imperialism” – as Syed Hussien
Alatas at the University of Malaya has framed this center-periphery
pattern, beginning in the late 1960s (2000) – has also
given rise to an “academic dependency” theory of relevance to
this paper.6 Its leading scholar, Syed Farid Alatas, at the
National University of Singapore and the University of Malaya, writes
of multiple dependencies afflicting Global South researchers, including a “dependency
on recognition” that leads to “many scholars [being] torn between
satisfying the requirements of publishing in high ranked ‘international’ journals,
particularly those listed in the [Web of Science], and publishing
locally in their own languages” (2022, p. 20). The JUOJS
attest to a certain break with the recognition dependency, just
as these journals address what the Kenyan novelist and essayist
Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o identified as a “need to move the
center from its assumed location in the West to a
multiplicity of spheres in all cultures of the world,” which
Thiong'o framed as part of a “vast decolonization process” (1991,
p. xiv, 3).7
