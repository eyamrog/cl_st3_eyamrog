Collaboration is an interesting and complex phenomenon in the production
published in the journals included in OLIVA. First, it should
be noted that only 25.8% of the articles are authored
by a single author. This varies considerably among the journals
of the different disciplinary areas (see Table 3). It represents
77.2% of the articles in the Humanities and 49.3% in
the Social Sciences. In the Humanities, only 19% of articles
are authored by two or three authors, and there are
very few articles with more than three authors (3.8%). On
the other hand, 40.8% of the articles in the Social
Sciences have two or three authors, and 10% with four
to eight. Table 3 shows that Multidisciplinary SSH journals have
an intermediate percentage of authors compared to the two separate
areas.
