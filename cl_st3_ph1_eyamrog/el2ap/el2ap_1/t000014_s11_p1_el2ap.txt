This section lays out principal considerations relating to the importance
and process of archiving language documentation data. We provide a
general assessment of the significance of this initiative (§2.1), followed
by an overview of the types of digital repositories (§2.2)
and the benefits of archiving for language documentation (§2.3). We
explain how digital language archives differ from other online platforms
(§2.4), and offer some advice on how and when language
documentation data should be archived (§2.5). Throughout this article, we
use the term data to refer to language documentation materials;
that is, recorded examples and/or observations of spoken or signed
language that can be processed, annotated, and analyzed (see e.g.
GOOD, 2022). Primary data are the raw audio or video
recordings or written observations of language, including narratives, oral histories,
elicitation, conversations, interviews, and experimental protocols; secondary data are transcriptions,
translations, morphological segmentations, glosses, and other types of annotation that
require some level of preliminary analysis to create (KUNG, et
al., 2020; HIMMELMANN, 2012; THIEBERGER and BEREZ, 2012). For accessible
overviews of language archiving and its history, see also Henke
and Berez-Kroeker (2016), Berez-Kroeker and Henke (2018), Kaplan and Lemov
(2019), and Kung (2020).
