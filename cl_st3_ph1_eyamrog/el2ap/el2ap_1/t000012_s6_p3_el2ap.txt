These individuals rely on the resources provided by the network
(here, arthropods, injured tissue or blood) and not on particular
hosts. These highly connected species are termed supergeneralists (Jordano et
al. 2003, Thompson 2005). They have extremely specialized lifestyles that
depend on the network they are embedded to survive. As
the supergeneralists occur in the community, they tend to be
relatively more important than others for maintaining structure and functioning
of the community. The specialization of diet in a central
species is not a unique pattern of cleaning networks, since
dietary specialization occurs in other supergeneralists. For example, the centrality
in seed-dispersal networks happens in species that present a higher
centrality degree. Furthermore, centrality was best explained by dietary specialization
(Mello et al. 2014).
