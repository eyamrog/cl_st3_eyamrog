The small number of migrants arriving in Northern Ireland in
the second half of the twentieth century had, for the
most part, settled in large urban areas such as Belfast,
rather than in small towns like those where our study
was based. The local population in towns such as Dungannon
and Cookstown had had relatively little experience of incomers. However,
labour migration to these towns increased significantly in the first
two decades of the twenty first century. Drawing on the
2011 Census data, Doyle and McAreavey (2016, p. 59) have
demonstrated that, by 2011, there was a significant concentration of
migrants of different origins in particular wards in Dungannon. As
they put it: “Dungannon, a town in rural Country Tyrone,
has four wards with over 20% combined migrant levels and
two with over 30%, a significant change to occur in
10 years”. Because of these significant demographic changes, the Timorese
in our study who came to Dungannon in the early
part of the twenty first century reported that they encountered
considerable small-town hostility to incomers and frequent use of racist
language. They also had considerable difficulty in understanding the local
variety of Irish English (Interview with RS and HA, June
2015).
