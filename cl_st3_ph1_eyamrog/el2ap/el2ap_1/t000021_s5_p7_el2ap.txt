Thus, although this family seems to be the most accessible
and adaptive, it was observed that it might also lead
to lesser well-being when analyzing its functions and the interpersonal
and contextual aspects. Moreover, as it involves more elaborate regulatory
components, such as memory and verbal representations, it requires greater
effort and energy in monitoring cognitive processes, consuming individual resources,
resulting in greater exhaustion and poorer performance (e.g., SHEPPES, 2014;
YIN, 2016). Taken together, these considerations reveal that cognitive modification
is not always beneficial and resolving, although it is essential
for gradual adaptation.
