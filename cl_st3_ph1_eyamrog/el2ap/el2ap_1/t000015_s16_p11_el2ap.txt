To assess JUOJS’ research coverage, the title and abstract of
the five most recent articles published in the ISSN-verified journals
were first concatenated, then passed as inputs to a neural
field of study classifier trained on English-language data (Weber et
al., 2020). The use of this classifier required the translation
of all titles and abstracts into English, for which we
used the Ubiquitous Knowledge Project’s EasyNMT. The outputs of the
classifier are distributions of likelihood over all classes, meaning that
it supports multidisciplinary classification. But for ease of reporting, each
journal was assigned the single most probable field of study
label according to the Australian and New Zealand Standard Research
Classification (ANZSRC). This schema was preferred over others because of
the availability of the data set used to train the
neural classifier, examples in which were labeled according to ANZSRC
(Weber et al., 2020). ANZSRC fields map to the OECD’s
Fields of Science and Technology (FOS), but differ from those
embodied by the National Science Foundation’s seven research area directorates.
Differences are mainly found in STEM fields, especially in the
pure sciences. The classifier mitigates this problem of comparison by
assigning basic labels such as Chemical and Physical Sciences, which
the NSF classification then groups into broader research fields.
