The questions were structured into an array (Figure 2), adapted
from Gordon and Dawes (2015). Microsoft Word was used, which
was filled in with the participants’ answers. The interviewees had
access to the array, thanks to Skype’s screen sharing tool,
so they could actively participate in the process of data
gathering, following, and correcting the researcher’s interpretation of their answers.
That method adopts a second-person perspective, wherein the researcher acts
as a mediator, helping participants access their subjective experiences by
questioning them (Keranen et al., 2012). Additionally, it enables a
deeper involvement of researcher and participant with the data, once
both are responsible for the information raised.
