Due to its conservativeness, Polypolish may miss errors that other
short-read polishers can fix, e.g. in regions of low Illumina
depth. However, other polishers can introduce new errors30, which is
unacceptable when aiming for perfection. We therefore recommend trying other
short-read polishers but manually assessing any and all changes using
a tool such as IGV31. Viewing the read alignments at
a particular locus before/after polishing can clarify whether the change
fixed an error (in which case it should be retained)
or introduced an error (in which case it should be
rejected)32. Polishers to try include POLCA33 (due to its low
rate of introduced errors) and FMLRC234 (due to its ability
to fix errors other polishers cannot).
