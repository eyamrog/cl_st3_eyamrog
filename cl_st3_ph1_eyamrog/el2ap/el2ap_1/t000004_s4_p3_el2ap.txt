An obvious consequence of our study would be to find
ways of enhancing the language learning opportunities of capoeira, bringing
in pedagogical strategies to make the language learning opportunities more
systematic and available. The gap between the initial stage of
language learning and a successful language acquisition is usually be
bridged by studying the language as a personal initiative. There
are resources available on the internet and elsewhere to address
this need, such as Portuguese for capoeiristas (WHYATT; BARBERIS; PASCHOAL,
2020), which claims to “teach you the most essential words,
verbs, phrases and grammar in 16 comprehensive lessons based around
popular Capoeira Songs,” and which is available both online and
as a printed publication. From our perspective however Capoeira as
an Additional Language means learning capoeira as an embodied practice
of which Portuguese, specifically an Afro-Brazilian variety is an essential
but by no means the only element.
