Here, two extracts illustrate the excessive use of cued elicitation
(Mercer, 1995) and Socratic questioning (Roth, 1996), respectively; that is,
the use of limiting invitations that constrain the discourse to
a narrow line of reasoning. Students just needed to give
a few-word response to follow the explanation across the scientific
point of view. In the first case, the lesson aim
was to compare water and perfume evaporation. As students could
not see or feel the water evaporating, the perfume played
the role of showing that something was leaving the water
and spreading into the air. The teacher developed this reasoning
(Extract 2).
