Carrying out this phase was possible only with the use
of ICT. The very concept of research article reviews encompasses
a digital dimension. Nowadays, academic publishing processes are conducted online;
thus, all the interactions between editors and authors, editors and
referees, and editors and editorial boards are via the internet.
To have access to these texts, it would be necessary
for the researcher to use ICT, not only because the
authors are in distant locations, but because the texts per
se are in digital format.
