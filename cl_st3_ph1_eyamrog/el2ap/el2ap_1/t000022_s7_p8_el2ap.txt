A database of 1,720 scientific journals published in Latin America
and the Caribbean and indexed in SciELO and/or Redalyc was
built within the framework of OLIVA. The study was organized
on two levels - one at the journal level, and
the other at the document level. The objective was to
map out this circuit of quality scientific literature, addressing the
existing forms of co-authorship, disciplinary characteristics, and languages of publication.
In the first part of this article, we delve on
the description of the journals in the database constructed at
this stage (SciELO and Redalyc). We then pass on to
characterizing the publishing institutions of the journals and highlight their
predominantly public nature and self-management by the academic community. An
empirical classification of the journals’ disciplines was carried out based
on the information found on their respective web sites. This
was done because of the existing limitations of classifying the
documents based on the disciplinary cataloging offered by the indexing
databases. It revealed that the production has broad coverage, with
half of the indexed documents being from the Social Sciences
and Humanities, and the other half from Engineering, Natural Sciences,
and Health and Biological Sciences. We then analyzed the patterns
of co-authorship and the different levels of collaboration – global,
regional (LA) and national. We also analyzed the language patterns
of the corpus, noting the growth of journals that publish
in English and a multilingualism that is emerging in journals
that are beginning to publish in several languages.
