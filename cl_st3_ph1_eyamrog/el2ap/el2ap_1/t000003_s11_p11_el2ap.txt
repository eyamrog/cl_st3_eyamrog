For this reason, our broader research project spans the different
social spaces traversed by the young Timorese migrants participating in
our study. While our main focus in this paper is
on the spaces of conviviality that they are creating within
their local life worlds, on the ways in which they
are building different identities within these life worlds and on
the use of digital resources to portray these practices and
identities to family and friends in Timor- Leste, in the
broader project we are also taking stock of their lived
experience of day-to-day social life in the small-town settings in
which they find themselves and their experience of endeavouring to
gain access to different workplaces. We also include the ways
in which they are positioned within these workplaces, depending on
the language resources and funds of knowledge available to them.
