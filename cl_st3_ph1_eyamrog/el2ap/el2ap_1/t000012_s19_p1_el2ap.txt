The mean diversity of cleaners demonstrate higher values than non-cleaners
in most families. For 18 of the 26 families analyzed
in Brazil and Africa, the mean diversity was significantly higher
for the cleaners (Fig. 3). For example, In Charadriidae family,
the H mean value was about 0.268 without the cleaners
(which in this family, represents about 93% of the members)
but, if only considering the cleaners, the H value was
about 1.265 (which in this family, represents about 6% of
the members).
