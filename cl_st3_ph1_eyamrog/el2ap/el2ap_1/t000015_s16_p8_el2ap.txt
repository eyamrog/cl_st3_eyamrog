The high level of linguistic diversity among JUOJS calls into
question the common linguistic assumption that “English is the language
of science,” as a recent headline in Nature read (Elnathan,
2021). The reign of English in research and scholarship only
began to take hold in the latter half of the
twentieth-century, after sharing the spotlight earlier with French and German;
and while medieval Latin served as the language of learning
in the West, the influx of learning from the Islamic
world in Arabic, through the twelfth-century translation movement, made all
the difference (Hunter-Konos, 2015, Willinsky, 2017, pp. 117-152).
