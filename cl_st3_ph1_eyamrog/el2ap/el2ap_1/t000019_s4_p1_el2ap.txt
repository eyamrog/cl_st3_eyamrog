Given the scenario we have outlined, it can be said
that this reality of insufficient technological infrastructure in public schools
and in households corroborates the idea that neither one nor
the other are prepared for a curriculum that requires the
use of digital equipment and technical knowledge. Added to this
difficulty is the insufficient training of teachers to ensure the
development of their area of specialization in conjunction with DICT
in curriculum development.
