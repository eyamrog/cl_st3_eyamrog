Dialect and register typically intersect. So in capoeira the Portuguese
made available involves a register richly inflected with Afro-Brazilian language
and culture. This is part of the package that might
attract disapproval from mainstream ideology (cf. the comments of Sophie’s
Brazilian ex). If apprentice capoeiristas are learning a register, we
can, following Agha, suggest that the process is one of
enregisterment (AGHA, 2003, RHODES; CLONAN-ROY; WORTHAM, 2020). However the idea
of register here is not narrowly linguistic since it involves
the coordination of visual/verbal/musical/embodied and other elements in an assemblage.
Sophie’s example illustrates that the requirements for the level of
knowledge of Portuguese language and culture are different for a
beginner and for an accomplished capoeirista, the demands as capoeiristas
progress are incremental. This point is also made in the
materials published by Ministério das Relações Exteriores for teaching Portuguese
abroad through capoeira (MINISTÉRIO DAS RELAÇÕES EXTERIORES, 2020). While no
initial knowledge of Portuguese is expected from new students and
the language learning takes place mostly through repeating the chorus
of songs and understanding simple instructions that are often accompanied
by movement, advanced capoeiristas will be expected to perform the
role of the lead singer and have an in-depth understanding
of the meaning of the songs, which includes their cultural
and historical connotations. They will also need to be able
to use Portuguese on a communicative level, as the visiting
mestres at capoeira workshops may have limited English or they
may choose to speak Portuguese during the workshop or at
informal social gatherings that are an integral part of capoeira
events.
