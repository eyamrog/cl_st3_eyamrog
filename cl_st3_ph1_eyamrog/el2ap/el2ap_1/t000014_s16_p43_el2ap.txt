Legacy materials often preserve the voices and knowledge of people
who preceded other documentation projects by many decades, and who
in some cases represent the last first- language speakers or
semi-speakers. In such cases, legacy materials may be a key
source of information for community efforts in language revitalization and
in maintaining or reclaiming cultural heritage, as well as for
scholarsâ€™ efforts to understand the breadth and depth of human
expression.
