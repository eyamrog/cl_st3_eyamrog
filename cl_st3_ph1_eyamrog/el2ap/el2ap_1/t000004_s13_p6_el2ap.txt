Uncertainties surround the origin of the word capoeira. It is
widely thought that it comes from the indigenous Tupi word
caa-apuamera, denominating a young forest in a place that had
previously been cleared. This was a place in which the
runaway slaves practised their fight skills, as well as the
place where they would ambush those sent by their master
to capture them. However, there is no definite support to
confirm this theory (DE ABREU, 2005).
