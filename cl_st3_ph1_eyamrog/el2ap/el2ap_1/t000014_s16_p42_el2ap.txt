The goal in the transportation of legacy materials is for
the materials to be sent to a location that either
(on a temporary basis) has relatively better storage conditions (e.g.,
one that is less humid) or facilitates the transfer of
them to an archive, if not to an archive directly.
The moment of transportation can be one of the most
perilous for archival materials. Ideally, especially delicate materials like tapes
can be transported personally, for example, in carry-on luggage.13 For
other materials, it is important to keep them dry (e.g.,
with plastic coverings) and separate from others that might damage
them. If materials are to be shipped, make sure to
use high-quality cardboard boxes (with ample tape and bubble wrap),
and, when financially possible, opt for airmail over ground transportation,
as this usually involves less repeated handling of boxes. In
general, at this stage it is best to be in
contact with an archive that can provide you with additional
guidance. Archives will also be the best informed to advise
you on cataloging and digitization. We emphasize that digitization of
analog sound recordings and film is in most situations relatively
urgent, as the original tape degrades over time, and in
most situations the prior storage conditions of the materials are
not at an archival standard. Humidity and water damage are
especially common.
