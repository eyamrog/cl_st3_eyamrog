Eleven questions investigated social, academic, and scientific information about the
authors, as well as their opinion on the influence of
some contextual factors in the publishing process of high-impact journals.
Thirty-eight authors participated in this phase, representing 29.92% of the
invited experts – more than the minimum (10–20%) amount that
represents a reliable sample of data, according to Oliveira and
Grácio (2005).
