From this perspective, some researchers have advanced this integration (Flores
et al., 2012; Manga & Ramos, 2006; Matute et al.,
2007) and propose three requirements for developing tests in the
child population: (1) assess neuropsychological skills as an indicator of
the maturation and functioning of certain brain structures in formation,
(2) consider the most appropriate procedures for designing the test
and its items in a given cultural context (e.g., the
go-no go procedure has been widely used to develop attention
tests in different cultural contexts), and (3) interpret the results
through norms (comparing the subject with a reference group) and/or
criteria (comparing the subject with respect to an objective to
be achieved).
