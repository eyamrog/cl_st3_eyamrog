Regarding the intellectual development of the groups, it could be
observed that the performance in the Raven test of the
espirituanos was significantly higher compared to the Cienfuegueros group. These
obtained results emphasize the notion that nonverbal tests are not
necessarily free of cultural influence (Ben et al., 2021). Furthermore,
it highlights that nonverbal tasks contain complex reasoning processes, which
mark the differences between subjects. Certainly, Raven's Matrices require simple
solution strategies (up- down, right-left), although they also include other
implicit strategies such as induction- deduction, comparison of inferences, classification,
hypothesis generation and evaluation, identification of relationships and extrapolation of
images.
