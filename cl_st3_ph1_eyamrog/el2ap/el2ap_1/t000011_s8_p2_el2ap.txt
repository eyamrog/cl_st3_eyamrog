In plants, samples of stems and leaves are made up
of complex tissues linked with different functions (Niklas et al.
2006, Vincent 1992, Wegst & Ashby 2004). For example, fibers
and sclerenchyma in different tissues are related to mechanical support,
while parenchyma functions primarily in storage, but also directly influences
the flexibility of the woody stems, increasing it (Niklas 1992,
Speck & Rowe 1999, MÃ©nard et al. 2009, Gerolamo et
al. 2020). Different tissue and cell types combinations and arrangements
are present in stems, roots, and leaves, generating a diversity
of mechanical properties directly related to the types of stresses
that occur on each plant organ (Niklas 1992). The amount
of water available in complex tissues is also relevant in
determining its mechanical properties (Niklas 1992, Vincent 1990a). In general,
dehydration of biological materials causes structural changes in tissues and
organs, modifying their mechanical properties (Caliaro et al. 2013, Niklas
1992, Niklas et al. 2006, Vincent 1990b). For example, grass
leaves had a gradual increase in stiffness and toughness due
to loss of water content (Vincent 1983). Similarly, in the
stem of self-supporting species, the bending stiffness increases with the
loss of wood tissue moisture content, and dry branches became
more brittle and can fracture more easily when compared to
their moistened counterparts (Niklas 1992). More recently, experimental evidence showed
that petioles of Caladium bicolor lost their bending stiffness with
the increase of water deficit, causing wilting (Caliaro et al.
2013).
