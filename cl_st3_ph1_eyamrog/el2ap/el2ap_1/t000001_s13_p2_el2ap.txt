If culturing and DNA extraction is conducted multiple times (e.g.
once for ONT sequencing and again for Illumina sequencing), there
is the risk of genomic differences between the DNA samples9.
This can lead to difficulties during polishing, so we recommend
using a single DNA extract for all sequencing runs. It
may also be prudent to freeze additional DNA or bacterial
pellets in case further sequencing is later required.
