In contrast to short-read-first hybrid assembly approaches of the past
(e.g. Unicycler), our recommended method follows a long-read-first paradigm. Due
to their improved handling of repeats, long reads form a
solid assembly foundation, with short reads only used for final
polishing. Using this approach, we believe perfect genome assemblies with
zero errors are achievable. However, it is not easy to
establish a ground truth genome sequence, so when assembly accuracy
is critical, we recommend performing multiple alternative assemblies that vary
in data/methods: sequencing platforms, assemblers in the Trycycler pipeline, read
QC thresholds, short-read polishing tools, etc. When alternative data/methods produce
identical assemblies, this builds confidence in their correctness. When alternative
assemblies are not identical, further investigation (e.g. visualising read alignments
in IGV) is warranted.
