The first large-scale study on classroom dialogue was probably Flanders’s
(1970), who depicted the two-thirds rule; that is, in regular
classes, two-thirds of the time is filled by talk; two-thirds
of this talk is teacher’s talk, and two-thirds of this
teacher’s talk is lecturing. Another relevant finding is framed in
the triadic discourse: initiation, response, and feedback or evaluation (Mehan,
1979; Sinclair & Coulthard, 1975). This pattern is possibly the
most common feature in whole-class talk and can account for
up to 70% of all teacher-student interactions (Cazden, 1988; Nassaji
& Wells, 2000; Wells, 1993). Although much of these studies
have taken place in Anglo-Saxon countries, this pattern is recognised
worldwide (Alexander, 2001).
