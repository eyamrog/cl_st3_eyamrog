Digital exclusion can be treated, in general, in two aspects,
in which one compounds the other: exclusion of access to
equipment and the Internet; and exclusion from digital knowledge. In
any case, the digital exclusion indexes are more linked to
the socioeconomic issues of each citizen, that is, to the
socioeconomic inequalities historically continued in Brazil, which precede the existence
of this intense digital world of today.
