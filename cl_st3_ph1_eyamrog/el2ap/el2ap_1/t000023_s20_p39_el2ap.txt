Note: According to Biolo et al. (2013), Cosmarium moniliforme is
very similar to Cosmarium contractum Kirchner, but differs in having
comparatively more subcircular semicells and elliptical apical view. The apical
view of the present specimens was not observed, but the
subcircular semicells outline led to its identification as C. moniliforme.
