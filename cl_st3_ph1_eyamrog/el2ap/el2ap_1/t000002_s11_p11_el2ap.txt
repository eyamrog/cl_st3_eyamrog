At this point at least three aspects must be considered
in relation to the adoption of a research paradigm. First,
it must provide a consistent and coherent account across every
step of the study (Taber, 2013, p. 55). Second, different
paradigms have different purposes and methods that must lead to
different outcomes (p. 68). Third, and finally, any study refers
to a paradigm, if it is not explicit, it is
implicit in the manner that the research questions are framed
and addressed (p. 68). These concerns stress the importance of
thinking carefully on the relationship between the research aims and
the most appropriate methods to find them.
