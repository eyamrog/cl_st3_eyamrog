Questionnaires are a typical instrument used for data gathering during
needs analysis by ESP practitioners (Flowerdew & Peacock, 2001). Using
ICT, however, the benefits of questionnaires increase. First, online questionnaires
might be more dynamic employing multiple stimuli that digital tools
make possible, such as charts, figures, and animations. Moreover, sending
questionnaires by e-mail is useful because they can be easily
re-sent as many times as necessary, the time of response
may be decreased, and participants have the convenience of answering
them wherever and whenever they can. Besides all those benefits,
in the present research, the use of online questionnaires made
it possible to reach members from distant locations. Figure 1
presents those data.
