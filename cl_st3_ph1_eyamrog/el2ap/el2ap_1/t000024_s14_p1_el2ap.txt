Study area - The plants were rescued from the area
determined as Section 4, in Arujá, São Paulo State, and
São Paulo, São Paulo State, where vegetation suppression work occurred
due to the construction of the Rodoanel Mário Covas Trecho
Norte, also reported in Guardia et al. (2021). The layout
is depicted in Figure 1 a. The relocation site of
the rescued plants was located at 4 km from the
suppression area (figure 1 b) (Google Earth 2022). The selected
site for relocation was in the Montane Dense Ombrophilous Forest
in Parque Estadual da Cantareira (PEC), São Paulo State, Brazil.
This park has 7,916.52 ha and is considered one of
the largest urban forests worldwide and one of the main
forest remnants in the metropolitan region of São Paulo city.
In this region, there are many springs, and UNESCO considered
protected area as the Central Zone of the São Paulo
City Green Belt Biosphere Reserve (São Paulo 2009). Most of
the forest is in the middle stage of regeneration, but
there are also a few significant stretches in advanced and
mature stages (São Paulo 2009). The climate is characterised as
mesothermal and humid with minor rainfall deficiencies and water excess
in summer (Cfb classification, Koëppen 1948, Alvares et al. 2013).
The mean annual rainfall is 1,322 mm, with 229.8 mm
in the rainiest month (January) and 31.7 mm in the
least rainy (August) (São Paulo 2009). In this region relocation
area of forest presented 75% shading (Minipa® digital lux meter),
in Macuco Trail (23º24’29” S and 46º34’57” W). The temperature
in this area ranged from 16.5 ºC (June and July)
to 26 ºC (January and February), exceeding 32 ºC in
the hottest months during work of relocation (figure 2). This
temperature variation was similar to that detected at the period
of harvesting of plants (2013-2014 from 15 ºC to 26
ºC, exceeding 32 ºC in the hottest months in according
to INMET 2022). The mean annual rainfall in 2013-2014 was
1,322 mm.
