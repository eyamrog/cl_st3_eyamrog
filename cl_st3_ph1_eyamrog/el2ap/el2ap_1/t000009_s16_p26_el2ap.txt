All this information was fundamental for designing tasks to prepare
the target students (computer science graduate students from around Brazil)
better for the different contextual limitations and constraints they might
face in academia, how to overcome those problems, and/or work
on solutions to eliminate them, changing research practices and contributing
to the development of their community. Praxis, then, was also
affected by using ICT in the contextual TSA, since the
possibility of investigating members of a global community provided the
teacher/researcher with rich information upon which she based her teaching
practices. This issue is discussed deeply in the next subsection.
