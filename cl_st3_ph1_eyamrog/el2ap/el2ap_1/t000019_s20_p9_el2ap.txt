The implicit understanding of learning and the development of autonomy
regarded as dependent on DICT demonstrates the deterministic orientation of
the document in question. It is understood that the use
of DICT alone does not enable the development of critical
and reflective capacities, and is not even a condition for
meaningful learning. As researchers into intellectual development explain, (Davydov, 1999;
Luria, 2008; Lib√¢neo, 2011), meaningful learning for the student depends
on teaching that involves logical-investigative procedures for each science, which
means that the pedagogical approach, oriented by the teacher, is
what impels the student for learning and, later, for development.
Long before DICT existed, teachers had already developed this type
of teaching.
