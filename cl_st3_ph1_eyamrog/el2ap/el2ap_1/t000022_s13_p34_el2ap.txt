There is also a relation between the authorsâ€™ country affiliation
and publication in English. The articles authored only by researchers
from outside Latin America and the Caribbean (8.5% of 643,929
articles with country of affiliation identified) represent 16.9% of the
articles in English. Similarly, those in collaboration with at least
one author from the region and one from outside the
region account for 4.7% of the articles. In both types
of authorship, English is the main language of publication, both
for articles with collaboration outside the region (49.9% of 30,307
articles) and for those without regional collaboration (52.4% of 54,700
articles).
