This study aimed to examine teachers' emotions and emotional regulation
strategies in the face of the different emotional demands of
the classroom. The study advanced the field by presenting a
contextual framework of teachers' emotion regulation, going beyond previous qualitative
investigations that focused on intrapersonal factors associated with regulation. It
is innovative in terms of methodology because it uses focus
groups and compares different groups to search for individual differences
in regulation. In addition, by unfolding the strategy families, the
study can guide teachers in the implementation of the strategies
and help them become more aware of the possible costs
and benefits of specific strategies. Finally, it is believed that
learning a variety of forms of emotional regulation can influence
the desired emotional flexibility, which might enable the teacher for
more functional regulation of emotion.
