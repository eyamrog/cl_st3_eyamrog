If one were to look at the research system of
the magnitude of Brazil at its highest level of aggregation,
one would lose the detail necessary to analyze the complexity
of the interactions inside its boundaries. Table 5 shows co-authorship
by the number of different authorsâ€™ states according to the
disciplinary area of the journals (SciELO classification is used). Clearly,
journals in disciplinary areas that tend to have a greater
number of authors in their articles and documents present a
greater degree of inter-state collaboration. Even the participation of authors
from three or more states exceeds 10% in the Agricultural
Sciences, Exact and Natural Sciences, Biological Sciences and Multidisciplinary journals.
The degree of co-authorship in the three areas related to
the Social Sciences and Humanities is lower, but in no
case does the number of documents with co-authorship between two
or more Brazilian states fall below 29%. A significant portion
of collaboration among authors is no longer between institutions, but
instead between different states.
