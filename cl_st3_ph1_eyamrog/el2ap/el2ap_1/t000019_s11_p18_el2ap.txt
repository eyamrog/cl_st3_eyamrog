With the transformation of the productive processes of today's society,
many professional activities and services for citizens have been converted
to digital models, which requires a minimal knowledge of IT.
In the public sector at the federal level, in Brazil
alone, according to the Digital Government Secretariat at the Ministry
of the Economy, the digitization of services has already reached
54% of the public services offered to the population before
the pandemic. By the end of 2020, the federal government
had made more than 60% of its services available digitally,
with the goal of reaching 100% by the end of
2022 (Brasil, 2020).
