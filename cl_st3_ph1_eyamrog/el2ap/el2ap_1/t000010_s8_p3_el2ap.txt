Another proposed solution is to use several visual type tests,
as it is expected not to have a high cultural
and educational burden. The subject to answer this type of
tasks should preferably use strategies with a minimum of specialized
knowledge, such as up - down, right - left, shallow
- deep, size and color. However, nonverbal tests are not
completely free of cultural bias, as thinking schemes vary from
one culture to another. Nevertheless, in the child population it
is an adequate solution.
