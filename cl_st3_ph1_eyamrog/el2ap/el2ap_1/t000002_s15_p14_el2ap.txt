In the first round, all raters coded the same group-talk
episode and discussed the scheme and rules for alignment and
convergence. After moderate scores were obtained, the scheme was simplified
by dropping some codes, and rules were clarified and written
in more detail. Two raters coded 28% of the episodes
(12 out of 42), and inter-rater reliability was calculated using
Cohen’s Kappa scores through R (RStudio team, 2020). After the
iterative process, an acceptable/excellent level of agreement was accomplished, as
Cohen’s Kappa scores averaged K = .79 (Kappa values for
each code are presented in Table 1). Then, the researcher
finally coded the rest of the material .This procedure makes
the scheme reliable.
