However, there are limitations in the knowledge of how to
do it in educational practice. In particular, educators fragment the
evaluation of integral development into areas of development, which limits
their actions to certain contents and ignores the fact that
it is integral. For example, in a motor skills or
physical education activity, the motor skills dimension is evaluated, ignoring
other skills and knowledge of the child, such as the
identification of objects by name, size and color, the way
of communicating with the educator and other children, and the
final evaluation of the activity, culminating with an appreciation of
the child's values.
