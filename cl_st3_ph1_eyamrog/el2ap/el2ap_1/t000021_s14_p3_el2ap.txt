Teachers were allocated to groups based on two criteria to
maximize sample characteristics and compare results (Figure 1): areas of
training/occupations at IF and career levels. The total sample consisted
of 41 vocational and technological education teachers invited to participate
in the study by IF course coordinators. Most were male
(n = 25). Detailed information about this sample is shown
in Figure 1.
