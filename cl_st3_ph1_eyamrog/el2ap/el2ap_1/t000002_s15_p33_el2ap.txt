Whereas ‘exploring explanations’ involved advancing, extending, and adding to students’
ideas, ‘guiding explanations’ marked sequences headed towards the scientific explanation,
including an effort to use scientific terms more precisely. These
two categories were further divided into four granular typologies. Finally,
‘providing explanations’ labelled sequences in which the teacher delivered an
explanation to the students. In this sample of talk-intensive lessons,
this kind of direct telling was highly interactive, and students
contributed with some words, but the teacher did most of
the conceptual development.
