In addition to the data from CGI.br, the bibliographic survey
carried out regarding teacher training in DICT allowed us to
verify that, at the level of initial teacher training, there
has been little curricular change, even though ICT has been
recommended as part of the official Brazilian curriculum since the
mid-1990s (Gatti & Barreto, 2009; Lopes & Furkotter, 2016; Dorneles,
2012; Santos, 2009; Marinho, 2008).
