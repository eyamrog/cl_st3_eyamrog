The tempo and style of the game are therefore in
the hands of the leader of the roda. If a
student is not in line with the style of the
game that is expected of them like in Sophieâ€™s case
above, he can remind them to adjust their speed through
a song. He can also increase the dynamics of the
game by choosing a song with a faster rhythm and
a message in the lyrics inviting to a more aggressive
game.
