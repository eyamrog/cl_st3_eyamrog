Before the beginning of the practical part, Sandro or one
of the students turns on recorded capoeira music. The practical
part sometimes starts with a warm-up, with the ginga moves
performed individually, the students following Sandro and facing the same
direction. The students also spend a lot of time practising
in pairs. In the practical part of Sandro’s classes we
notice a shift from a predominantly verbal communication used in
the theoretical part to a greater use of communication through
physical movement, regulated as always by the rhythm of the
music. When used, spoken communication is mostly for instruction, often
accompanied by demonstration of the physical movement (language/body translanguaging) which
aids comprehension. The exercise is broken down into parts to
make it easier to follow and the verbal instructions follow
the exercise. Sandro’s first verbal instruction (troca – change) is
followed by a pause, in which he stays for a
moment in a position he wants his students to imitate.
The next verbal instructions (rolê – roll, troca – change)
are immediately followed by the movement. They are deictic and
can be only correctly interpreted when accompanied by the action.
The instructions are in Portuguese, but this does not impede
understanding thanks to the fact that the movement is demonstrated
as well.
