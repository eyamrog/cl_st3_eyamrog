The website Terra (n.d.) based on data from the National
Institute for Educational Studies and Research “Anísio Teixeira” (INEP), showed
that the Amazon, a northern state in Brazil, invested R$
3,075.89 a year per student while, for instance, Santa Catarina,
a southern state, invested R$ 6,829.52. Being education a complex
system, it is not possible to state that every student
from the North is lesser prepared for international academic writing
than the students from the South due to the different
public education they get. As elements that influence educational practices,
however, contextual issues, such as economy and politics, need to
be considered in the needs analysis for CEAP courses. ICT,
as shown in this paper, may help teachers/course developers to
investigate at a distance how those issues impact specific educational
contexts.
