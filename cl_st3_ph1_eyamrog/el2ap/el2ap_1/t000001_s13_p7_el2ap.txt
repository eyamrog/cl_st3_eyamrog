Since Illumina reads will only be used for final polishing
(see Step 5), they carry less importance than ONT reads.
Most current Illumina platforms produce similar data (e.g. 150-bp paired-end
reads) and will function equally well for bacterial whole-genome sequencing,
with instrument choice driven by cost and multiplexing needs. Nextera
XT library preparations produce variable read depth (i.e. some regions
of the genome may have low depth), so Illumina DNA
Prep (a.k.a. Nextera DNA Flex) and TruSeq are preferable16. If
Nextera XT is used, aim for a high mean depth
(e.g. 300×) to compensate for depth variation, otherwise 100× should
be sufficient. For highly repetitive genomes, mate-pair preparations may improve
short-read polishing performance (see Pitfalls). After Illumina reads are produced,
we recommend using a QC tool such as fastp17 to
remove low-quality bases and adapter sequences.
