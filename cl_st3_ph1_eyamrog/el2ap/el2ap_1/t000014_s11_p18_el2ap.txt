Social media sharing platforms, like YouTube, Vimeo and SoundCloud (see
Figure 2), facilitate sharing video and audio files with communities,
speakers, and others because their content is easily discoverable via
online search engines. They facilitate rights management because they allow
the person who uploads the file to choose between traditional
copyright or the application of a Creative Commons license.5 However,
most people do not have a sufficient understanding of either
traditional copyright or the application of Creative Commons licenses to
make an informed decision. These platforms also have their own
versions of graded access in that the content may be
kept private or made public.
