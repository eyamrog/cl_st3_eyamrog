These results can be justified according to the intense or
low educational stimulation in both groups. It is thought that
intense stimulation may explain the similarity because most preschool games
contain many activities where comparisons are made between objects (similarities
and differences); as well as other motor activities where the
child is required to use his right or left hand
depending on his manual preference. However, it is also possible
to think of low stimulation or slow development in these
neuropsychological variables. In other Cuban research similarity - difference and
right - left orientation have been identified as skills with
slow development in preschool children according to their chronological age
(Ramirez, et al., 2015).
