In 2011, Rosés Labrada undertook a trip to several Mako
communities along the Ventuari River and its tributaries in order
to gather community consent for the project as a whole.
As part of this process and attending to local protocols,
village meetings in several communities were held, which resulted in
an invitation to return to work in two communities: Arena
Blanca and San José de Yureva. However, no data were
collected on that first trip. The documentation project thus started
in July 2012, and Arena Blanca was selected as the
site of the first field stay due to its composition
as a largely homogenous Mako-speaking community.10
