Along with this critique of essentialised notions of community, we
also saw the development of a new orientation, across the
social sciences, to the study of contemporary mobilities. A broad
epistemological shift took place away from “sedentarist approaches” (HANNAM et
al., 2006, p. 5) and towards a new concern with
mobility, deterritorialization, and the intensification and diversification of transnational population
movements. Sociolinguists engaged in research in multilingual contexts picked up
on the notion of mobility in a number of ways
and adopted new conceptual compasses: For example, Heller (2011, p.
5-6) argued that we need to turn our gaze away
“from stability to mobility” and engage in a fundamental rethink
of both theory and method in this area of research.
As she put it: “Tools of enquiry refined when the
focus was on boundaries, stability and homogeneity require refashioning for
addressing movement, diversity and multiplicity” (HELLER, 2007, p 6). Instead
of focusing on “stable communities”, she stressed that we need
to focus on the development of the trajectories of different
social actors over time and space and build an understanding
of how the communicative repertoires of these social actors are
shaped within these trajectories. The notion of trajectory provides a
way of taking account of the intersecting dimensions of time
and space, and of moving away from synchronic accounts. In
addition, it enables us to capture some of the complexity
of contemporary transnational movements, including those that involve extended sojourns
in different countries and, hence, access to diverse language resources
and funds of knowledge
