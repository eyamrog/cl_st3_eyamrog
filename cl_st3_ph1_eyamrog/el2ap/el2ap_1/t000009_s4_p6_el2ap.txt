At this point, it is necessary to consider that, although
ICT makes possible the improvement of contextual TSA for reaching
a global discourse community, it may also limit such an
improvement in regions and countries where teachers and course developers
have no access to them. Unfortunately, the scientific equity that
CEAP aims to promote among students depends on an array
of factors that are out of instructors’ control. It is
important, however, that ESP teachers and practitioners keep on searching
for ways to bring more access to underrepresented minorities through
language courses. As Bazerman et al. (2009, pp. XIV) remember,
“advancing the communicative competence of all, making available the genres
of power and cooperation, is a matter of social capacity
and social justice”.
