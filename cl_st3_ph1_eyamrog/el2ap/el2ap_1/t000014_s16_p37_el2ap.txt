The preservation of legacy materials involves certain key steps: locating
the materials; appraising their physical condition; organizing them in a
basic way; transporting them to an archive or other (temporary)
safe location; carrying out any necessary conservation remediation; cataloging them;
and, ideally, digitizing them (perhaps not necessarily in this order).
Locating legacy materials is often one of the more difficult
steps, requiring either inadvertently being made aware of their existence
and location, or a good deal of sleuthing. In general,
locating legacy materials is made easier by having a deep
familiarity with the histories of research and other activities such
as exploration in particular regions across many disciplines. More concretely,
one should pay attention to descriptions, often in the methodology
or similar section, of early publications (and unpublished works, when
available).
