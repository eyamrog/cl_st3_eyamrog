The evolution over time of the distribution of languages of
publication can also be analyzed. In the last decade, English
has increased its relative share at the expense of Portuguese,
while Spanish has remained approximately constant (see Figure 8). A
disaggregated examination of the two predominant linguistic contexts - Portuguese
and Spanish - reveals some trends that are worth highlighting.
In the case of journals from Brazil, the share of
articles in English went from representing 24% in 2009 to
58% in 2018. The decrease in the relative weight of
articles in Portuguese over this period was of the same
magnitude, while Spanish remained at a modest 3%. This trend
of English is repeated in all disciplinary areas, but very
attenuated in the Social Sciences and Humanities, while it is
strongly endorsed by the Agricultural Sciences, Medical and Health Sciences,
Engineering and Technology, and Exact and Natural Sciences. The predominance
of English was already noticeable at the beginning of the
period as represented in the journals of the latter disciplinary
area.
