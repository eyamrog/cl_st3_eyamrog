The above results have in common the contributions of Ardila
(1995), who suggests analyzing neuropsychology and its relationship with culture
and education through six units of analysis: (1) the standardization
of current basic neuropsychological instruments should consider the cultural and
educational changes of the target subjects, as well as the
cultural context where standardization takes place, (2) elaboration and validation
of neuropsychological tests specific to the cultural context, (3) the
analysis of educational factors and subcultural variations in relation to
test performance, (4) the analysis of cognitive disorders in cases
of brain pathology in different cultural and educational contexts, (5)
the search for commonalities in neuropsychological performance among existing human
groups, and (6) the analysis of the origins of cognitive
activity.
