This is an exploratory study with a case study design
because it occurs in a specific context, a Federal Institute
(IF), located in a northeastern state in Brazil. Data collection
was performed using the focus group technique to explore teachers'
emotions and how teachers deal with emotional demands. Eight focus
groups were performed with an average duration of one hour
each. First, we conducted four focus groups (A, B, C,
and D) and then the other four (E, F, G,
and H). We adopted this procedure to cover the diversity
of training areas/occupations (basic and technical subjects) and career paths
at the IF (beginners - up to five years of
experience at the IF, and non-beginners - more than five
years of experience at IF). This procedure allowed us to
explore the effects of these variables on strategy selection, encompassing
a greater diversity of situations experienced and to detail strategies
(see Figure 1). This criterion was adopted considering three stages:
a) the beginning of the teaching career in Brazil (1
- 5 years), marked by introductory formative experiences and difficulties
in adaptation, b) stabilization phase (5 - 8 years), and
c) the career maturity phase (FERREIRA, 2014).
