Enabling access may require creative solutions. One model that has
met with considerable success is the “distributed digital audiovisual archive”
or “jukebox archive” (BARWICK, 2004; BARWICK et al., 2005; O’MEARA
and GONZÁLEZ GUADARRAMA, 2016). This initiative, originally piloted in Australia,
involves setting up a computer in a community center or
other neutral location where community members can easily access it,
and does not require a connection to the internet. The
jukebox computer contains language documentation materials – audio and video
recordings, as well as (potentially) transcriptions, photographs, etc. – in
easily movable file formats (such as .mp3), as well as
the capacity to burn CDs/DVDs and to download files onto
a flash drive, phone, or .mp3 player. Community members can
thus take copies of materials home with them, and can
also add to the jukebox by uploading their own. Another
useful model relies on a local wifi transmitter called a
‘Raspberry Pi’, which is effective in contexts where people have
smartphones and the associated skills, but have limited or no
computer literacy (e.g. THIEBERGER, 2019).
