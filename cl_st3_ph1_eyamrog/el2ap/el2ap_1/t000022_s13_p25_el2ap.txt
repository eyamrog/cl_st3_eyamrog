In the case of authors from Chile, it is worth
noting some nuances in the general trends in the OLIVA
database. The proportions of articles with individual authorship or with
international collaboration are more than double than those of the
journals of Brazil, with a lower incidence of collaboration within
the country itself. Co-authorship with colleagues located in other countries
is the highest of all, a feature which, as explained
below, may be indicative of an academic culture with peculiarities
within the region. Among the remaining cases, Cuba presents similarities
with Brazil although with a greater degree of international collaboration.
On the other hand, Colombia and Mexico are similar to
Chile, although with a greater proportion of national collaboration.
