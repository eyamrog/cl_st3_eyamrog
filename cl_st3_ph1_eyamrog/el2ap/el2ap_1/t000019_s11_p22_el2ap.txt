In the case of Education, the process of digitalization has
also followed the economic line, trying to invest less and
less in teacher training and in the formation of society
in general, and increasingly in technologies that control the management
of public departments and replicate didactic content without spending on
human resources (Libâneo, 2016a; Freitas, 2011; Evangelista, 2013). On the
quality of learning, the substitution of teachers for digital didactic
resources feeds a process of reproduction of the current system,
which serves the dominant elites, as the insufficient pedagogical quality
significantly weakens the quality of learning, failing to achieve even
technical objectives of training (Costa & Libâneo, 2018; Nascimento et
al., 2020).
