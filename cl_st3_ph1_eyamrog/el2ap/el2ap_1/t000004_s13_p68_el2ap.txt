The ginga represents the moment of a relative peace, when,
however, the capoeiristas are evaluating the weak points of their
opponent and preparing an attack. This alternates with action –
attacking or escaping the attack. When practising the movements in
the class outside the roda, both Sandro and Mestre João
like to mark the transition between the ginga and the
action gesturally with a clap of their hands. Similarly, Mestre
João likes to mark with a clap the transition between
the theoretical part of the class and practical one. The
action follows the music – especially in the moments between
attacks, such as when performing the ginga.
