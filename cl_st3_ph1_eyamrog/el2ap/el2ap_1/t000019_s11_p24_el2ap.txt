IBGE surveys (2018) show that 33% of the Brazilian population
is somehow digitally excluded. It may seem like a good
result if we consider that, in 2009, it was practically
the opposite: only 39% of the population accessed the Internet.
However, when we look closely at the current data, it
is observed that 50% of the Brazilian population of classes
D and E still do not have access to the
Internet; while more than 90% of classes A and B
have such access (CGI.br, 2019a). These figures show that, fundamentally,
the digital divide is not the result of an age
group that has or has not had contact with ICT
since childhood. Despite some advantage of the so-called digital natives,
digital exclusion has more to do with the opportunities for
access to digital devices, as well as with their learning
opportunities (Conceição, 2019; Krug et al., 2018).
