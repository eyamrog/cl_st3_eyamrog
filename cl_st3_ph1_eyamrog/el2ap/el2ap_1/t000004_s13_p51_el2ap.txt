The extract above is an example of a verbal comment
happening simultaneously with singing, but speaking and singing normally exclude
each other in the capoeira class. When Sandro starts playing
the berimbau at the beginning of the class, it serves
as a signal and the students stop chatting. Soon after,
he also starts singing the opening lines of the Ladainha,
a song that is traditionally used in capoeira Angola at
the beginning of the roda. It is therefore a part
of a ritual and it contains references to God and
the great mestres, and the students should listen to it
carefully to fully understand its message (PINHEIRO, 2022). The students
join Sandro, singing the chorus. Without a pause, Sandro then
moves on to another song.
