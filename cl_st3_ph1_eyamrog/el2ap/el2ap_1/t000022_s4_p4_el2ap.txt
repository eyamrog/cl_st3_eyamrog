An examination of the publishing institutions of the journals in
the OLIVA corpus shows structural differences with mainstream commercial journals,
such as in the degrees of autonomy and attachment to
the academic community. Neubert and Rodrigues (2021) analyzed Latin American
production in the Web of Science and observed that these
articles were published in 11,965 scientific journals, with commercial publishers
accounting for 56.48%, universities for 18.30%, and associations for 19.25%.
The SciELO and Redalyc journals, in contrast, have an eminently
academic trait, being published almost entirely by universities, scientific societies
and government agencies, offering a platform of editorial services anchored
in the public domain. In the region, the creation of
journals has historically been in the hands of the scholarly
community, which continues to support them materially even though the
evaluation systems encourage their academics to publish in mainstream journals.
