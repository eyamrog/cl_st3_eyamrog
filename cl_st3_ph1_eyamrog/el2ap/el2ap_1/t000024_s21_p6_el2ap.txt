During the initial stage of establishment in the new environment,
i.e., between bromeliad removal and relocation, a nutritional deficiency could
also occur due to the limited nutrient availability, contributing to
apical bud inactivation and leading to the stimulation of the
axillary sprout production. According to Freitas et al. (1998), the
leaf loss that occurs during their establishment in the new
environment might be related to natural senescence or an adaptative
response.
