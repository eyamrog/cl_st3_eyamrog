In our analysis of the capoeira sessions we visited we
have drawn on translanguaging (BAYNHAM; LEE, 2018), drawing out the
different communication modalities that make up the capoeira space: verbal,
gestural, embodied, musical and examining how they work together at
different stages of the session. In fact in this paper
we extend the framework proposed by Baynham and Lee, to
include the role of music in our analysis, given its
centrality in capoeira practice. So from this perspective the pervasive
rhythmical coordination of the capoeira body with music can be
understood as a form of translanguaging, with music a crucial
element in the spatial repertoire (RYMES, 2014, PENNYCOOK; OTSUJI, 2015,
CANAGARAJAH, 2018) of capoeira.
