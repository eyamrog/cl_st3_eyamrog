Although less mentioned, the situation selection family emerged in all
focus groups. It entails avoiding circumstances and events (for instance,
people, activities, and methodologies) that trigger negative emotions and approaching
those situations that activate positive emotions. This occurs especially when
teachers prepare lesson plans, activities, and teaching materials and program
alternative resources, such as videos, games and music, considering the
stage of life, difficulties, affinities, and interests of their classes
to be responsive, effective, and minimize the emotional work that
can be activated by unpleasant events (TAXER; GROSS, 2018; PEREIRA;
MARINOTTI; LUNA, 2004). Although situation selection appears beneficial for the
teacher and the student, it seems to be used less
often because it is a more forward-looking strategy, which requires
repertoire, the ability to predict their own emotional reactions and
those of others (GROSS, 2015). Thus, it is possible that
teachers' planning, technical and relational preparation, and emotional awareness make
it possible to implement these strategies.
