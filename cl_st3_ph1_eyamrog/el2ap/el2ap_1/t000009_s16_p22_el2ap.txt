Finally, in addition to enabling the researcher to reach participants
distant from her, in different regions of Brazil and abroad,
conducting the interviews online also gave the participants the convenience
of being interviewed at the best time and place for

Interviewing members of a global community enabled the teacher/researcher to
observe and recognize beliefs, behaviors, accesses, restrictions, and power relations

of their English knowledge to write academic texts, their international
academic experience, and how they perceive the level of influence
of contextual issues on the acceptance of Brazilian computer scientists’
papers by high-impact journals in the field.
