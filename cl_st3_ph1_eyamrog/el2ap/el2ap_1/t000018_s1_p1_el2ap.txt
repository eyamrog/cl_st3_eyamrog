Introduction. Luria's theory allows the analysis of psychological development after
brain injury, both in adults and children. Objective. To analyze
the content of a group of articles where the evaluation
of the preschool child has been carried out from Luria's
theory in order to relate it to the foundations of
early childhood education. Methodology. The selection of articles was made
considering several search equations, from 2015 to 2022, coming from
eight databases: SCOPUS, WOS, SCIELO, PUBMED, DIALNET, LATINDEX, SCIENCEGATE, EBSCO.
Results. The experience of Luria and his followers has allowed
him to work with neuropsychological factors as indicators to assess
neurological alterations in man, although the review of the articles
has allowed us to conclude that Luria's contributions are related
to the objectives of early childhood education: an assessment with
an integral approach. From this perspective, the authors of the
article propose five executions to analyze the integral development of
the preschool child. Conclusions. Luria's theory can be used in
early childhood education to carry out the assessment of the
preschool child with an integral approach.
