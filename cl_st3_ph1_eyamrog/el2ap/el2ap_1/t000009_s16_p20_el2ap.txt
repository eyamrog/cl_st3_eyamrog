Part 2 was conducted as a typical semi-structured interview. Participants
were presented with data gathered from the analyzed questionnaire regarding
contextual factors – such as sexism, xenophobia, social and academic
bias – that, according to the 38 respondents, might influence
the publication of papers, as well as to the profile
of Brazilian computer scientists who have published in refereed journals.
Then, they were asked to interpret those findings (cf. Vieira,
2019b).
