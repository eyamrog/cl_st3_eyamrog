First, the Chi-square test was used to determine the parity
criteria between some demographic variables of the study, such as
sex. The t-test (mean comparison test for independent samples) was
used to compare the mean of the study groups in
the different neuropsychological variables and intelligence. The calculation of the
magnitude of the effect size was applied in order to
identify the size of the differences in the variables studied.
For this purpose, Cohen's d was used, where values of
0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 represent small, medium and large effect
sizes, respectively.
