The ability to speak English is increasingly used by employment
agencies to select employees. Thus, for example, there is an
initial screening process in which applicants are interviewed in English
before being given an application form. Those who have some
capability in English move into positions of greater responsibility in
the workplace (e.g. taking on supervisory duties or assisting veterinary
staff with poultry inspection). A linguistic hierarchy of the kind
described by DuchÃªne et al. (2013) is clearly being created
through these recruitment and workplace practices. In this context, the
Timorese migrants are experiencing a re-stratification of their language resources.
Those who benefitted from their knowledge of Portuguese in Timor-Leste,
have now found that these resources are no longer valued
in their new work environments.
