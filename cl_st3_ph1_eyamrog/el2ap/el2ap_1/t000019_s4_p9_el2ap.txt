The necessary inclusion of ICT in education cannot be denied
due to its cultural role in today's society. Instead, it
is more relevant to include them using critical pedagogical approaches
that consider their socio-historical and cultural aspects for broad human
development. Otherwise, it contributes, on the one hand, to the
digital exclusion cycle for low-income populations especially, and, on the
other hand, it maintains the space already well occupied by
instrumental and deterministic pedagogical approaches, contributing to the consolidation of
these approaches. Instead of denying the integration of DICT in
schools, which continues to exclude people and generates even more
exclusion, it is necessary to strive for conditions of excellence
in public schools, as well as appropriate human resources in
order to qualify teaching.
