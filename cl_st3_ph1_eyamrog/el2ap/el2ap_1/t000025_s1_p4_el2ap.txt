Methods: Searches were performed in CINAHL, LILACS, Embase, Web of
Science, PubMed, Cochrane, NICE, Scopus, JBISRIR, and gray literature, in
English, Portuguese and Spanish, with no time limit. Two authors
independently reviewed all citations and a third was called in
case of divergence, and studies in adults with Malignant Fungal
Wounds reporting topical pain interventions were included. In addition, a
data extraction tool for synthesis and thematic analysis was developed.
This study followed the PRISMA-ScR Checklist.
