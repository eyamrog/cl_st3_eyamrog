While there has been a significant pattern of labour migration
to England since the mid twentieth century, large-scale migration to
Northern Ireland is a much more recent phenomenon. Northern Ireland
only began to see an increase in inward migration at
the beginning of the twenty first century. This increase was
quite significant. Doyle and McAreavey (2016, p. 52) point out
that: “Between the 2001 Census and the 2011 Census, the
number of non- UK/Ireland migrants to Northern Ireland tripled (from
1.6% to 4.5% [of the local population])”. Two main political
developments lay behind this increase in migration: First, the culmination
of the Peace Process in Northern Ireland on December 2,
1999, and the subsequent change in the political economy of
this region of the UK, including inward investment in infrastructure.
Second, the accession of different nation-states in Eastern Europe and
the Baltic to the European Union, from 2004. This expansion
of the European Union facilitated labour migration, to the Republic
of Ireland (in the south) and to Northern Ireland, from
Poland and from the Baltic States, especially from Lithuania (CORRIGAN
et al., 2015, DOYLE; McAREAVEY, 2016). However, following the UK
exit from the European Union on 31st January, 2020, the
migration route to Northern Ireland, from the European Union, has
no longer been open.
