Each phase of the capoeira session exhibits different combinations of
available modalities. In our ethnographic study, in the first expository
phase, both English explanation and Portuguese interact with music, contramestre
Sandro is able to take the group into the deep
cultural memory embodied in apparently simple lyrics and connect them
to the present. In the second practice phase, as the
group practises moves singly or in pairs, Sandro circulates and
uses an instructional register drawing on English, Portuguese, gesture and
the body. In the roda phase the instructional scaffold is
removed and the jogadores try out their moves and their
malandragem with each other and the contramestre. Here the body
speaks through gesture and movement, expressing itself through nuances of
the moves that make up the regulated improvisation of the
capoeira habitus.
