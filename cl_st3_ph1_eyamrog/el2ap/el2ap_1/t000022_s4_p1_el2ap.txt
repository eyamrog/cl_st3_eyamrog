Many experts warned as early as the 1980s and 1990s
that the science produced in Latin America was not visible
to the world because it was rarely cited in "international"
databases, which is why Gibbs (1995) spoke of a "lost
science of the third world". In fact, it was in
those decades that an infrastructure for scholarly communication was strengthened
in the region which sought to raise the value of
research outputs produced in this part of the world with
its uniqueness in disciplines, research agendas and language of publication.
This encouraged policies and the regional management of the circulation
of Latin American science, giving rise to a strong and
consolidated structure of journals, indexing bases, institutional repositories, networks of
regional institutes, and large national universities that became regular publishers
of academic journals. This arrangement grew in a fragmented way
because, despite the best of institutional efforts, interoperable systems still
have not been achieved to allow for the scientific production
of Latin America to be known, visible and valued world-wide.
It is with this objective in mind that the OLIVA
project was developed at the Universidad Nacional de Cuyo (Mendoza,
Argentina) to enhance the value of the production assessed and
indexed in articles in such a way as to have
a growing presence and impact in academic assessment systems.
