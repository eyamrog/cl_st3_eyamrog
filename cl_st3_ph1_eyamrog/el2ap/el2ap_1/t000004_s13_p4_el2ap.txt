Not all slaves accepted their conditions passively. Rebellions occurred already
on some of the slave ships, when the Africans overtook
the command of the ships and steered them back to
African shores. In Brazil, escapes, revolts and resistance occurred during
the whole period of slavery. The fugitive slaves gathered in
quilombos, settlements which varied in size, duration and distance from
other civilizations, in which they established a political, social and
cultural order based on the one in Africa (GOMES, 2015).
The most famous of these was the Quilombo of Palmares,
which gathered between 6,000 and 30,000 people (MARQUESE, 2006) and
for a long time resisted attempts to conquer it. In
terms of the routine of slaves living on agricultural properties,
they were woken up by the sound of a bell
and taken by the landowner to work in the fields,
from where they only returned at the dusk. The slaves
were exposed to corporal punishments for every minor transgression. These
included lashing, marking the skin with hot iron, mutilations, rape
and other often highly elaborate methods of torture (AIDOO, 2018).
