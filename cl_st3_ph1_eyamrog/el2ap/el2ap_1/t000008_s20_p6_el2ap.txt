The tolerance of C. alba seeds/pyrenes to prolonged water immersion
should be further investigated to understand if the heightened germination
is sustained. High and fast germination after flooding can be
a vital trait for maintaining monodominance since most buried propagules
are recruited at the end of the seasonal flooding period
in the Pantanal wetlands (Bao et al. 2018).
