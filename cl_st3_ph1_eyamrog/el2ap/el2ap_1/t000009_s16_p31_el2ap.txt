This information helped the teacher/researcher understand the order of relevance
of each investigated factor (contextual, textual, linguistic, etc.) to the
acceptance/rejection of Brazilian computer scientists’ papers by high-impact journals. It
is clear, in Table 3, that, although a good ability
to write papers in English is considered in the referees’
reviews, it is not a defining criterion for recommending the
publication of the paper or not. Rather, the validity and
originality of the work are what counts more, followed by
clarity, organization, and accuracy of the information in the manuscript.
After assessing students’ present situation, the teacher/researcher could plan an
appropriate syllabus and design effective tasks to fulfill students’ needs
(cf. Vieira, 2019a).
