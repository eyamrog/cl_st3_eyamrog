This shows that the analysis of psychophysiology in man can
take two directions: organic psychophysiology aimed at explaining brain functioning,
and activity psychophysiology aimed at describing and explaining the mental
processes underlying human actions. Both directions are grouped in cognitive
neuroscience, a branch of knowledge that deals with the scientific
study of the biological mechanisms underlying cognition, with a specific
focus on the neural substrates of mental processes and their
behavioral manifestations.
