At the end of the interview, each participant was asked
to share with the teacher/researcher a received review of papers
that had been either accepted or rejected by a computer
science high-impact journal. By e-mail, 17 texts were sent by
them, representing 12 different publishing processes – four of which
recommended rejection of the paper, and the other eight accepted
the work. For data analysis, Huckin’s (2004) content analysis methodology
was also used, as well as AntConc for raising specific
information from the texts.
