The internal consistency of the B-PREA-R showed appropriate values for
a psychometric test with several subtests: alpha = .85 and
alpha when the item is removed between .83 and .86.
The previous version also showed appropriate values (alpha when the
item is removed between .78 and .81), although it presented
an internal consistency with the test- retest method between .82
and .94. Thus, it is recommended that an analysis of
internal consistency through the test-retest method be carried out for
future research.
