Faced with this problem, some solution proposals have emerged, firstly,
to apply several tests selected from different neuropsychological batteries (cross-battery)
(Franzen, et al., 2022), and secondly, to apply non-verbal neuropsychological
tests (Ben et al., 2021). The cross-battery procedure is a
suitable opportunity for examiners, as it allows using tests that
are more effective for the subject according to his or
her cultural and educational condition (Franzen, et al., 2022; Daugherty,
et al, 2017; Puente, et al, 2017). Said authors recommend
using the procedure to decrease errors in diagnosis due to
cultural or educational effect, even to avoid death sentence in
the US Supreme Court. According to the authors, the classification
standards for an American is not the same as for
a Hispanic American, both coexist in the same cultural space,
although the diagnosis of a neurological disease or the ruling
of a court may be influenced by the effect of
the culture and education of the subject. Therefore, an error
in diagnosis by classification regulations can change a subject's life,
as an inmate with mental retardation or neurological diseases is
not sentenced to death (Daugherty, et al., 2017; Puente, et
al., 2017).
