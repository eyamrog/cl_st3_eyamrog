From its historical origins as a resistant and violently repressed
bundle of music, dance and martial arts practices of the
African diaspora in Brazil, capoeira has travelled, becoming a global
phenomenon with groups and networks in diverse sites around the
world, including London, Cape Town and Hong Kong and indeed
Leeds where this research was based. We focus on the
linguistic, cultural and embodied ensemble of capoeira, researching a capoeira
group with diverse participants led by Sandro, a Brazilian contramestre,
providing a rich laboratory for what has been called language
learning “in the wild”, specifically of the Afro-Brazilian linguistic and
cultural practices (music, movement, lyric, voice) that are a crucial
element of the capoeira ensemble. These linguistic and cultural practices
contingently bring together, in rehearsal and performance, the characteristic capoeira
dance/ martial arts movements, the pervasive regulation of rhythm and
the apprenticeship of the body into its rhythm and movement.
Seen from the perspective of informal language learning the capoeira
group seems to constitute a near optimal context. We will
explore the affordances of the capoeira group for linguistic/cultural/embodied learning
of Afro-Brazilian Portuguese, drawing on the “maximalist” framework for translanguaging
(BAYNHAM; LEE, 2019), which we extend to encompass the pervasive
musical aspect of capoeira, linking these to contemporary perspectives on
language learning, particularly informal language learning and language learning “in
the wild”.
