In response to these limitations, the present study aims to:
(1) Determine the variability of neuropsychological tests between a group
of preschoolers with typical development in the province of Cienfuegos
and another in Sancti Spiritus, both located in Cuba, and
(2) Identify the neuropsychological functions that influence intellectual performance taking
into account that both are provinces with different cultural characteristics,
but with a similar education policy.
