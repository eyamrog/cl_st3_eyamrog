This small case study illustrates three main points: 1) it
is crucial that we explain archiving in ways that communities
and individual participants can understand; 2) communities and participants should
be able to revisit their decisions; and 3) we should
try to anticipate future uses of the materials and make
provisions where possible, while being fully aware that we cannot
foresee the future. Ultimately, ethical choices are not necessarily defined
in black and white, and what works in one specific
context may not necessarily work in another (HOLTON, 2009; GASSER,
2017). However, as long as we aim to uphold principles
of respect, reciprocity, responsibility, and relationships, as advocated by Rice
(2006), we should be able to avoid some of the
potential ethical pitfalls that could arise as part of the
archiving process.
