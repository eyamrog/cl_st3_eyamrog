Regarding W. cyathiformis (table 6), when relocated as terricolous or
epiphytic, they did not show significant differences between the numbers
of sprouts during each observation (p > 0.05). This indicates
that the form of relocation, terricolous or epiphytic, did not
influence the emission of sprouts during the experiment. Also, it
was observed that sprout production remained constant (p > 0.05)
over time, either in the form of terricolous or epiphytic.
This behavior denotes that the emission of sprouts is constant
over time, regardless of the form of relocation. Probably, the
emission of new sprouts was due to the abiotic stress
caused by the new environment of fixation in the phorophytes
and transplantation in the forest ground. According to Jasper et
al. (2005) the new roots originated from the shoots might
contribute to its fixation to the phorophyte. These authors related
that the new root development is slow and occurred in
a mean of six to 12 months after transplanting. In
this work, it was decided not to evaluate the development
of the root system in order not to cause physical
damage to the young roots due to the removal of
the specimens from the relocation site, such as from the
soil. The importance of the root system for epiphyte attachment
was commented by Jasper et al. (2005) who found high
mortality rate in Vriesea friburgensis Mez due to insufficient attachment
to the phorophyte. Likewise, Barrancos (2016) showed that presence of
new roots gripping the trunk contribute to survival of relocated
specimen.
