The Paresi language documentation project started in 2006 and was
developed via Brandão’s doctoral and postdoctoral research on the language.
The EN language documentation project began in May 2019, with
completion expected at the end of 2022. The goals of
both projects were to organize a large corpus of audio
and video recordings, spanning a variety of linguistic genres, and
transcribed in the relevant indigenous language and translated into Portuguese.
