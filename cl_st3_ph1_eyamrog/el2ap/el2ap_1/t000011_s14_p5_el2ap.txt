To obtain the relative water content (RWC; %), we used
five samples of stems and leaves with the same dimensions
as those used in biomechanical tests. The relative water content
(%) in the stem and leaf at each dehydration level
i was calculated as: [(wi - wd) / (wt -
wd)] x100, where wi is the mass (in g) of
the stem or leaf sample at dehydration level i (i.e.,
at each interval of time), wt is the mass of
the sample at full hydration, and wd is the mass
of the dry stem or leaf (Scoffoni et al. 2014).
To obtain the full hydration and dry mass of the
stems and leaves, samples were floated in distilled water in
a tray with damp papers for 24 h and weighed
at least three times until stabilizing the mass. At the
end of the imbibition period, samples were placed in the
oven-drying, at 60 ËšC for 24h, and weighed at least
three times until mass stabilization to obtain the dry mass
(Turner 1981). Anatomical procedures and analyses - The stem and
leaf sample were cut in transverse sections, using a sliding
microtome. Before sectioning, the samples were gradually embedded in polyethylene
glycol- PEG 1500 (Rupp 1964). To avoid tearing apart phloem
and xylem during the sectioning, expanded polystyrene dissolved in butyl
acetate was brushed on the stem samples, and an adhesive
tape was attached before a section was cut (Barbosa et
al. 2010). The stems and leaf sections were double stained
in 1 % w/v Astra blue and 1% w/v safranin,
helping sort cells with cellulose from those with cellulose and
lignin (Bukatsch 1972, Kraus & Arduin 1997), and permanent slides
were prepared with Canada balsam.
