The belief that the possession of digital equipment alone automatically
leads to complete knowledge is a fallacy, since research (Peixoto
& Ara√∫jo, 2012; Luria, 2008; Davydov, 1999) shows that knowledge
depends, among other conditions, on receiving formal instruction, having concrete
favorable teaching conditions, psycho-emotional conditions, etc., in addition to access
to equipment. On the part of teachers, access to equipment
and the internet alone are also not enough for them
to be able to make pedagogical use of ICT in
an integrated manner in their area of specialization, as they
also need to acquire the necessary knowledge.
