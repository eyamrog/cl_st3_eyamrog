Gross (2015) suggests that research on emotional regulation in specific
work contexts can yield important information about the process, the
contextual application, and the immediate outcomes (e.g., emotional outcomes) of
particular types of regulation. Moreover, this author holds that a
promising line of investigation is to identify how each strategy
translates into specific tactics and how different strategies combine, producing
a chain, thus departing with traditional models that consider strategies
in a decontextualized, isolated, and linear way. In practical terms,
such an approach can more effectively assist teacher education programs
and interventions to broaden the teacher's emotional repertoire. Theoretical and
conceptual issues, empirical evidence, and recent questions that underlie and
justify this study are presented in the following sections.
