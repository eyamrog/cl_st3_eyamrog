In his volume on the sociolinguistics of globalisation, Blommaert (2010)
called for a “sociolinguistics of mobile resources”, one that takes
account of the diverse material and symbolic ties that get
established across global networks. He argued that we need a
sociolinguistic analysis that represents linguistic and semiotic phenomena as being
located and distributed across scales, from global to local, and
specifically, one that interrogates the links between scales.
