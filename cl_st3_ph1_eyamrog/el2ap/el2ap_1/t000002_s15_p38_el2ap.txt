In this following extract (3), students had just read the
brief text about particle theory, and they were answering handout
questions collectively. During the interactions, the teacher generally accepted responses
including things like ‘separate’, ‘get further away from each other’,
and ‘move faster’. She also explicitly asked for two other
‘things’ (lines 50 and 53) whereby she readily obtained ‘energy’
and ‘freely’. The teacher seemingly aimed to find in students’
voices some keywords from the text. With these expected answers
at hand (or their synonyms), the teacher provided the entire
explanation in the last line. Again, these questions were not
coded as dialogic (lines 50, 53, and 55) because expected
answers were in the handout; students were merely reproducing them
aloud and, as line 56 shows, hesitantly. It might the
said that students’ text comprehension was explored, but it is
harder to say that explanations were explored.
