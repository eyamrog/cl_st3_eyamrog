Finally, future research could use the inputs of this study
to elaborate a contextual scale of teacher emotional regulation and
examine the phenomenon in a more extensive and more diverse
sample using quantitative methods. In addition, other techniques such as
behavioral observation and diaries and others that consider the dynamic
process of regulation to better understand teachers' contextual emotion regulation
could be used. Finally, one can also investigate the reasons
that lead teachers to regulate their emotions and the outcomes
in terms of mental health.
