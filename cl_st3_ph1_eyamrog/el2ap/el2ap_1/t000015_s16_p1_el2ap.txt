The JUOJS employ an optional PKP Beacon, released with the
software in 2015, that enables PKP to notify OJS users
of security patches and other software upgrades.8 The beacon also
transmits indexing information about the journal, including the journal’s title,
ISSN, number of items published, titles, and abstracts. This study
employed a standard for “active” journals of five items a
year, set by the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ,
2020).9 The resulting publicly available data set for 2020 was
25,671 journals or 36.5% of the 70,214 OJS beacons operating
at the time (Khanna et al., 2021). The growth in
journals using OJS over the previous decade has shown signs
of increasing (Figure 1). The journals in the data set
averaged 38.1 items in 2020, for a total of 996,000
items, while these journals have published a total 5.4 million
items since their inception. An OJS installation, from which multiple
journals can be generated, is host to 2.62 active journals
on average.
