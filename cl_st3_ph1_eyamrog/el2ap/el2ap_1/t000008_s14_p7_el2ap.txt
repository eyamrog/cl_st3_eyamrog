A completely randomized factorial experimental design was used with 2
storage conditions (non-stored and stored pyrenes) x 6 pretreatments (control;
~25°C - 24h, 48h, and 72h; and in hot water
at 75°C for 5 and 10 min) with four replicates
of 25 pyrenes (=100 individual pyrenes) were used for each
treatment and control.
