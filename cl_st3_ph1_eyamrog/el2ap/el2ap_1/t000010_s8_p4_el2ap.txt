Although these solutions exist, some authors recognize that the variability
of neuropsychological tests in the pediatric population is more complex
than thought. Solovieva et al., (2021), highlight that sociocultural factors
have been identified as determinants to explain the variability of
neuropsychological development, while other reviews highlight the effect on psychometric
intelligence (Rea-Sandin et al., 2021).
