These elements can be observed when the characteristics of each
subtest are specifically analyzed. In the matrices subtest, the child
must search, among four alternative solutions, one to complete the
abstract figure, thus forcing him to search for the appropriate
alternative using higher cognitive skills that also demand executive functions.
In this subtest the child has to use higher cognitive
skills such as size perception, perception of orientation in space,
in one direction and in two directions simultaneously, analyze the
figure as a whole and its parts, conceive correlative figures
and deduction of relationships (Gizzonio et al., 2021).
