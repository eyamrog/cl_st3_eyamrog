Europeans were not willing to cross the Atlantic in large
numbers to provide cheap labour, and so the Portuguese started
using the local indigenous population as slave labour and also
to import slaves from the African continent, principally from West
Central Africa (SLAVE VOYAGES, 2021). The African slaves gradually replaced
indigenous workforce, which had also been submitted to slavery, after
large numbers of this population died as a result of
epidemics (MARQUESE, 2006). It is difficult to establish the number
of Africans brought to Brazil during the three centuries of
slave traffic until 1888, when slavery was abolished, but estimates
speak of around 6 million people (SLAVE VOYAGES, 2021).
