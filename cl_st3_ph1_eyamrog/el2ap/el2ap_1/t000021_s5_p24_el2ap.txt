Another possible explanation may be in the pedagogical training received,
which, although generally reported as ineffective by most teachers, can
somehow offer resources to face the demands of the classroom
(TAXER; GROSS, 2018). In this regard, teachers in the technical
area seem to be more likely to report problems because
most are trained in engineering and technology fields, which has
traditionally paid less attention to pedagogical aspects of teaching.
