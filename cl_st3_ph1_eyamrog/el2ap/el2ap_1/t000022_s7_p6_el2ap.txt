Furthermore, there are thousands of journals that do not have
metadata at the document level. This affects the possibility of
analyzing the production published in Latindex journals which continues to
be, as Miguel already observed in 2011, the cataloging database
with the greatest coverage. In addition, there is no standardization
of institutional affiliations, nor of the disciplinary classification of journals;
nor is the use of unique identifiers of authors and
institutions such as ORCID and ROR sufficiently widespread among the
different databases. All these further limit studies at the document
level. Consequently, this large corpus of documents published in the
region is observed from fragmented approaches.
