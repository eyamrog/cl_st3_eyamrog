The six other teams included a mix of adult players,
originating from different districts of Timor-Leste. In these football clubs,
members were represented as having a shared national identity, as
Timorese. When we interviewed the two organisers of the Ramkabian
club, they explained that they had created a name that
included parts of the names of three different mountains in
Timor-Leste: Ramelau, Kablake and Matebian. They had done this as
a way of emphasising inclusivity, dealing with difference and the
building of solidarity. One of the organisers outlined the aims
of the club. Blending Portuguese with Tetum as he spoke,
he pointed out that one of the aims was: “Criar
amizade que [é] forte, la’os ba iha ne’é deit maibé
iha fatin hotu-hotu” (Creating friendship that is strong, not only
for this [club] but everywhere). (Interview with both RS and
HA, June 7, 2015 – all Portuguese words are shown
in italics). FC Lao Rai United was also represented in
a similar way. One of the organisers said that he
saw the football club and participation in tournaments as giving
an opportunity for Timorese from different districts of Timor-Leste to
get to know one another. The use of the term
Lao Rai (Travellers) in the name of this club indexed
the shared identity of the players as people on the
move. A third club, AS Bidau also had an inclusive
ethos. The name, AS Bidau, refers to a linguistically diverse
neighbourhood of Dili. The players in this team had mixed
language backgrounds.
