In Brazil, a continental developing country that is just starting
the internationalization process of universities and where there barely are
academic writing courses to help students in this task, online
EAP/CEAP courses may represent the only opportunity for these novice
researchers to develop their academic writing skills. However, the design
of such courses may be a big challenge for teachers
and course developers, due to social, cultural, ideological, and economic
discrepancies among different regions of the country. To assure the
specificity ESP pedagogy advocates for, present and target situation analysis
must also investigate contextual issues regarding discursive practices in the
target discourse community in each region where students are from.
Carrying out this investigation in locus, in this case, may
be time- and resource-demanding. Contextual TSA at a distance, then,
appears as the best solution to assure specificity, criticism, and
praxis for the design of courses that fully attend to
studentsâ€™ needs and wants with fewer investments, which is only
possible thanks to ICT.
