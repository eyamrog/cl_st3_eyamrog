Initial preparation for a community-wide discussion about ethics and informed
consent took place on July 14, 2012 in a meeting
with two community members who were also the school teachers
in Arena Blanca at the time and who had agreed
to act as translators for the meeting. A clear outcome
of the meeting with the schoolteachers was the realization that
the concept of archiving was likely to be difficult for
the outside linguist to explain in ways that would be
clearly understood due to the complexity of some of the
concepts and technicalities behind them. Of significant concern was the
fact that, at the time, there was no connectivity for
the Internet or phones, there were no computers in the
community, and both the teachers had limited experience with this
technology.
