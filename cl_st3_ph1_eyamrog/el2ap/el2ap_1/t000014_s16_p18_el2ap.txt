Discussions of ethics and ethical best practices have figured prominently
in the language documentation literature. In these discussions, particular attention
has been paid to collaboration (GLENN, 2009; LEONARD and HAYNES,
2010), community involvement and engagement (YAMADA, 2007; CZAYKOWSKA-HIGGINS, 2009; SAPIÉN,
2018; BISCHOFF and JANY, 2018), and the applicability of ethical
models to different parts of the world (DOBRIN, 2008; HOLTON,
2009; PÉREZ BÁEZ, ROGERS and ROSÉS LABRADA, 2016). The intersection
of archiving and ethics has also received considerable attention (e.g.,
Macri and Sarmento 2010 and Innes 2010, both of whom
explored ethical issues related to archives). In these discussions, informed
consent has played a key role, with multiple researchers questioning
how ‘informed’ the consent really is (GRINEVALD, 2006; ROBINSON, 2010).
An overview of some of the issues relating to informed
consent may be found in Dwyer (2006, p. 43-48).
