Here we describe and demonstrate a modern approach for producing
a bacterial genome assembly with the goal of perfection using
a combination of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long reads and
Illumina short reads (Figure 1). These platforms were chosen for
their availability and widespread adoption in microbial genomics. While older
hybrid assembly methods have used a short- read-first approach (building
a short-read assembly graph and then scaffolding with long reads)4,
improvements in the yield and accuracy of long-read sequencing now
mean that long-read-first hybrid assembly (making a long-read-only assembly and
then polishing with short reads) can produce more accurate results5,
and that is the approach we use in this manuscript.
We also provide an online tutorial (github.com/rrwick/perfect-bacterial-genome-tutorial) with sample data
(hybrid sequencing of Staphylococcus aureus strain JKD61596) so readers can
try this method for themselves.
