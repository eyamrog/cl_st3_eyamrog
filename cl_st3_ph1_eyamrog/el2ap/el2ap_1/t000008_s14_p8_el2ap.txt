Data analysis - Germination variables (G%, MGT, and speed index)
were evaluated using analysis of variance with permutations (10,000 iterations)
with the lmPerm package (Wheeler & Torchiano 2016) in R
statistical software (R Core Team 2020). Models compared variable values
as a function of water immersion treatments (control, soaking in
water for 24, 48, and 72h, hot water for 5
and 10 min), storage period (freshly harvested and stored pyrenes),
and the interaction between them (see Supplementary material table S1).
The analyses were followed by Tukey HSD tests to address
multiple comparisons among all treatment combinations.
