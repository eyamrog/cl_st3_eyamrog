More recently, review books on methods for analysing classroom dialogue
have been published (Kershner, Hennessy, et al., 2020; Kumpulainen et
al., 2009; MÃ¤rtsin, 2012). Contributing to this proliferating field of
research, the proposal of this discussion paper is to reflect
on the methodologies and methods to analyse classroom discursive interaction.
However, instead of directly departing to analytical methods, it is
firstly offered a broad methodological discussion starting from research paradigms
that considers elements such as epistemology and ontology. In the
second part of this paper, methods and procedures for discursive
data analysis are presented in two veins: quantitative and qualitative
approaches. Both methods are discussed and illustrated based on examples
from previous research.
