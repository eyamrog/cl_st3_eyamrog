The fracture toughness of mature leaves of A. crucigerum (average
206 Â±SD 53 Jm-2) was at least three times lower
than the values found for mature leaves of other dicotyledonous
species (Lucas & Pereira 1990) but similar to that found
for Piper kadzura, Morus australis and Trema orientalis (Hill &
Lucas 1996). The lower toughness can occur due to the
difference in leaf anatomy and thickness. The fracture toughness increases
with the leaf thickness and percentage of fibers, but decreases
with the greatest contribution of parenchyma cells in the mesophyll
(Vincent 1990a, Lucas et al. 1995, Darvell et al. 1996).
In our case, the leaf lamina of A crucigerum is
thin and predominantly composed of parenchyma cells, as can be
seen in figure 1, which probably contributed to the lowest
toughness in this liana.
