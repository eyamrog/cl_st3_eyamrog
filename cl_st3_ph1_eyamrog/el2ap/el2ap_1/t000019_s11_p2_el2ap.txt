Feenberg (2003) explains that, in modern society, technology is advancing
as something that is free from previous values, and so,
serves as a means to achieve human goals. For this
author, this is an instrumental conception of technology, as it
reduces it to the dimension of just a tool under
human control. In this perspective, for example, bombs would not
be intended to destroy, because that would be a human
decision.
