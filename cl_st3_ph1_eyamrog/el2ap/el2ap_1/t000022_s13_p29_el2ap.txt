Letâ€™s move on now to language trends. In contrast to
the highly predominant role of English widely seen in mainstream
databases, the OLIVA corpus is characterized by a remarkable linguistic
diversity, driven by the infrastructure developed in the region with
multilingual indexing and publishing protocols and infrastructures. Table 4 shows
the central role of Spanish and Portuguese, but also a
significant presence of English which represents 23.9% of the articles.
French has a very limited presence, as do other languages,
some of which appear only once. Portuguese, logically, is found
mainly in journals published in Brazil. It is interesting to
note that 62.4% of the articles in journals of Brazil
were published in Portuguese, while English represents one-third (34.6%). This
value is only comparable to the percentage of English in
articles in journals of Puerto Rico (50.5%), Chile (23.7%) and
Mexico (17.1%). In the case of Chile, it might be
one more element pointing to an academic culture more influenced
by mainstream standards. In the case of Mexico and Puerto
Rico, it may be influenced by traditional academic ties.
