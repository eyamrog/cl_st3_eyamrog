Although the origin of these discrepancies is unclear, it is
possible to assume that there are cultural and contextual influences
on regulation (e.g., SUTTON, 2004). For example, the studies mentioned
above were conducted with elementary and high school teachers from
Croatia and the USA (e.g., BURIÄ† et al., 2016; SUTTON,
2004; TAXER; GROSS, 2018), except the study by Akbari et
al. ( 2017), conducted with Iranian teachers who taught foreign
language. This study, in turn, focused on teachers of vocational
and technological education in a specific region of Brazil. In
addition, the present study expanded the situational factors investigated, whereas
previous studies focused primarily on the student's inappropriate behavior. Thus,
certain situations trigger specific emotions and strategies (Table 1). Additionally,
personal factors related to the area of training/career level also
seem to affect strategy selection (FRIED et al., 2015). Next,
the families of strategies are broadly discussed according to their
salience.
