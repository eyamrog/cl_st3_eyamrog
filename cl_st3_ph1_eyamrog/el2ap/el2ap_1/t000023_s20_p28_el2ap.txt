Note: Specimens studied varied in several morphological features. Cell shape
varied from pyramidal to slight trapezoid, basal angles from sometimes
wide concave to straight, and the apex from rounded to
truncate to slightly sharp. According to Bortolini et al. (2010),
this species displays some great morphological variation, a fact that
was also observed during the present study.
