Both projects allowed for high quality equipment to be purchased
for the Paresi and Enawene Nawe via financial support from
the ELDP/SOAS. This equipment included a Zoom digital recorder, Shure
head microphones, a digital video camera, an external microphone for
the camcorder, a tripod, and other materials. Various cultural and
speech events were documented throughout the projects. The Paresi communities
selected traditional stories, songs, blessings, traditional festivals, indigenous games, etc.
for documentation, and we also recorded different dialects or varieties
of the Paresi language. The EN preferred to focus on
recording traditional stories (e.g. their origin story, the account of
the origin of cassava, a story about spirits, and others).
