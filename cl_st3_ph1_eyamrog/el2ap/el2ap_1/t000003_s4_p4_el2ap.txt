Fourth, the dual focus on mobility and on the processes
and practices involved in mooring makes it possible to counter-balance
accounts of detachment, dislocation and precarious positioning in migration studies
with vivid and revealing insights into the situated ways in
which moorings (and re-moorings) occur, foregrounding the agency of those
involved. In addition, close attention to the linguistic, cultural and
other semiotic practices of specific groups, such as the football
clubs we have discussed here, enables us to build an
understanding of the complex ways in which local forms of
mooring activity come to be imbued with multi-layered social meanings.
