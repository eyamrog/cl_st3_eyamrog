Opportunism is a common behavior between bird species. For example,
caracaras (Falconidae) consume a myriad of types of resources, such
as fruits, carcasses and eventually arthropods. These birds have been
seen interacting with a diverse group of mammals, which raises
the idea that they can have a central role in
the community network. The caracaras are not only generalists in
consumption, but also generalists in interactions with different host species.
But, caracaras are an exception to the average opportunistic behavior
in cleaning interactions, considering that there is no significant correlation
between centrality degree and diversity of diet. The absence of
a significant correlation suggests that there is more than one
dimension when referring to generalism and specialism behaviors. Indeed, there
are different levels of organization that can shape the biodiversity
patterns (Levin, 1992). Some cleaner birds are generalists in the
networks, when considering the different species of hosts, but in
a broader perspective of consumption they are specialized. Some species,
like the Oxpeckers (Buphagus sp.), specialized in cleaning interactions, in
a way that they consume only parasites that live in
large mammals. They are central to the network, demonstrating generalistic
associations between different species of mammals, but specialized in consuming
small arthropods that live in these mammals. Although these parasites
can have a range of differences in morphologies and physiologies,
compared to other categories of food resources the Oxpeckers can
be defined as a specialist in consumption. Which means that
the opportunistic behavior, although being essential to engagement in facultative
interactions, can lead to specialized behavior. A strategy that can
lead to an intimate relationship between the cleaners and even
some of their most frequent hosts.
