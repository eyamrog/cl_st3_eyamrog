After basecalling, QC filtering can improve the quality of the
ONT reads. We recommend using Filtlong15 to remove the worst
reads (short length and low accuracy) with --keep_percent 90. If
the read set has a poor N50 but is very
deep, then removing short reads (e.g. <5 kbp) can help
with assembly, though this may compromise small plasmid recovery (see
Pitfalls).
