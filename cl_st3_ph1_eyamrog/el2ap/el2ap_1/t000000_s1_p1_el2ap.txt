(Fern flora of Viçosa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil: Dennstaedtiaceae, Lindsaeaceae
and Saccolomataceae). As part of an ongoing project treating the
ferns and lycophytes from the region of Viçosa, Minas Gerais
State, Brazil, we here present the taxonomic treatment of the
early divergent lineages of the leptosporangiate ferns: the families Dennstaedtiaceae,
Lindsaeaceae and Saccolomataceae. We have been sampling the remnant forest
patches since 2012; we also fully reviewed the collection of
herbarium VIC and other online collections: F, IAN, NY, PH,
RB, U, UC, UPCB, US, and WTU. In the region
of Viçosa, six taxa belonging to those families occur Dennstaedtia
cicutaria and Pteridium esculentum subsp. arachnoideum (Dennstaedtiaceae); Lindsaea lancea var.
lancea, L. quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis, and L. stricta var. stricta
(Lindsaeaceae); and Saccoloma elegans (Saccolomataceae). Among these taxa, only L.
quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis and S. elegans are endemic to the
Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest; the remaining are widespread in the Neotropics.
We present keys, descriptions, illustrations, examined specimens, and comments.
