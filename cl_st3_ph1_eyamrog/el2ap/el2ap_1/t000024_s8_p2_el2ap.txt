Among the epiphytes, studies have reported that Bromeliaceae species are
fundamental to their native ecosystem and feasible for relocation (Jasper
et al. 2005, Duarte & Gandolfi 2013) presenting ecological importance.
Some morphological characteristics of certain bromeliads, such as the overlap
of leaf bases forming a cistern or phytotelmata, can serve
as a shelter and storage of water and nutrients available
for small animals (Benzing 2000). According to Stuntz et al.
(2002), the evaporation of water stored in bromeliad cisterns, for
example, can change the behaviour and niche distribution of the
tree fauna, influencing the microclimate conditions of the canopy by
enabling lower temperatures in its vicinity. Also, bromeliads offer other
resources such as flowers, fruits and nectar to the natural
environment (Benzing 2004, Cestari 2009).
