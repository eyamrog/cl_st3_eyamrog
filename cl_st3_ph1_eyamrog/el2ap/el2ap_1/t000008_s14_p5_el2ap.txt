Prior the experiments were set, two replicates of 15 stored
pyrenes were used to estimate the water content (Brasil 2009)
(see seed collection and benefiting subsection). Pretreatments by soaking the
pyrenes in water (see Germination of pretreated pyrenes) were also
applied to the stored pyrenes, before the germination tests, compared
to a control (untreated/non-soaked stored pyrenes) under laboratory conditions. Then,
stored pyrenes (pretreated and untreated) were set to germinate in
rolls of germitestÂ® paper as described above.
