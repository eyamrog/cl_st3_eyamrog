Undoubtedly, this interview is more sensitive for subjects with severe
or moderate neurological damage than for a subject with a
slight alteration, therefore, Luria elaborated tasks specifically for each mental
process in order to deepen and specify the defect. It
is appropriate to recognize that in Luria's method two essential
elements of the assessment can be observed: observing and analyzing
activities of daily living; and using specific tasks to verify
and specify the defect (16). However, Luria conceived the assessment
for the brain-damaged adult population and not for the child
population. In this sense, Mangas and Ramos (30), Solovieva and
collaborators (31), made an adaptation of Luria's proposal to be
applied in preschool children.
