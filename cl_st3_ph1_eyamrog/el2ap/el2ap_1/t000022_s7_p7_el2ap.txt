It is in this context that the OLIVA project (Latin
American Observatory of eVAluation Indicators4) emerged as an initiative of
the Centro de Estudios de la Circulación del Conocimiento (CECIC-Facultad
de Ciencias Políticas y Sociales), which was approved and funded
in early 2019 by the Universidad Nacional de Cuyo. The
main purpose of this project is to give visibility to
the richness of this scientific production published in the region,
and to develop indicators to recognize the value of these
journals for the assessment of individual careers and academic institutions.
For the first phase of the project, the SciELO/FAPESP Program
of Brazil, Redalyc (at the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de
México -UAEM Mexico), and the Consejo Latinoamericano de Ciencias Sociales
(CLACSO) were invited to collaborate. The results of this first
phase of the project are presented in this paper. The
second phase foresees the incorporation of documents from journals indexed
in Latindex Catalog 2.0 and in Biblat. A pilot is
already underway with these institutions.
