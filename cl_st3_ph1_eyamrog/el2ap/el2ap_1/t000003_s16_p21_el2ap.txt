There are different groups of Timorese, with particular interests, who
have formed particular communities of practice. There is, for example
a choir that sings once a month in the Catholic
Church. There is also a traditional womenâ€™s dance troupe. However,
in this section of the paper, we focus on one
particular (all male) community of practice that we encountered during
our research: One that has developed out of a keen
interest in football.
