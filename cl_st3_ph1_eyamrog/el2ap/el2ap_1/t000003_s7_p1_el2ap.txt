This paper draws on research, of a sociolinguistic ethnographic nature,
conducted with young migrant workers from Timor-Leste based in a
small town in Northern Ireland (CABRAL; MARTIN-JONES, 2017). The overall
aims of this research were: (1.) to build an account
of the life histories of a small sample of these
young Timorese, taking account of their education and prior work
experience in Timor-Leste and their migration trajectories from Timor- Leste
to Northern Ireland (via Portugal or England); (2.) to document
the ways in which they were dealing with the local
conditions of settlement and employment; (3.) to gain insight into
the agentive ways in which they were creating new spaces
of solidarity and conviviality within local life worlds, and (4.)
to focus on the ways in which they were drawing
on different linguistic, cultural and semiotic resources (including Portuguese) as
they built new transnational and transcultural identities within local life
worlds.
