Although these strategies are topographically distinct, they have the function
of adjusting cognition to circumstances and emotional goals to reduce
contradictions and dissonances. They change teachers' attitudes towards the events
(CLARÀ, 2017) to reduce the emotional impact and influence on
their behaviors. For example, teachers can become involved in the
change process when putting themselves in the student's place. Likewise,
positive reevaluation can bring teachers and students closer together. Thus,
knowing and understanding the students' context can stimulate teacher empathy,
engagement, and flexibility. This helps to challenge negative stereotypes (AKBARI
et al., 2017; CHANG; DAVES, 2009; CROSS; HONG, 2012), promotes
a more positive perception of the teacher-student relationship (CLARÀ, 2017),
and stimulates helping behaviors (GROSS, 2014). These considerations are consonant
with evidence that cognitive modification is related to positive emotions,
better relationships, and teacher well- being (CHANG, 2013; CLARÀ, 2017).
