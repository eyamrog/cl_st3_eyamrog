From our participant observation and our interviews, and from earlier
research in Dungannon by Da Costa Cabral (2010), it is
becoming clear that there is considerable diversity among the young
Timorese currently living and working in Dungannon and Cookstown. They
come from different districts of Timor-Leste and they speak different
regional languages4 (e.g. Fataluku, Makasai and Mambai), as well as
Tetum, the primary lingua franca. Table 1 below shows the
language resources and the migration trajectories of those within the
core group of research participants. Since all the core group
interviewees were between the ages of 20 and 45, they
had all received their education, either solely or partly, through
the medium of Bahasa Indonesia5.
