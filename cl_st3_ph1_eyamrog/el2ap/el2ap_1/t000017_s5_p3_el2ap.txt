Internal structure validity remains appropriate in both the previous version
of the B- PREA, as well as in the revised
version. The factor analysis presented three factors in the previous
version (Numerical Cognitive Processing Skills, Executive Skills and Linguistic Skills),
while the revised version confirmed three factors (Executive Skills, Memory
Skills and Linguistic Skills). In factor 1 "Executive Skills" five
subtests were grouped (visual selective attention, matrices, story comprehension, graphomotor
skills and counting quantities), which contain several skills and actions
of the stage, and are congruent with theoretical models of
executive functions (Doebel, 2020; Zelazo, 2020).
