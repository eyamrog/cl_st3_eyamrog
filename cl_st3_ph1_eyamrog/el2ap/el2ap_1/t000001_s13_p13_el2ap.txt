The previous steps have generated a long-read-only assembly of maximal
accuracy, likely ~Q50 (one error per 100 kbp) if R10.4.1
ONT reads were used. The final step is to repair
any remaining errors with short reads. For example, long homopolymers
can be difficult for ONT sequencing to resolve14, but Illumina
sequencing does not suffer from this problem12,29, so homopolymer-length errors
which persist after long-read polishing can be fixed by short-read
polishing.
