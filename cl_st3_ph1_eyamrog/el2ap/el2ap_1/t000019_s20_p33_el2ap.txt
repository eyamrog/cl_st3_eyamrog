As for the general population, access to knowledge in DICT
has not evolved as it remains outside the formal instruction
in public schools with their lack of technological and human
resources, and so are, justifiably, unable to implement it. The
social classes that most need this learning at school, classes
D and E are the poorest and if they want
to learn basic computing, they need to pay for this
training in other private spaces, as the public telecenters are
also in precarious situations as described above. This situation means
they only have a very basic routine knowledge of these
tools, if even this.
