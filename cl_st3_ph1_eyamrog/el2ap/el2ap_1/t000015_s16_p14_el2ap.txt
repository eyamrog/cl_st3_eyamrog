The visibility and circulation of the JUOJS were assessed by
determining the presence of these journals in 11 research indexes,
directories, and lists. The analysis of the Web of Science
Citation Reports and Cabells Predatory Reports involved drawing on Stanford
University Library licensing agreements, with Cabells kindly determining the JUOJS
in its database, based on its use of our data
set. EBSCOHost, Scopus, OpenAlex, DOAJ, and Beall’s List make their
respective journal lists publicly available. Bianca Kramer ascertained the number
of JUOJS in ROAD (2022), while SerpApi generously assisted in
assessing Google Scholar’s indexing of JUOJS. With each of the
indexes, we then assess how well JUOJS are represented in
the index by assessing overlap based on matched ISSNs, and/or
matched journal URLs and domain names. The specific matching criteria
used for each resource are also reported with Table 3.
