The use of ICT in Phase 2 was also substantial
for investigating critical issues at a distance. Firstly, it made
it possible to perpetuate research practices that are typical in
face-to-face interviews, such as audio and video recording, thanks to
a lot of software that is freely available on the
web. Besides, sharing the screen with the participants in Part
1 was central to assuring the second-person perspective for data
gathering; moreover, it turned out to be a better procedure
than the printed version. Once the participant has a full
view of the array on the screen, s/he can more
clearly accompany the data inserted in the array by the
researcher and comment/correct them instantaneously without needing to erase the
paper, and the researcher ends the interview with the data
already tabulated in digital version and ready to be analyzed.
