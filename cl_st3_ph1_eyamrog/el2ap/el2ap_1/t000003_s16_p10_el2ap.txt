Two of those we interviewed in June 2015 (RS and
HA) had been among the very first groups to arrive
in Dungannon, in 2001 and 2002, directly from Portugal. They
had found work through an employment agency in Portugal (Interviews,
June 2015). Another interviewee (MFB) had worked in England before
moving over to Northern Ireland and had therefore had prior
exposure to English in the workplace (Interview with MFB, June
2015).
