The Low Doce River region is undergoing severe urban and
rural anthropogenic interference mainly represented by livestock, agriculture and the
increasing industrialization (Barroso et al. 2012) even before the Fundão
dam failure in 2015. Dam rupture released downstream about 43
million m³ (Carmo et al. 2017) of mining tailings, causing
several changes on the fluvial system, such as erosion, degradation,
and iron (Fe) enrichment to potentially impactful levels (Hatje et
al. 2017). Lack of floristic studies in the region and
the fact that mine tailing inputs have previously caused taxonomic
and functional changes in several communities, such as the benthic
fauna (Burd 2002), marine macroalgal flora (Correa et al. 1999),
planktonic algae (Salonen et al. 2006), and benthic algal communities
(Lavoie et al. 2012), highlights the importance of periphyton biodiversity
studies in the region.
