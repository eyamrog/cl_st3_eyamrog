Biomechanical structure - On average, the structural Young’s modulus in
stems kept moist is similar over time (Fdf(59) = 0.001;
P = 0.96; figure 2 a), with a value around
4360 ± SD 316 MNm−2 and the median close to
4331 MNm−2, while stems undergoing gradual dehydration increased structural Young’s
modulus over time (Fdf(59) = 21.54; P < 0.001; figure
2 b; Supplementary material table S1). Indeed, relative water content
decreased exponentially with time in stem undergoing gradual dehydration (Fdf(59)
= 215.3; P < 0.001; figure 2 c; Supplementary material
table S2) and structural Young’s modulus showed a negative exponential
relationship with stem relative water content (Fdf(59) = 11.46; P
= 0.001; figure 3; Supplementary material table S3). For example,
at 12 % moisture content, the structural Young’s modulus of
the stem in A. crucigerum is on average 4500 MNm-2.
With 24 % moisture content, the structural Young’s modulus is
4400 MNm-2, a reduction of 4 % in bending stiffness.
Shortly after collection, the structural Young’s modulus is about 4034
MNm-2 in stems under gradual dehydration condition, maintaining approximately this
value during the first 12 hours (figure 2 b) and
up to 80 % of moisture content (figure 3 a).
