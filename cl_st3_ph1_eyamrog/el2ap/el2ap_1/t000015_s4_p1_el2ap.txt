This paper does not answer the question of how many
journals there are in the world. It establishes, however, that
the several estimates of 30,000, noted above, fall woefully short.
Scholarly publishing is taking place on far more of a
global scale than is commonly recognized in such estimates, as
well as in studies that rely on the Web of
Science Citation Index and Scopus. Dismissing this global scale out
of hand, as too much research or predatory publishing, seems
a less than scientific approach. Rather, there are grounds for
beginning to recalibrate scholarly communication on a decidedly expanded, but
no less rigorous, scale. This can only help the world
take advantage of a yet to be fully grasped growth
of the research enterprise. This growth is about more than
journal counts. It concerns significant bibliodiversity in scholarly communication reflected,
in this case, by the 60 languages in which research
is published from 136 countries. It involves changes in scholarly
communication economics. There are open source alternatives to corporate domination
of publishing services relied upon by profit and non-profit publishers.19
The open source platform investigated in this study can be
said, for example, to be driving an OA diamond model
of equitable access for authors, users, and readers across the
full range of academic disciplines.20
