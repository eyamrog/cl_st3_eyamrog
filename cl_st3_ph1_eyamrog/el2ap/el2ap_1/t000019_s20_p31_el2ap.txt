The presence of a motivating individual in the laboratories, in
a way, generated security for the teacher regarding the technical
environment of the laboratory and its possible complications, in addition
to supporting the development of content, the selection of tools,
etc. The role of this professional should have been more
directed to the pedagogical area and not exclude the presence
of a technician in the school, since the latter is
technical support and the former should be specialized support in
the pedagogical use of DICT. Currently, the presence of this
motivator is almost non-existent in public schools (Brito, 2008). There
is also no computer technician per school.
