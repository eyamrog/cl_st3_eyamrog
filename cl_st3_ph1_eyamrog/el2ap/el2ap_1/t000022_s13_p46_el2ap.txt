Let us consider in detail, the case of authors affiliated
with institutions in the Northeast region. Table 6 shows the
nine states of the region, and the types of collaboration
of authors from each of the states with authors from
the same or other states and regions in Brazil. First
of all, there is a considerable tendency (just over 40%)
to collaborate with other authors from the same state. However,
the collaboration amongst the states of the region and the
five most productive states (states with the most documents) as
mentioned previously - São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro,
Rio Grande do Sul and Paraná - is split approximately
equally. The total co-authorship with authors in the remaining thirteen
states ranges between 7.7% and 12.7%. In other words, the
collaboration “outside state borders”/between states takes place with the same
degree of intensity between states in the same region as
it does between these same states and the five major
centers of scientific production. Of course, this trend is complemented
by the modest role of the other states in within-state
collaboration.
