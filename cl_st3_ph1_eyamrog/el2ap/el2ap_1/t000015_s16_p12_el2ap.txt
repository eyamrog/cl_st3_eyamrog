The disciplinary distribution of journals reveals that social science research
is the leading area among journals, although the STEM fields
– led by the medical and health sciences, followed by
engineering and technology – also play a major role by
journal count (Figure 8). The STEM presence is notable where
the expectation is that research conducted beyond the center represents
a degree of cultural diversity that will occupy the main
body of research activity (Figure 9). Where the social sciences
and humanities are assumed to have a local significance that
can be well served by researchers on site, the “universality”
of the sciences frees them up for gravitating toward the
center, with these results suggesting a more distributed basis for
research in the sciences, technologies, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).
