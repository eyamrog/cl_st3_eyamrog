A second issue that came up was the question of
access for community members and a distinction between those “who
know” – meaning those who know how to use computers
and the Internet – versus those “who don’t know.” The
general consensus was that those who knew could potentially go
to the Internet and use these archived materials but that
for those who did not know, making copies in DVDs
and CDs was needed. A third issue concerned the content
of the recordings themselves; a community member expressed a preoccupation
regarding recordings that may contain crude jokes or curse words
and who could listen. For these, it did not seem
to be a problem that people in other parts of
the world could listen to these recordings. Rather, this particular
community member was concerned about the potential reactions of Mako
people from other nearby villages who might listen and not
understand that these jokes were truly meant in jest. Finally,
there was discussion of videos of traditional activities as being
harmless, when compared to some other videos that the community
was aware of, such as violent movies. This provided an
opportunity to explain further that individual speakers had agency to
restrict access both at the time of recording but also
into the future, and that specific access provisions could be
enabled and changed at any time in the future. Overall,
this discussion reassured Rosés Labrada that community members in Arena
Blanca had a clearer understanding – when compared to the
initial meeting in July 2012 – of some of the
ethical issues around informed consent, archiving and access.
