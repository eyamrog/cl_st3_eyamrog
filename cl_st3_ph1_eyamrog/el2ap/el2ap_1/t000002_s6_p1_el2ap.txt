In this paper, we have discussed two research paradigms and
related them to two methodological approaches to analysing educational dialogue;
systematic coding (positivism-quantitative) and sociocultural discourse analysis (interpretivism-qualitative). The first
consisted of a coding scheme in which utterances were allocated
to predefined categories that can be broadened or broken down
further as desired. Hennessy et al. (2020) list some advantages
of frequency counting, such as processing large quantities of data,
highlighting key markers, searching the dataset efficiently to find how
specific acts correlate with others, detecting patterns, measuring change in
practice and making comparisons subjected to statistical analysis.
