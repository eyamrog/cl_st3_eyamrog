It is well known that the effect of dehydration of
stem and leaves increases the stiffness and toughness of these
organs in self-supporting species (Boldrin et al. 2018, Caliaro et
al. 2013, Niklas 1992). In addition, to avoid dehydration in
plant structures of fresh samples, such as stems, roots and
leaves, they are generally taken to the laboratory for biomechanical
tests right after collection (Gallenmüller et al. 2004). Experimental evidence
showing the size of the effect of dehydration on biomechanical
properties is rare, and in lianas it has never been
done. Lianas (wood climbers) are important and intriguing forest components
in the tropics worldwide, accounting for about 25% of woody
stem species diversity (Gentry 1991, Schnitzer & Bongers 2011), playing
an essential role in forest dynamics (Schnitzer & Bongers 2002),
and as food and canopy pathways for animals (Putz &
Mooney 1991). In disturbed areas and forest edges, liana stems
are abundant, and their stems are usually thin and flexible,
forming dense liana tangles (Schnitzer & Bongers 2011). Lianas have
unique stem anatomies, related to highly flexible stems, often with
abundant parenchymatous tissue that helps torsion and resist damage after
injuries (Rowe et al. 2004, Read & Stokes 2006, Rocha
et al. 2020). We hypothesized that fresh liana stem and
leaf samples kept moist will retain its original bending stiffness
and fracture toughness of the stems and leaves, respectively, while
gradual dehydration of samples exposed to air will increase stiffness
and toughness a few hours. To explore this knowledge gap,
we chose one liana species as a model to test
whether: (i) stem structural Young’s modulus and leaf fracture toughness
increase during gradual dehydration of the samples over time, and
(ii) how long stems and leaves maintain constant biomechanical properties
after field sampling.
