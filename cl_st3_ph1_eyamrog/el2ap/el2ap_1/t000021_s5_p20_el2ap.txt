The acting out reaction refers to the loss of emotional
control (such as the use of offensive language and aggression)
(NELIS et al., 2011) in the face of hostile behavior
and threats from students, which activate anger and impotence in
the teacher (CHANG; DEVIS, 2009). According to Taxer and Frenzel
(2015), the expression of anger is counterproductive because it impairs
the relationship with students. In this sense, there was a
consensus that impulsive reactions are dysfunctional and might hurt the
idealized image of the profession (SUTTON, 2004; SUTTON et al.,
2009).
