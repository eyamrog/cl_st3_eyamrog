One key consideration for ONT sequencing is depth: how deep
must the ONT read set be? High read depth aids
both assembly (allowing for more independent read sets in Trycycler,
see Step 3) and polishing (yielding higher accuracy, see Step
4). When aiming for a perfect assembly, consider 100× depth
to be a minimum, with 200× being ideal. Depths above
200× are better but will give diminishing returns. Using a
single ONT flow cell for one bacterial isolate may provide
excessive depth, so multiplexing is common in microbial genomics. This
is not a problem for assembly, though barcode leakage should
be considered (see Pitfalls).
