Archives have tended to increase their holdings with the proactive
donations of living individuals (often academic researchers), or with bequeathments
from the estates of deceased individuals. However, the reach of
archives can be broadened and enriched beyond this model in
a number of ways. As is becoming more common, speakers
and other indigenous collaborators can contribute directly, as well as
indirectly, to the archival process, as we addressed in ยง4.
Moreover, as we explore here, researchers, community members, and archive
staff can be proactive in locating and preserving legacy materials,
a process that itself can involve collaboration among many stakeholders.
In this section, we consider practical considerations in locating and
archiving legacy materials, that is, written or audiovisual materials collected
in the past, usually before digital recording and archiving methods
were available (ยง5.1) and in making use of them (ยง5.2).
