As early as 1998, Ann María Cetto and Octavio Alonso-Gamboa,
at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), raised the
marginalization of Global South research in the principal journal indexes
(Cetto & Alonso-Gamboa, 1998). They found that the Web of
Science’s coverage of scholarly publishing in Latin America and the
Caribbean amounted to 0.5% of the journals indexed (p. 114).
Cetto and Alonso-Gamboa were inspired to join forces with others
in the region to form Latindex in 1997, which currently
indexes 24,486 journals, as a way of countering what had
otherwise been constructed, in Cetto’s words, as “the large periphery
of the present world system” (1997, p. 40).14
