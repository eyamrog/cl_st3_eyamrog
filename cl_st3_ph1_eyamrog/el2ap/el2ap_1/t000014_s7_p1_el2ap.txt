As more and more of the world’s languages become endangered,
their documentation provides key resources for scholars and communities. Documentary
materials provide an empirical basis to inform our knowledge about
what is possible in human language, a register of diverse
cultural and discursive traditions, and a tangible record of community
heritage, offering future generations access to the voices of their
parents and grandparents. Yet these materials tend to be fragile
and ephemeral. Audio and video cassettes break down, notebooks mildew
and fade, and even SD cards and hard drives are
susceptible to fire, flood, and changing technologies – as underscored
by tragic events like the 2018 fire in Brazil’s Museu
Nacional, in which countless precious recordings and manuscripts were lost.
More and more, linguists and others look to digital archives
as an essential resource in ensuring the preservation of and
access to the outcomes of language documentation work.
