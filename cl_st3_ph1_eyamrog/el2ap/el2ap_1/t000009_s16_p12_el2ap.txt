After the interviews were finished, they were transcribed using ELAN,
software for audio and video transcription. Data analysis was based
on a six-step methodology for content analysis, proposed by Huckin
(2004), in which, after defining the unities of analysis, data
must be tabulated for interpretation. There were over eight hours
of transcribed data; therefore, AntCon – software for text analysis
– was used to optimize the work.
