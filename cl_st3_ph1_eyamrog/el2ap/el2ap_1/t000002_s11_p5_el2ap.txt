In more detail, positivist research “strives for objectivity, measurability, predictability,
controllability, patterning, the construction of laws and rules of behaviour”
and seeks causal explanations to produce claims (Cohen et al.,
2007, p. 26; Treagust et al., 2014). Within this context,
quantitative methods are more aligned with such a perspective, trying
to capture social reality through predesigned categories and measurements as
well as providing causal-effect explanations.
