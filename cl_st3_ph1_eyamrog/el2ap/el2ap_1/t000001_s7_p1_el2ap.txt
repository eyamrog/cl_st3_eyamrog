Compared to eukaryotes which have complex genomes often exceeding one
billion base pairs (bp) in length, prokaryote genomes are small,
typically containing a single circular chromosome a few million bp
in length and often small extrachromosomal plasmids1. In many genomic
applications, it would be most useful to know the bacterial
genome sequence in its entirety, i.e. the full sequence of
nucleotides for each piece of DNA in the cell. However,
DNA sequencers work by fragmenting the genome and sequencing the
fragments, producing reads: randomly ordered small pieces of the genome2.
Reads are imperfect, with the frequency and type of errors
depending on the platform. They are also redundant, because it
is necessary to produce reads that total to many times
the genome size to ensure that the genome is well
covered. There is thus a disconnect between what sequencers provide
(small, imperfect, redundant sequences) and what we want (a complete,
error-free genome).
