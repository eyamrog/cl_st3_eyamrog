To compare the JUOJS disciplinary breakdown to the profile found
in Scopus (with an overlap of less than 4% between
them; see below), one finds a mixed picture. On the
one hand, Scopus has a higher proportion of titles in
mathematics and medicine and health sciences, while the set of
JUOJS have a higher proportion in education and language, communication
and culture (Table 2). Yet in other disciplinary areas the
journal coverage of disciplines is roughly comparable between the JUOJS
and Scopus two sets, such as economics, engineering and computer
science. One can imagine more advanced citational studies to determine
the extent to which journals in these two sets draw
on the other in their shared disciplinary interests.
