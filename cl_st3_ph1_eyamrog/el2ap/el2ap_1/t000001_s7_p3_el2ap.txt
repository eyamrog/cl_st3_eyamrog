Many downstream analyses do not require high-quality assemblies, e.g. one
can identify the species of a genome or the presence/absence
of a gene using a crude assembly3. There are, however,
tasks which require extreme accuracy, e.g. estimating mutation rates and
inferring transmission chains, where even a small number of errors
can have consequences. Perfect assemblies offer no limits on their
downstream uses, making ‘is my assembly good enough?’ an irrelevant
question. In the absence of assembly errors, many analyses which
involve interrogating reads directly (using computationally intensive approaches, e.g. variant
calling) could be replaced by simpler assembly-based alternatives.
