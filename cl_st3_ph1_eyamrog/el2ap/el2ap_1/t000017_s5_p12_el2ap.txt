Although this study is an important contribution to the evaluation
of cognitive development in the preschool stage, due to the
presentation of nine subtests for the educator to apply in
her educational context and to use the cut-off points to
issue criteria on the child's progress, a limitation is its
sample size with respect to the national population, so that
in future research it should be extended to a significant
sample in different provinces of the country. Similarly, other statistical
measures such as the ROC curve could be applied and
the cut-off point obtained could be compared with a population
of children with special educational needs or with developmental limitations.
