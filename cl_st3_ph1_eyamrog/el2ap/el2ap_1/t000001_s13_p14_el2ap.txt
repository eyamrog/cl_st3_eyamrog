Our tool Polypolish30 was designed with two goals in mind.
The first was to use all-per-read alignments to overcome some
of the constraints imposed by repeats. The second was to
be very conservative, i.e. to minimise the chance of introducing
errors during polishing. Polypolish only makes changes that are unambiguously
supported by the read alignments, so when there are multiple
possibilities at a locus (e.g. a base could be A
or C with some alignments supporting each), Polypolish will not
change the sequence. For this reason, we recommend running Polypolish
before any other short-read polisher.
