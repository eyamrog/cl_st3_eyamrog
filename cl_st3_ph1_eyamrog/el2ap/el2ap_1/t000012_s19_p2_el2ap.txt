Some families were analyzed only with one species counting as
a cleaner species, such as Coraciidae, Cuculidae and Furnariidae. But
still, it seems that there is a tendency that the
cleaner species have a more diverse diet, when compared with
other species in their families. With Furnariidae, for example, the
H mean value was about 0.113 without the cleaners (which
in this family, represents about 99.5% of the members) but,
if only considering the cleaner species, the H value was
about 0.5 (which in this family, represents about 0.45% of
the members). All values can be found in Supplementary fig.
