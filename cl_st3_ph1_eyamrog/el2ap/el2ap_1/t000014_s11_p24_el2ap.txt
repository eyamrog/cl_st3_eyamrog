While archiving is key to the long-term conservation, preservation, accessibility
and discoverability of language documentation data, not all data are
equally appropriate for archiving, or for archiving in the same
way. Some materials may be culturally or personally sensitive to
the point that they simply should not be archived at
all. Other materials may require restricted access, as noted in
ยง2.3 above, such that only certain people may engage with
them. Sometimes such restrictions may pertain in different ways to,
for example, an audio file, a video file, or a
written transcription of the same event. Examples of potentially sensitive
material include esoteric or protected knowledge that is not meant
to be shared with particular people or groups of people
(e.g., community outsiders, members of other clans, men vs. women),
personally damaging speech, and information that could endanger individuals or
communities. Language documentation and archiving calls for open and ongoing
communication among documenters, speakers/signers, and other community members in order
to ensure a fully ethical and informed process, as we
elaborate in ยง4 below.
