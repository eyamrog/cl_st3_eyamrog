These findings indicate that there are times when teachers combine
strategies of hetero- regulation and self-regulation to deal with emotional
demands and make emotion regulation more effective, revealing the dynamics
and complexity of teacher emotional regulation (e.g., SUTTON, 2004; TAXER;
GROSS, 2018). It is added that both emotional and pedagogical
repertoire are necessary for the chains to be effective.
