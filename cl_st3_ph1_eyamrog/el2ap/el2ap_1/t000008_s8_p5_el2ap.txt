Previous studies pointed out that this palm species may display
dormancy, and water immersion treatments can enhance germination (Fava &
Alburqueque 2011, Masetto et al. 2012). Besides, seed storage behavior
knowledge is still insufficient (but see Masetto et al. 2012).
Several species, including palms species that dominate wetlands ecosystems may
show fruit/seed dispersal and germination strategies related to the water
pulse (Orozco-Segovia et al. 2003, Fabri 2018, Pires et al.
2018, Bao et al. 2018, Oliveira et al. 2019, Elias
& Viera 2020). Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the
pretreatment in water immersion (~ 25 and 75Â°C) and the
one year of storage on seed germination of C. alba,
and addressed the following questions: i) do these seeds show
dormancy?; ii) what is the effect of water pretreatments on
germination of the caranday pyrenes?; iii) what is the classification
of germination behavior after one year of storage?; and iv)
do the pretreatments in water immersion enhance or reduce the
germination of stored seeds? The thick endocarp can hinder germination;
thus, water immersion treatments are expected to improve germination. However,
we anticipated that seed viability might decrease after the relatively
prolonged storage period.
