According to Luria, the neuropsychologist should identify the main defect
through an in- depth interview about the subject's life (habits,
skills, knowledge, lifestyle), but at the same time, he suggests
applying some simple tasks to verify what the subject says.
For example, the examiner gives verbal commands for the subject
to execute "with your right hand, touch your left ear".
In this way, you observe whether the subject is able
to follow and comply with the verbal order during the
process and for this you should rely on neuropsychological factors,
such as verbal retention and programming - control of conscious
actions. However, other factors should continue to be analyzed, since
it should be observed if the correct hand was selected
and if it was correctly oriented in space (visuospatial organization
of the motor act; sequential motor organization; programming and control
of the motor act).
