Effect of storage and pretreatments on germination of the stored
pyrenes - After one year of storage, stored pyrenes were
used to assess the viability through a germination test and
categorized the seed storage behavior. Seed-bearing species are, in most
cases, recognized in three categories based on Roberts (1973) and
Ellis et al. (1990): orthodox or desiccation-tolerant (seed can be
maintained ex- situ over the long-term using conventional genebank protocols);
recalcitrant or desiccation intolerant (seeds tolerate short-term storage under well-defined
and well-controlled environments); and intermediate or partly desiccation-tolerant (seed can
be maintained in medium-term storage).
