As a further but still preliminary analysis of citation practices
surrounding JUOJS, the most-cited articles in English, Indonesian, and Portuguese
were examined for their citation by JUOJS or by other
publications. For the leading English-language article, which has 16,432 citations
and is published in the Journal of Statistical Software, 95%
of the articles citing it come from outside of JUOJS
(Table 4). Judging by this one very successful article, the
journal is contributing to the broader research literature. This is
less the case with the top-cited article in Indonesian, published
in Jurnal Ekonomi dan pendidikan, and the top-cited article in
Portuguese, published in Outra travessia. These two articles are cited
less frequently than the English leader, with 1,321 citations and
1,408 respectively, with those citations coming to a far greater
extent from JUOJS. The leading Indonesian article had 73.2% of
its citing articles in JUOJS, while for the leading Portuguese
article the proportion was 77.7%. This likely reflects the prevalent
role played by JUOJS in these two languages, although still
roughly one-fifth of the citing articles come from sources other
than JUOJS. Much more systematic work is needed on this
question of citational dynamics in recalibrating scholarly communication, and this
will be the subject of future studies.
