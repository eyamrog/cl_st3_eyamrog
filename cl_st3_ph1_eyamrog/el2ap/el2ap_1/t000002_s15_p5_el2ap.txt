In this section, we focus on the systematic coding method,
as it is the most popular among researchers and examines
interaction as a turn-taking system and categorises each of them.
Within this method, the analytic process of discursive data involves
the reduction of the data through the marking of relevant
points about what is looked for. Very frequently, this procedure
is called ‘coding’ and enables the researcher to “organise and
structure the data” at the same time that “translate raw
data into particular conceptual references” and then “identify links to
the different categories” (Evans, 2013, pp. 158–159). Objectivity is a
key aspect of systematic coding as it encompasses the development
of a scheme that needs to be unambiguous; that is,
the criteria for coding must be clear enough so that
different observers assign the same code/category to the discursive unit
(Galton et al., 1980). Quite frequently, codes come from a
theoretical framework or previous research. In this case, this research
may be labelled as ‘template’ since the analytical framework is
informed by the theoretical perspective, “so that the analyst knows
just what they are looking for in the data from
the start” (Robson, 2002; Taber, 2013, p. 293).
