In view of the analyzed data, it appears that access
to ICT in Brazil, despite having evolved quantitatively via cell
phone, has decreased qualitatively, because access to the computer devices
that enable more elaborate studies and professional activities has decreased
sharply, as well as access to it through schools and
other public spaces, as shown earlier. Access to academic and
professional knowledge about ICT has evolved very little for teachers,
as shown by the research of the aforementioned bibliographic review.
