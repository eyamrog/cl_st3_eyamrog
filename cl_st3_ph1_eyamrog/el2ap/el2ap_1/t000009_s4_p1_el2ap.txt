This paper aimed to discuss the benefits of using ICT
to conduct a contextual TSA at a distance. Results show
that this use was essential for two main reasons: besides
facilitating data analysis through multiple computer programs, such as Microsoft
Word, Microsoft Excel, and AntConc, they enabled the researcher to
gather data at a distance and to ensure the specificity,
praxis, and criticism that CEAP pedagogy advocates for.
