Music, as suggested above, is central to the practice of
capoeira: bodily movements are coordinated and regulated rhythmically through music.
Capoeira rodas are always accompanied by live music, but even
when the students were just practising isolated movements during Sandroâ€™s
classes, there was always recorded music playing in the background.
