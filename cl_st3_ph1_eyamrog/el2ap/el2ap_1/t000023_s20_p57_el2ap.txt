Note: According to Coesel & Meesters (2007), Cosmarium pseudopyramidatum is
morphologically close to Cosmarium pyramidatum Brébisson ex Ralfs, but differs
in having a single pyrenoid per semicell and being up
to 60 µm long. Just one individual specimen of this
species was collected during the present survey.
