Of this segment of 58,148 documents, 63% are coauthored, and
among these one can see some trends in within-country collaboration
that opens up an interpretation beyond the dualistic terms of
academic inbreeding/cross-breeding. In effect, 59% of the documents are by
authors from the same state; however 31.9% involve collaboration between
authors from institutions in two different states. There is even
9.1% involving authors from three or more states (the maximum
is 26 different states). This is an extremely complex and
heterogeneous country, with a large number of university and scientific
institutions, making it difficult to characterize a collaboration between two
Brazilian authors (or publication in a journal of their country)
as a practice of academic inbreeding. Collaboration between authors from
different institutions within the same state can be thought of
in the same vein.
