Since Independence in 2002, there has been a new transnational
movement. A significant number of young Timorese men and women
have been leaving Timor-Leste in search of work in Indonesia,
South Korea, Australia and in Western Europe. On Independence, Portugal
made it possible for all Timorese born before May 20,
2002 (the date of Independence) to apply for Portuguese citizenship
and, thus, for the right of residence and employment in
Portugal, and elsewhere within the European Union (EU). This was
because, under international law, the eastern region of the island
of Timor remained a colony of Portugal until Independence in
2002. Neither Portugal nor the United Nations recognised the Indonesian
occupation and administration of the territory from 1975 to 2002.
This political and legal arrangement helped to alleviate the high
level of unemployment among young people in the urban areas
of Timor-Leste in the years immediately following Independence.
