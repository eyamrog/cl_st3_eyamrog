The archives referenced here employ a set of graded access
codes, which indicate the different levels of access available for
different files. ELAR has the following codes: a) O for
free access, b) U for materials that can be accessed
by creating an account in the collection; and c) S
for materials that are restricted and can only be accessed
with the depositor's permission. Files marked with the access code
S may contain personal or sensitive information about the speakers,
such as conversations and life stories, or may be currently
under analysis by the depositor. Materials in the AILLA collection
have similar access levels, indicated by numbers instead of letters.
Some archives require users to complete a free registration on
the website before any materials may be accessed.
