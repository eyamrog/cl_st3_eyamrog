The BNCC reflects a belief that these technologies are the
determinants of and savers of Brazilian educational problems. But what
should be incorporated and integrated as increased knowledge historically produced
by humanity, comes rather with its own interests, intensely influenced
by market interests, in a way that is out of
context of the Brazilian socio- economic reality. Its recommendations are,
fundamentally, focused on providing teaching tools, which really should only
constitute part of the knowledge to be imparted to students
in ICT. It does not mention how and when investments
will be made in the technological infrastructure of schools, nor
in the training of teachers to work with digital technologies
at the expected intensity and, does not guarantee internet access
in homes.
