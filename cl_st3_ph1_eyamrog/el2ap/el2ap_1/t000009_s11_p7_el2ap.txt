A critical approach to EAP implies new roles for teachers
and students, who are not only seen as technician and
novice members of the discourse community, but, respectively, as transformative
practitioners (Morgan, 2009) and legitimate members of the community who
can also be agents of change (Benesch, 1996). In this
respect, CEAP turns out to be a good investment in
developing countries, where university students need to be prepared for
academic communication and for the pursuit of scientific equity.
