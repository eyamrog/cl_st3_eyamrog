Nonetheless, there are clearly important asymmetries in the different variants
of collaboration between authors from different states. For authors of
documents from a given state, the other top five states
with which there is co-authorship are analyzed, São Paulo appears
as a prominent "partner" in 26 cases, Minas Gerais in
25, Rio de Janeiro in 21, Rio Grande do Sul
in 14 and Paraná in 12. Then Pernambuco comes in
with 7 and Brasilia with 5. There are seven states
which do not rank among the top five collaborative states
for any other state.
