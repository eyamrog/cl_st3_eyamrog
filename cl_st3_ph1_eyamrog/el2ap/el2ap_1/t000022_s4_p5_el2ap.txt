Another intrinsic feature of scholarly communication in Latin America is
the widespread adoption of Open Access which is fostered by
the decision of research funding agencies, universities, scientific societies, and
publishers to provide not-for-profit infrastructures for visibility in the global
flow of scientific information. It is worth noting that the
entire OLIVA corpus is available in open access and full
text on the websites of the SciELO Network and Redalyc
platform, as well as on the websites of each journal,
and in thematic and institutional repositories. In addition to the
production analyzed in these 1,720 journals, there are thousands of
other journals in the region that show evidence of long-
term operation that have been key to expanding open access
in the region.
