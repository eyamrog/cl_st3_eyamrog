In a capoeira roda actions follow each other in an
established order. The opening song is called ladainha, sometimes translated
as litany. It is a song praising capoeira, the old
mestres and God. It is sung by the leader of
the roda; the other participants of the roda wait and
listen before joining the chorus, while the two capoeiristas are
waiting ao pé do berimbau, often touching or holding each
other’s hands. They are waiting for his blessing to start
the game, which he grants them by tilting the berimbau
slightly over their heads. To leave a roda, capoeiristas often
extend an arm towards each other, and the two players
often hug before leaving the roda, through the same place
from where they entered it.
