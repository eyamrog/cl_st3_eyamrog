A perfect bacterial genome assembly is one where the assembled
sequence is an exact match for the organism’s genome –
each replicon sequence is complete and contains no errors of
any scale. While this has been difficult to achieve in
the past, improvements in long-read sequencing, assemblers and polishers have
brought perfect assemblies within reach. Here we describe our recommended
approach for assembling a bacterial genome to perfection using a
combination of Oxford Nanopore Technologies long reads and Illumina short
reads: Trycycler long-read assembly, Medaka long-read polishing, Polypolish short-read polishing,
followed by other short-read polishing tools with manual curation. We
also discuss potential pitfalls one might encounter when assembling challenging
genomes, and we provide an online tutorial with sample data
(github.com/rrwick/perfect-bacterial- genome-tutorial).
