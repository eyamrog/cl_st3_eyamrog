The data could be further explored by searching for variations
in the codes’ frequencies across tasks (question 2) and using
statistical analysis to find significant variances. The dataset was consistent
for non-parametric tests to compare three or more populations (Fligner-Killeen’s
test was above the significance level for all but the
D_EVA code when comparing tasks or groups, p > 0.05).
This result allowed non-parametric tests to analyse comparisons among groups
employing the Kruskal-Wallis test and the post-hoc Nemenyi test. The
‘other’ and ‘inaudible’ codes were discarded and not considered for
analysis.
