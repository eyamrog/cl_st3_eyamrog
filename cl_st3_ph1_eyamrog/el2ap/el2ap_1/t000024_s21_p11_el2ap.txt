The results of this work corroborated that these facultative epiphytic
bromeliads can be simultaneously relocated to soil and tree trunks.
However, the survival of the species to relocation varied, showing
a different capacity to adapt to the physical and physiological
condition imposed by the removal from their natural environment. These
differences are probably due to the existence of various genetic
predispositions related to the mechanisms of tolerance to relocation. The
factors associated with the individual morphological characteristics, which have probably
determined the survival percentages, should also be considered since both
species were in good phytosanitary conditions during their maintenance in
the nursery. Lunelli et al. (2015) observed that epiphytes have
diverse responses when transplanted and recommend studying the species' biology
to monitoring relocation.
