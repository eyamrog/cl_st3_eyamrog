Indeed, frontal lobe development favors the development of motor and
fluid intelligence, both of which benefit from the maturation of
these brain structures (Khng & Ng, 2021). Therefore, the evidence
verifies that intelligence can be stimulated not only with reasoning-type
tasks, but also with game situations and activities where perception
and motor skills lead to reasoning and analysis. In the
same sense, this result is consistent with the study by
Fernández-Hernández et al. (2022), who revealed that the child's physical
conditions contribute to the development and performance of higher cognitive
functions. Despite little control of educational and cultural variables, the
present investigation shows that there is significant neuropsychological and intellectual
variability between groups of children even when they live in
the same country. This proves that three points should be
considered when applying cognitive and neuropsychological tests in the child
population: first, the standardization and validity of tests according to
the characteristics of the region. Second, to establish norms for
classifying and issuing a diagnosis. Third, to make an assessment
of the sociocultural characteristics of the child, including its context,
parental stimulation and the educational institutions involved.
