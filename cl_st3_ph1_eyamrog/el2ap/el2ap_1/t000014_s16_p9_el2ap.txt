To contribute to the development of indigenous language documentation in
Brazil, the linguists at the Goeldi disseminate, through intensive training,
knowledge of the technology and methodology involved, including suggestions for
equipment. This training is also carried out among indigenous groups.
Moreover, the archive offers digitization and storage services for legacy
recordings (see ยง5 below). For example, the Goeldi team is
currently working with an anthropologist to digitize his collection of
115 cassette tapes (both sides) of two Nambikwara dialects. The
recordings, some from the 1970s, include music, a dictionary, conversations,
and minimal tone pairs. The recordings are being digitized and,
in collaboration with the anthropologist, will soon be catalogued and
deposited in the digital linguistic archive. He will receive copies
in .mp3 format, which take up little space and can
be returned to Nambikwara communities. Cassette tapes can be deposited
in the archive or returned to the researcher. People interested
in this service should contact the Goeldi Linguistics Area (linguistica@museu-
goeldi.br).
