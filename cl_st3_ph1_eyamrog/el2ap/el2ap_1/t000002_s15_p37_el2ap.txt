Although this was a why-question, there was so much indication
of the correct answer that it was not coded as
a dialogic invitation. Then, in lines 87 and 88, the
teacher developed a largely complete explanation, leaving only a final
word unsaid for student completion—‘vapour’. Having this expected response, she
moved on with the explanation relating vapour, the scent, and
its spreading around the room. It was an explanatory construction,
despite the narrow, inducing line of reasoning that the teacher
pursued.
