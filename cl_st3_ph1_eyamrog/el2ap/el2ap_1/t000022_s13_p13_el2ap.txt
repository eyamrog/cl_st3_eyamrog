As can be seen in Figure 4, 66% of the
journals are edited by universities, close to 7% by governmental
agencies, while scientific societies and independent research centers account for
20% of the publishers. This shows a strong preference for
academic and public management. We also identified and classified the
commercial publishersâ€™ share: local or national commercial publishers (6%), and
major commercial publishers (2.5%). Journals in medicine and health predominate
within the local commercial publishers. Here is where the share
by ECIMED is noteworthy.
