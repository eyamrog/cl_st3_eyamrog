The multivariate normality distribution was analyzed, through the estimation of
the skewness and kurtosis indices, the fulfillment of the normality
assumption is confirmed when the scores of the indices are
within the threshold Â± 1.5 (Cuadras, 2016) (Table 4). The
KMO test indicated that the data can be subjected to
factor analysis (KMO = .81).
