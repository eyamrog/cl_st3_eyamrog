Conducting an exploratory and qualitative study proved necessary, given the
scarcity of studies of this nature in the field. This
methodology also filled some gaps in international studies. However, the
present study has limitations that must be considered, such as
the generalization of the results and its reliance on behavioral
memories. In addition, the high frequency of cognitive change and
situation modification strategies, considered adaptive, a priori, may indicate response
bias due to the "healthy worker" effect. Another limitation was
disregarding the impact of demographic variables, such as gender and
age, which can influence emotional regulation.
