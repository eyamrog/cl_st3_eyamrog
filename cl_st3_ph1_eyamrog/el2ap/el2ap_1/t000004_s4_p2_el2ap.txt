Moving from the first stage of language learning, characterised by
repetition of words and phrases and passive knowledge, to the
next one where a more active production of the language
is required can be a challenge, and our observations suggest
that this transition usually requires additional language learning outside of
the capoeira space. Sophie is an example of an accomplished
learner who acquired the language through a combination of learning
through songs (capoeira, Brazilian music), listening to conversations between native
speakers of Brazilian Portuguese and some more formal language learning
strategies (using a textbook), alongside factors such as passion for
capoeira and Portuguese language as well as prior knowledge of
other Latin languages (she is a native French speaker and
has studied Spanish). Marianne shows a knowledge of communicative Portuguese,
used appropriately (i.e. beyond the knowledge of songs or isolated
vocabulary. Capoeira classes then work as a starting point in
learning Portuguese, and capoeira provides a strong motivation for developing
this initial knowledge (as accomplished capoeiristas need to speak the
language on a more advanced level).
