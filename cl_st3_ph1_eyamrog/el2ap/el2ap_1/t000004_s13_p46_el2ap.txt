If you sing a song, you need to put a
fundament on the song, a meaning on that, sending a
message to people on the song. A lot of people
in these days they get challenged by a singer and
they don’t know what that means. I come to you
and I sing a song to you, you don’t really
bother of what I’m singing, and I come to the
roda and I kick your head. Oh, why did you
kick me? I told you I would. How? I sang
the song telling you I would, you didn’t listen to
me, you didn’t pay attention on the song. You got
beaten. Like one of the songs, just one of them,
it says “valha me Deus, Senhor São Bento, buraco velho
tem cobra dentro.” This is a kind of songs that,
“valha me Deus”, like, protect, kind of protect me God,
and protect me Saint Benedict, “São Bento” is a saint
who protects you against the snake bites, so snake bite
or it means someone is biting, [...] capoeirista just gonna
try to attack me. “Buraco velho tem cobra dentro”, the
old hole on the floor have a snake inside. When
you sing this kind of songs, maybe, there is a
really experienced guy in the roda playing with you, so
I’m warning you, be aware because you are playing with
a person with a lot of experience, so don’t try
him, because it may be dangerous. (Interview with Sandro -
