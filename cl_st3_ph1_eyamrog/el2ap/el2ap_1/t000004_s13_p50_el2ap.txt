Sandro started playing and singing, then we joined when the
moment of the chorus came, sometimes struggling with the singing
and the melody, which could be quite funny. Sandro was
shouting: Tá desafinado!/ it’s out of tune! Or: Tá ruim
demais mas assim é que se aprende!/ it’s horrendous but
that is the way to learn! (Fieldnotes)
