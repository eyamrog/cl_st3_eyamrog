The determination of total soluble carbohydrates levels (mg g-1) was
based on seed samples (200 mg) of each treatment, previously
described, using the phenol-sulfuric method (Dubois et al. 1956). The
samples, in triplicate, were macerated with liquid nitrogen and transferred
to test tubes (15 mL), with an addition of 0.4
mL of ethanol (80% at -22 °C) and kept in
a water bath at 70 °C for 5 minutes. The
extracts were centrifuged at 3.000 rpm for 10 minutes and
after its conclusion, the supernatants were collected. This process was
repeated 3 times, followed by filtration with glass wool and
had the volume adjusted to 2 mL with ethanol (80%
at -22 °C). Afterward, 50 μL of the extract was
added to 450 μL of distilled water, 0.5 mL of
phenol (5%), and 2.5 mL of sulfuric acid (96%). The
total carbohydrate content was estimated from a standard curve, determined
based on a standard carbohydrate Glucose and with absorbance measured
at 490 nm on a spectrophotometer (Pro- Analysis V-1600)
