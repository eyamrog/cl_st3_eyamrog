Most of the new citations were made by contemporary mycologists
since the last publication of Spegazzini, 122 years ago. The
next recording of gasteroid fungi in the country occurred in
2013 (Campi et al. 2013), and more recent studies have
been carried out by Campi and collaborators (Campi et al.
2015, Campi & Maubet 2015a, 2015b, Campi et al. 2017,
Maubet et al. 2018)
