In this research strand, Kleinâ€™s (2012) study is one of
the most relevant. The author precisely distinguishes between countries that
presented capital controls as a sporadic (or temporary) instrument from
those that permantly imposed capital controls. The first group included
Latin America and some developed countries, while the second consisted
mostly of Asian economies. Thus, some panel regressions analyse the
differences between countries in terms of economic performance, financial vulnerability,
and exchange rate due to their different approaches to capital
controls. The first estimation established that for 1995-2010, the countries
that imposed permanent capital controls showed higher rates of economic
growth and lower rates of financial variables growth.
