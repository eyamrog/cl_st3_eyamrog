(Seeds cryopreservation of Vriesea reitzii Leme & A.F. Costa endemic
bromeliad from Atlantic Rainforest). Vriesea reitzii is an endemic bromeliad
from the Atlantic Rainforest. The objective of this research was
to evaluate the cryopreservation using the method of direct immersion
of its seeds, collected from capsules at 120, 135, and
150 days after anthesis (DAA). The water content was determined
before cryopreservation, while the germination percentage, germination speed index (GSI),
and total soluble carbohydrates were quantified after cryopreservation. The highest
percentage of moisture (17.6%) was observed in 120 DAA, while
the highest percentage of germination (89.6%) and GSI (17.0) were
observed in 150 DAA. Optical and transmission electron microscopy analyses
were performed, and no cell damage or changes at the
morpho-histological and ultrastructural levels were observed after the cryopreservation process.
From these results, V. reitzii seeds can be classified as
orthodox seeds and the cryopreservation (+LN) is an efficient tool
for an ex situ conservation of this species.
