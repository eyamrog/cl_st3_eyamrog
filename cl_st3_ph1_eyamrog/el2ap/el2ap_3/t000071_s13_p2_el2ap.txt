This study took place in three phases from 2018 to
2021. The initial phase involved reaching out to a small
sample of publishers and journals using OJS that appear on
Beall’s list and in Cabells Predatory Reports to see if
they would be receptive to suggestions on improving their journals’
quality. The second phase sought to establish how many journals
using OJS are to be found on Beall’s list and
in Cabells Predatory Reports. The final phase represents a technical
response to the first two phases. It proposes ways for
the scholarly publishing industry to both verify and communicate to
the public a journal’s adherence to scholarly standards, as the
long-standing lack of transparency makes predatory practices possible while leading
to the uncertainty surrounding, and likely misuse of, the “predatory”
label.
