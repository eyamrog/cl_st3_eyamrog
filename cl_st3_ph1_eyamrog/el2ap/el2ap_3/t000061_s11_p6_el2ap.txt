Adorno's theoretical rejection of this archaic moment of mimesis is
due to the nullification of the subject's subjectivity for thoughtless
incorporation into the context and to the use of non-rational
mechanisms for mitigating fear. For Plato (1997), the use of
mimicry in education puts at risk the construction of the
laborious path of rational understanding of the world through the
seduction to the enjoyment of nature and the arts. Along
the same lines as Platonic criticism, but thinking from modernity
onwards, Adorno and Horkheimer (1985) perceive that the first (archaic)
mimesis can represent a threat to the process of clarifying
nature based on reason.
