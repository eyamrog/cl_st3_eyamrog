Seed conservation is the most efficient and economical way to
store germplasm (Kaviani 2011). This technique has been studied in
bromeliads with success in its application. Seeds of six species
of the genus Encholirium and two of Dyckia cryopreserved without
the use of cryoprotectants maintained the germination percentage after cryopreservation
(Tarr√© et al. 2007), even as for Encholirium spectabile Mart.
ex Schult. & Schult.f. seeds, which it was proven that
the use of cryoprotectants is not necessary for cryopreservation (Ferrari
et al. 2016), likewise, seeds of Dyckia brevifolia Baker and
Dyckia delicata Larocca & Sobral showed respectively 92% and 79%
germination after cryopreservation without cryoprotectants (de Paula et al. 2020).
