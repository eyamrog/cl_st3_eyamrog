Cheating interactions promote, in a certain frequency, trait disparity in
mutualistic networks by generating clusters of species traits. In intermediate
frequencies of cheating interactions, the joint effect of mutualistic selection
favoring trait matching and cheaters interactions favoring trait mismatching create
clusters of species traits. There is theoretical evidence that the
proportion of positive and negative effects between species is close
to 1:1 in real communities (Dodds 1997). Thus, it is
possible that our results showing higher trait disparity due to
the formation of trait clusters in intermediate levels of cheating
interactions could be empirically tested. The presence of cheaters may
be underestimated in empirical networks (Genini et al. 2010), partially
because there is great behavioral plasticity among interacting individuals (Bronstein
2001). Thus, intraspecific variation generating behavioral plasticity may play an
important role in individual fitness and lead to occasional cheating.
This indicates that trait disparity may be higher than expected
in mutualistic interactions and future studies would benefit from trait
disparity measurements in empirical communities.
