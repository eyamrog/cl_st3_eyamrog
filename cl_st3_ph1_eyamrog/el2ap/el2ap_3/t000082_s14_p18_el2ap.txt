Note that 𝜀𝑖𝑗 represents a trait barrier which dictates if
there is a selection on a victim by a cheater
species. In contrast, bij describes that a potential mutualism or
cheating interaction cannot occur because of a large trait dissimilarity
between partners. By incorporating bij in our model we explored
how network structure changes through time as an outcome of
the coevolutionary process. With this approach, in each simulation timestep,
we verified if there were interacting species with differences in
trait values higher than bij Following equation 11, we disconnected
those interactions generating an interaction loss. Since we are focusing
on how the network changes due to interaction loss, once
the interaction is lost, it remains lost and cannot reconnect
during the simulations. Thus, at the end of a simulation,
we may have an interaction network with a different structure
generated through the removal of links. We then compared the
initial and final network structure in each particular simulation.
