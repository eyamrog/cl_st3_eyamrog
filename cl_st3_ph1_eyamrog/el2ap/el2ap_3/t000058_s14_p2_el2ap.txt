The geographical coordinates of the 18 sample municipalities were extracted
from the platform Global Gazetteer Version 2.3 (http://www.fallingrain.com/world/.). These data
were the basis for the devising of a map covering
the phytogeographic areas [46], utilising QGis software (V. 3.22.3-Białowieża). The
culicids in the collection were captured by different methods, such
as entomological nets, aspiration, light traps (CDC) and Shannon traps
containing a fluorescent bulb as bait. [1,2,17].
