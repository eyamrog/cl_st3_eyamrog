However, following Adorno (1982, 2009), it is important to consider
that the use of mimetic behavior is necessary, but not
sufficient, and should be combined with the development of students'
conceptual reasoning skills, only accessible through adequate and guided theoretical
reflection. The mimetic stimulus is an excellent instance of sensitization,
but it needs to be accompanied by a rational effort
by the subject, under penalty of transmitting the idea as
naive as it is dangerous that the foundation of the
moral field is simplistic. This warning is especially necessary in
a context in which self-proclaimed norms of abound codes of
ethics, which hide control interests over scientific activity and norms
that intend to regulate research.
