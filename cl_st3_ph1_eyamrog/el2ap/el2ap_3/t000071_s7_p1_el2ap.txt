We come to this book on “predatory practices in scholarly
communication” as members of a project that develops journal publishing
platforms and conducts research on open science. In this chapter,
we work with a set of 521 journals using that
platform that also occupy a place on one or both
of the two significant lists of journals said to be
“predatory.” One of the lists, representing 30,968 journals from “potential,
possible, or probable predatory scholarly open-access publishers,” was maintained until
2017 by University of Colorado Denver librarian Jeffrey Beall (Beall’s
list, n.d.). The other, which has assembled 15,470 titles since
2017 in a “database of journals [which] our specialists have
flagged as probable threats,” is Cabells Predatory Reports (Cabells, n.d.).
The publishers and journals on these lists are presumed to
prey on researchers, luring them to pay an “article processing
charge” (APC) to publish in what is only the pretense
of an open access scholarly journal.1 We write “presumed to
prey” because of how difficult it is for Beall, Cabells,
or any other observer to know whether a journal is
adhering to such scholarly standards as peer review. The challenge
stems from how journals arose out of, and often continue
to be, the work of scholarly societies and groups consisting
of trusted colleagues (Csiszar, 2020). This has meant that editorial
transparency has not been an issue, apart from a journal’s
listing of well-respected names on the masthead. Now that the
internet and open access have broadened the global scale on
which an expanded array of research is produced and circulated,
those given to deception can hide behind this tradition of
trust. Without access to a journal’s editorial processes, Beall and
Cabells rely on proxies for “probable threats” to scholarly integrity,
such as unprofessional websites, incomplete mastheads, exaggerated claims, and email
spamming.
