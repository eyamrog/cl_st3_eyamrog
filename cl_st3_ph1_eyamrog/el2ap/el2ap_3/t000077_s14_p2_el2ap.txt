Due to the pandemic, IBGE carried out a special additional
survey, PNAD COVID- 19, which started on May 4, 2020.
PNAD COVID-19 data collection was carried out by telephone in
nearly 193 thousand households across the National Territory. The questionnaire
had two parts, one for health and the other for
labor issues.
