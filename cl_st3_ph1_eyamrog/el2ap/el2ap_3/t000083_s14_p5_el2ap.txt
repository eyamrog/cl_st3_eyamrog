For the pilot study, it is recommended to test the
translated and adapted questionnaire in a small portion of the
target population, among 30 and 40 people at least, to
assess possible difficulties in understanding the questionnaire. At this moment,
the operational equivalence was also evaluated, referring to the operational
aspects involved in the application of the questionnaire, such as
the format of the questions [if online or paper] and
the mode of applicability [if self-completion or by interview]. After
the cross- cultural adaptation of the SBS, it was inserted
into a virtual Google Forms platform and a link was
created to be disseminated for data collection from the pilot
sample consisting of 45 adolescents aged 12 to 18 years
who, in addition to answering the questionnaire, were asked to
indicate how easy/difficult it was to understand each item and
an open field for suggestions.
