Soil penetration resistance was measured for ten times following the
linear transects described above (figure 2). We arbitrarily selected four
impacts to determine soil penetration resistance. This include the first
impact which is the inherent weight of the equipment followed
by the other three impacts which resulted from the impact
of a standard 2 kg weight into the soil. To
minimize the effect of soil moisture on our penetration measurements,
we carried out the measurements in the dry season (August)
when soil moisture is minimal (Oliveira et al. 2005).
