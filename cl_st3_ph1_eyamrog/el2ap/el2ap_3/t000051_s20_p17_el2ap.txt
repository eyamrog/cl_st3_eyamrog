Finally, I identify a latent regime change in Russia discourse,
which is at the level of the proximal not-yet-spoken. It
can be identified in the judgements that in many Russian
cities, people have protested against “Putin’s war”, showing “großen Mut
und große Tapferkeit” (‘great courage and true bravery’), and that
“we” stand with all those in Russia who “Putins Machtapparat
mutig die Stirn bieten und seinen Krieg in der Ukraine
ablehnen’” (‘who are boldly defying Putin’s regime and opposing his
war against Ukraine’). Given the preference for dialogic contraction in
Scholz’s speech, there is a notable concentration of dialogically expansive
strategies applied to this discourse (“we should not forget” the
protests, “Ich bin ganz sicher: Freiheit, Toleranz und Menschenrechte werden
sich auch in Russland durchsetzen”, ‘I am quite sure that
freedom, tolerance and human rights will prevail in Russia, too’).
That language, while entertaining possibilities of protests, freedom and human
rights, does open the way for arguments that the Russian
people agree with Putin and that freedom, tolerance and human
rights do not currently prevail in Russia in general, which
is a strong and unfounded claim and one that the
West used in the past to justify wars against countries.
