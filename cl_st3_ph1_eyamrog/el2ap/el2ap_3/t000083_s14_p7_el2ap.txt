The SBS is an instrument developed by Indian researchers (Balakrishnan
and Griffiths, 2017) to assess behaviors related to taking selfies,
called selfitis. In the original study developed by Balakrishnan and
Griffiths (2017) conducted with 225 Indian university students (average age
20 years), an exploratory factor analysis was applied and six
factors were identified: environmental enhancement, social competition, attention seeking, mood
modification, self-confidence, subjective conformity. The SBS comprises 20 items that
are rated using a five-point Likert scale (1 = strongly
disagree and 5 = strongly agree), where higher scores indicate
higher levels of selfie-taking behavior. Scores ranging from 20-40 indicates
low selfitis behavior, 41 to 60 indicates mild selfitis behavior,
61 to 80 indicates moderate selfitis behavior and 81 to
100 indicates severe level on selfitis behavior.
