Following the two previous play activities, this testimonial seems to
have brought light to real problems participants were facing. It
somehow encouraged them to share experiences and react to all
those stories and feelings that were being exposed. The careful
listening, reactions of shock, support, and relief seen on the
faces on the screen, during each of the testimonials, clearly
showed how affected by them participants were.
