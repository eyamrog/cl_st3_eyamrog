Combining the three selection components described above (equations 1, 2,
and 3), the evolutionary change of Zi in timestep t+1
is given by: <> , in which, φi is a
compound parameter formed by additive genetic variance and the slope
of the adaptive landscape. The parameter ϒi dictates the importance
of ecological interactions versus environmental factors as selective pressures. Thus,
trait evolution, in our model, is defined as: <>
