Such connection was also enabled by play, which creates a
collaborative space for participants to overcome immediate obstacles in terms
of communication and, more importantly, refer to broader contexts and
think of viable possibilities for their existence. Through play, the
overcoming of obstacles can be sustained in a collective experience
that involves increasing everybodyâ€™s potential towards social justice. Play becomes
an ongoing reflexive and practical exercise to deal with otherness,
its conflicts, and our inherent impulse to move on, which
are constant and vital in human development.
