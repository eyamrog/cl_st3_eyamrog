For example, when editors, editorial board members, reviewers, and authors
initially register with a journal’s publishing platform, they will be
required to log into ORCiD (Fig. 2). To be listed
as the editor of a journal would involve a further
log in with ORCiD in which this new position would
be added to one’s ORCiD profile, while ORCiD will provide
the journal with a hyperlinked ORCiD icon, enabling readers and
authors to explore the editor’s background and qualifications knowing that
the identities have been authenticated and that appeals can be
made to ORCiD if anything seems amiss. Such systems may
be susceptible to circumvention, as no technology is foolproof, of
course, but the effort required to do so without detection
will have been greatly increased and in ways that can
be further improved in the face of violations.
