We highlight the use of the formulation prefaced by the
discourse markers and and so in “And so... when you’re
saying you’re not sure”. Martinez prefaces his formulation with a
conclusion: “and so you’re saying”, but he also preserves the
sense of what Arias said, according to what he understood,
basically repeating that she is not sure. Then he confronts
her answer by asking her “you were a little bit
more sure under direct examination weren’t you?”. This formulation deletes
the part of her utterance that she is not sure,
transforming it into other information which provides another way to
interpret that: if she was a little bit more sure
before, why is she not sure now? So, he keeps
on asking her to get precise information that could be
useful for his arguments, as we can see through the
segment “But you were more... sure about the time... do
you remember back to you?”.
