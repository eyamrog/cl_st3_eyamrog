Through TEM, the seed ultrastructure's, observed in cells of the
embryo of non-cryopreserved seeds (-LN), were identified with the presence
of membranes, organelles, and nucleus in the natural state (figure
2a). Besides, in detail, cells with a large number of
reserve structures in lipid bodies (figure 2b) and protein bodies
(figure 2c). Additionally, analyses of embryonic cells, from cryopreserved seeds
(+LN), presented cell integrity, in other words, the absence of
damage, lysis or, injury to membranes, and cell walls (figure
2d). As depicted, in detail, the membranes of the nucleus
and cell wall (figure 2e), in addition to the structures
of protein and lipid reserves (figure 2f). TEM results added
to light microscopy results confirm that the seeds preserved the
structural integrity after cryopreservation.
