Therefore, the conservation of forest fragments is extremely important for
the maintenance of species, and later, their propagation. Even if
there is no anthropic activity aimed at removing these propagules
to other areas, the fauna alone already contributes to the
dispersion. In a study by Neto et al. (2020), after
analyzing the seed bank of abandoned eucalyptus areas, close to
preserved fragments, concluded that they can become areas favorable to
the natural regeneration of native species, due to this proximity.
In view of this, through a low financial cost assessment
of the soil seed bank, cataloging the floristic composition and
the density of species, it is possible to define strategies
for ecological succession in areas that need restoration (Martins 2001,
Brancalion et al. 2015).
