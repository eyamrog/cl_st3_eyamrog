A typical example of what is needed to develop the
bioeconomy can be found in Brazil. In addition to having
15 % of the planet's species, Brazil has abundant land,
a suitable climate, a low population per unit area and
a large amount of natural resources; however, it is also
an example of how the export of raw materials diverted
the country from the creation of infrastructure, policies, and institutions
capable of working from a bioeconomic perspective.
