Both indexes were described by their median, interquartile range, total
range and 95th percentile. The relationship between the indexes and
journal size was described using scatter plots drawn with ggplot2,
version 3.3.5 (Wickham 2016). The relationship of journal subjects and
countries with these variables was described by overlaying the same
scatter plots with one smoothing spline for each subject or
country with 20 or more journals.
