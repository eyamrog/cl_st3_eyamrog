In addition, in this new theoretical literature some models also
support the international coordination of capital controls, which represents a
significant shift in the orthodox presumptions that advocated full capital
account liberalization, such as the ones derived from the efficient
markets hypothesis. In other words, the multilateral aspects of capital
controls are gaining theoretical formalization, since new studies suggest international
coordination among capital recipient countries and between capital recipient and
capital source countries. One of the main arguments present in
these studies is that the unilateral imposition of capital controls
by emerging recipient economies has an increasing and convex cost,
so there is a reduction of the welfare in private
agentsâ€™ utility function in economies that resort to these regulatory
measures very intensely. Policies aimed at the international coordination of
capital controls should then be elaborated to share the burden
of the capital controls imposition among capital recipient countries and
between capital recipient and capital source countries and, therefore, reduce
the convex cost associated to unilateral controls on capital inflows
(Ostry et al., 2012; Korinek, 2012).
