For Plato (1997), the impulse to behave mimetically is irresistible
to human being This tempting character resides in the pleasurable
feeling provided by the mimetic experience, as an aesthetic experience
of fruition and belonging to nature and the environment. By
observing the surroundings to form images and behaviors to be
imitated, the human being learns through the representation and internalization
of these models. According to Plato (1997), this tendency towards
imitation is so intense that it would justify the deprivation
of contact with artistic production in the education of young
people, as art is understood as an imperfect representation of
reality (conceptual reason would be the privileged path access to
true knowledge) and which, in addition, contains negative examples that
could be followed by young people (especially referring to Greek
tragedy and comedy) (Gagnebin, 1993; Wulf, 2008). Furthermore, Plato (1991)
criticizes the passive character of mimesis, as a mere representation
of what already exists, being stripped, in his understanding, of
a creative character on the part of the subject who
mimics. For these reasons, it is possible to state that
Plato rejects the use of mimetic behavior as a resource
for educating young people.
