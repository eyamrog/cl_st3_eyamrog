In 2015, there was a compilation of texts written in
controlled and uncontrolled time settings. First, students submitted texts as
part of in-class mock tests, to capture students' skills in
writing under time constraints and with a proposed topic. Three
were mock tests for B1 and B2 level students. All
of them presented the same instructions regarding text production. Students
had to write a 300-word essay (minimum) based on a
set topic in 30 minutes. Since digital text collection worked
well, the compilation process became standardized, and, from 2016 on,
students have submitted texts with distinct registers through online forms,
according to their proficiency level, as described in Table 1.
Systematic corpus compilation has allowed the research group to keep
a sound learner corpus, which will be described in the
following section. Before sending their texts, learners are asked to
fill in a digital form through Google Forms with their
information and to read a consent form for their participation
in the research, with which they may choose to agree
or disagree. This form comprises students’ information in a way
that helps researchers keep better records of participants’ social and
linguistic backgrounds, and specificities of the task. Such a consent
letter is provided in the Appendix.
