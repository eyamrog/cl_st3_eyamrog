From the first semester of 2016 on, the number of
collected samples was quite higher than in the previous year,
a situation that remains. The reason that 2015 had the
smallest number of samples is due to the compilation process,
which were through mock tests, as previously mentioned. Not all
students produced the task, many did not give consent to
have their texts included in the corpus and some texts
did not achieve the minimum words. Therefore, fewer texts remained
to be part of the corpus.
