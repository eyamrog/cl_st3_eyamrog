In this phase, we set out to determine the extent
to which journals using OJS are identified as “predatory” in
Beall’s and Cabells’ lists. In the first instance, we compared
the PKP list of journals using OJS with Beall’s final
list of predatory publishers and journals, which he suspended in
2017 after several publishers and organizations fought back against such
listings (Silver, 2017). To establish how many journals Beall’s list
ultimately represented in 2018, we counted the journals in a
sample of 231 publishers (19.9 percent of the 1,163 publishers)
without regard to the use of OJS (Table 2). The
average we found of 24.3 journals per publisher suggested that
Beall’s list represents 30,968 journals as “predatory,” including the 1,395
standalone journals. We also found that 61.7 percent of these
journals had not yet published an article, while 6.3 percent
did not have a website, a proportion that rose to
32 percent by 2021.9 Of journals using OJS, 366 titles
are associated with Beall’s list, amounting to 1.2 percent of
the journal total for Beall’s List and 1.4 percent of
the 25,671 active journals known to be using OJS (Table
