Moreover, the maximum carbon absorption rate of the plants at
the garden was about 45% higher than the plants in
the greenhouse but about 70% smaller than the wild plants.
Spite the statistically significant differences among the experimental groups, some
measurements of the maximum carbon absorption rate of the plants
at the garden were close to the plants in the
greenhouse. It is difficult to find in the field young
plants of Vellozia squamata that could serve as for a
comparison. It is not clear if the photosynthetic performance of
the younger plants is something inherent to their youthfulness or
if it is sort of a side effect of the
protocol of micropropagation. Indeed, Durkovic et al. (2016) described that
the way of obtaining seedlings can interfere in the leaf
development, generating leaves with different photosynthetic parameters.
