Our median infiltration capacity estimate was higher compared to the
rain intensity of various storms in the region (figure 4).
Thus, we rule out the occurrence of infiltration excess overland-flow
in this forest. However, our penetration resistance indicated a likely
reduction of these permeability with depth which was, to some
extent, expected due the presence of the plinthic horizon. A
previous study on plinthic soils showed the formation of a
perched water table above such layer (Moraes et al. 2006).
Furthermore, riparian forests, like the one studied here, generally might
occur in shallow water table zones (Ribeiro & Walter 2008).
In case the water table (perched or not) intersects the
soil surface, both return-flow and overland-flow are triggered (Dunne &
Black 1970a, b, Elsenbeer & Vertessy 2000). Thus, saturation overland-flow
can occur. In this case, unlike the generally expected role
of surface runoff sinks, these zones might act as surface
runoff sources instead. More studies are needed to clarify percolation
capacities of these soil and their implications for runoff processes.
