Corinnidae are, in general, larger than the Linyphiidae and have
a glossy black color, which leaves them visibly more exposed
to predators. It is possible that these spiders avoid FA
to seek refuge in environments with greater leaf density that
provide greater protection against predators, as pointed out by Dinniz
(2011). Another influencing factor is the preference of this family
for moist environments (Patucci 2018) and H. coronarium can accumulate
a small amount of water in some parts of the
plant.
