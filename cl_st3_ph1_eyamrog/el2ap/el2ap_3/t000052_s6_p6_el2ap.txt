Bagrobdella vanhovei shows a high variability in its morphometrical characters
(Fig. 12), with small, medium and large measurements for similar
hard parts. These differences, apart from a great variability of
specimens from a single species, may be due to two
likely reasons: 1) presence of different species, 2) the use
of different medium to prepare the slides (see Fankoua et
al. 2017). Knowing that we did not see morphological differences
between “large” and “small” specimens, and that both were found
together on same slides (in the same medium), we are
most probably in the presence of a species with a
great variability in the size of its haptoral hard parts.
