“We’ve been teaching online, but many of my students are
struggling because they lost their jobs, so they don’t have
money, they’re being evicted from apartments, so they don’t have
some place to live, they’re going hungry, so I’m teaching,
but I’m also helping my students find food, find somewhere
to live, to find how to apply for unemployment benefits,
so that they have a little bit of money. So,
it’s been really hard here… and specifically because… there’s a
big difference between the white people and everybody who’s not
white and so my students of color, my black students,
my brown students are also suffering more than my white
students, which is very upsetting. So, just being very busy
trying to help my students. I think of them as
my family, so it’s hard to rest when my family
is suffering like that.”
