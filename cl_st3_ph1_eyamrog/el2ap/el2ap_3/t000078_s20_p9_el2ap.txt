Tests on residues (Moranâ€™s I tests) point to non-spatial randomness
(Table 4, columns 1-4). When using the SLXb estimator to
correct spatial dependence (Table 5, columns 9-11), the estimated coefficients
are theoretically counterintuitive (overall effect) and statistically significant. These models
estimated without control for sub-centralities indicate that the price of
land is higher in the fringes of the city -
a result that is not observed. Moreover, the null hypothesis
of spatial randomness is not rejected. The exception is the
log-level functional form model with control for the quadratic form
of the distancing from CBD, which global effect results agree
with the theoretical models (Table 5, column 12). However, these
counterintuitive results open space to evaluate the second hypothesis: do
the non-intuitive and statistically non-significant results of the CBD coefficients
stem from the omission of SBD controls?
