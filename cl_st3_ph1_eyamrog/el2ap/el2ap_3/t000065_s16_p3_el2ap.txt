In 2014 another attempt to collect student texts and compile
a learner corpus was made. As the primary goal of
having students write texts was pedagogical, many decisions were taken
by the subject teachers and, thus, most essays were handwritten.
The time and effort demanded to transform the written texts
into a digital format led the research group not to
include 2014 texts into CorIFA. The group considered that, despite
transcriber training, there were risks of misspelling or grammar errors
being modified by the person digitizing the documents or by
computer spell checkers, leading to texts that would not reflect
studentsâ€™ real English level. Since the experience of receiving paper-based
texts did not facilitate the process of corpus compilation, from
2015 on, the texts have been collected only in digital
format, where students fill in an online form.
