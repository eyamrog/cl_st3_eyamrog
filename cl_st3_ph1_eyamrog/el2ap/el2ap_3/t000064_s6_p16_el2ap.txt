As a conclusion, for improving the protocols, it is useful
to compare the responses of the wild and the in
vitro plants. The data herein presented may help to adjust
the PAR intensity to obtain more mature seedlings with perhaps
a higher survival rate at the transition between in vitro
and greenhouse conditions. Therefore, the development of technology for producing
seedlings of Cerrado species is a complex task, but of
great importance for their conservation and domestication.
