Bearing in mind the relevance of culicids to diverse areas
of natural and applied sciences and the importance of biological
collections as a source of conservation of biodiversity data, it
is thus essential that all information about this insect should
be published, shared and made available to the entire general
and scientific community. Thus, the data collection on culicids and
cataloguing of the Ana Leuch Lozovei Entomological Collection at ColPar/DPAT/BL/UFPR,
has led to a repository of information on the culicid
fauna of some phytogeographic regions in the state of Paran√°.
The collection presents important potential for the utilisation of data
and such information as knowledge of the entomofauna of places
that were not degraded at one time or to reveal
species that are currently difficult to collect in the state,
so contributing to future studies of the fauna and environmental
conservation. The subfamily Culicinae represents the major part of the
present species and the genus Culex presented the highest number
of specimens in the collection, corresponding to around 40% of
the total, distributed among 52 species, making it the most
diverse. By contrast, the genera Aedeomyia, Lutzia, Onirion and Shannoniana
are the least represented, with just one species each. As
for Anophelinae, there are two recorded genera, namely Anopheles, represented
by 30 species, and Chagasia, with just one. The period
of 30 years spent on study furnishes a timeframe for
one to understand the dynamics of population fluctuation or the
detection of species not previously recorded, enabling the generation of
data on areas of epidemiological potential for diseases related to
culicids [22].
