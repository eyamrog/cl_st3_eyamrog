In the micrographs of V. reitzii seeds, seeds with the
embryo and plumose appendages at the time of conservation are
noteworthy (figure 1a). In the embryo region, a reaction of
the acid compounds to the TBO was observed, characterized by
the procambium, formed by the nuclei of the embryonic cells,
which presented a dark purple colour (figure 1b, see arrow).
