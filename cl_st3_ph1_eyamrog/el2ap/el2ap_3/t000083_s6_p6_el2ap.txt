It was observed that people who had mild selfitis level,
scored higher on "mood and confidence" factor, which brings items
that present the change in mood and self- confidence, from
the selfie behavior. It is known that mood change, especially
that which is for the better, along with a sense
of self-confidence can reinforce the behavior, increasing the chances of
addiction, as it activates the brain reward circuitry. In the
present study, feeling good about taking selfies and viewing them
privately before posting, increased the individual's self-confidence. In this regard,
Tajuddin et al. (2013) highlights the positive relationship between self-confidence
and positive mood (self- efficacy feeling). Meier & Gray (2013)
assessed a sample of American adolescents, in relation to general
Facebook use and found that higher amounts of Facebook photo
postings, were related to feelings of self-confidence, while activities such
as viewing friends' photos and visiting others' profiles, including commenting
on friends' photos and unfollowing their photos, was related to
a range of lower self-confidence indicators. Self- admiration can also
lead to increased self-confidence, improved mood, and increased desire to
take and post selfies (Boursier & Manna, 2018). However, it
may be that the increase in self-confidence is mainly experienced
online, during the posting of the selfie, which would also
be something important to investigate. In the same vein, social
media interaction via mobile digital devices seems to help many
individuals overcome negative mood states (McLean et al., 2019). This
is corroborated by Khan & Imran (2019), who claim that
selfie behavior is related to mood regulation.
