We characterize the structure of the networks calculating two common
measures of network structure: nestedness and modularity (Almeida-Neto et al.
2008, Blondel et al. 2008). For each simulation, we computed
the number of interactions loss generated by the coevolutionary dynamics
at the end of the simulation, F. We computed the
indexes describing structural change between the final and initial network.
We used two indexes of network structure change: ΔNODF (Almeida-Neto
et al. 2008) and ΔQ (Blondel et al. 2008). For
each network, these measures are calculated as the difference between
the network nestedness (NODF) and modularity (Q) at the end
and at the beginning of the simulations: <>
