Based on the theoretical arguments and data presented, it is
possible to affirm that mimetic behavior is at the center
of the experience provided by USR and, to that extent
it can be an important resource to be mobilized for
the moral formation of subjects. In line with Benjamin's (1985)
argument, this resource is capable of mobilizing the aesthetic dimension,
as necessary as it is mistreated in the context of
formal education, and acquires even more relevance in a context
of proliferation of control norms, often alien to interests and
needs of the CHS field.
