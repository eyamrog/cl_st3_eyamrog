As for the families with the largest number of individuals
sampled, Urticaceae stands out with 220 individuals (44.53%), distributed in
three species, Cecropia glaziovii Snethl. (127 individuals), Cecropia pachystachia Tr√©cul.
(91 individuals) and Urera baccifera (L.) Gaudich. ex Wedd. (two
individuals), followed by Cannabaceae, which presented 97 individuals (19.64%), belonging
to Celtis sp. (50 individuals) and Trema micrantha (L.) Blume.
(47 individuals). Solanaceae is the third in number of individuals,
with 66 individuals (13.36%), belonging to Solanum americanum Mill. (47
individuals), Solanum lycocarpum A. St-Hil. (nine individuals), Solanum mauritianum Scop.
(seven individuals), Capsicum baccatum var. praetermissum (Heiser & P. G.
Smith) Hunz. (two individuals) and Nicandra physalodes (L.) Gaertn. (one
individual). From these data, it is possible to observe that
most of the individuals obtained correspond to pioneer species, suggesting
that in a possible transposition of soil for ecological restoration
these individuals could contribute to the beginning of the recovery
of the area, promoting soil cover and favoring the subsequent
development propagules of non-pioneer species.
