There is no widely used method for collecting spiders, so
it is difficult to compare results. However, the collected data
in the present research coincide with data from different locations.
Linyphiidae and Theridiidae appear among the most abundant families in
several studies (Lopes et al. 2008, Silva et al. 2014,
Breitenbach et al. 2015). In the present study, Linyphiidae was
collected more frequently in FA treatment.
