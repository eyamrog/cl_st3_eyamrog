On forensic linguistics, Caldas-Coulthard (2014, p.1) points out that it
is a newly created academic subject which is very active
in English-speaking countries, and The International Association of forensic linguists
(IAFL), which was founded in 1993 in Britain, demonstrates the
importance of this area. Bearing that in mind, this study
specifically falls within the scope of interaction in legal contexts2
as in this field of study and analysis, “forensic experts
focus on the spoken language of legal interactions (in courthouses,
police stations, interviews, among other contexts” (Caldas-Coulthard, 2014, p. 3).
