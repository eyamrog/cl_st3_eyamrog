As for construct validity, the exploratory factor analysis observed that
the 20 items of the scale loaded on 5 factors,
unlike the original study by Balakrishnan and Griffiths (2017) in
which 6 factors were found. It is believed that possibly
this difference is due to the number of factors between
the original study and the present study refers to the
sample difference, which in the original study was conducted with
college students and in the present study was conducted with
adolescents. Several authors have reported that adolescents are more active
in their selfie posting than young adults or older, highlighting
the need to evaluate the effects of selfie practices in
this population (Dhir et al., 2016; Baiocco et al., 2016).
In addition, one must consider the cultural aspects related to
both countries (Brazil and India) that may have influenced the
reduction of factors in the Brazilian version. In a study
on the psychometric properties of the SBS conducted in countries
such as Iran and Afghanistan (Lin et al., 2019), the
SBS remained with 6 factors and good rates in the
confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model. The Italian version of the
SBS, on the other hand, like the Brazilian version, also
presented a model with 5 factors (Monacis et al., 2020).
The "mood modification" and "self-confidence" factors, when grouped together and
were called in this study as "mood and confidence" and
showed satisfactory communalities (above 0.62).
