First, in terms of the domestic impacts, in the period
up to the crisis in 2008, the impulse-response functions show
that a net restriction on inflows increased monetary policy autonomy
and reduced the pressure on exchange rate appreciation (although with
mixed and less significant results), and the net loosening on
outflows reduced the monetary policy autonomy of emerging countries. However,
in the post-crisis period (2008-2011), the regressions show that the
domestic effects of net restrictions on inflows raised only monetary
policy autonomy to a smaller degree, and the net loosening
on outflows did not present any significant effect on the
‘trilemma’ variables. This relative loss in the effectiveness of the
controls was primarily due to the context of global high
liquidity (Pasricha et al., 2018).
