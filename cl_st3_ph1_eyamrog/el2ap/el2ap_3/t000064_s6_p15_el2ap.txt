The carbon assimilation rates verified in Vellozia squamata are relatively
low, compared to other Cerrado species (Palhares et al. 2010),
and according to Nogueira et al. (2004) are more typical
of secondary than pioneer plants. That is, in spite of
the large production of seeds with high germinability, the establishment
of Vellozia squamata is related to a complex ecological interaction,
highlighting the importance of the conservation of this species in
the environment, since even the seedlings herein obtained are of
a very slow growth.
