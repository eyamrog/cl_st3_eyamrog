Therefore, identifying sub-centralities improves the knowledge relating microeconomic development issues,
such as firm cost structure (congestion, labor force access, land
prices, etc.) to workersâ€™ welfare and productivity (spatial segregation, commuting,
wages, labor supply). Furthermore, SBD can be used as public
policy stimulating the creation of new business subcenters, reducing congestions
(approximating firms to workers), balancing land prices spatially (less pressure
on prices in the CBD region), and reshaping public transport
and taxation patterns.
