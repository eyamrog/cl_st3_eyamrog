Based on the percentages presented, it is possible to affirm
the importance of USR as a tool for the formation
of researchers' morality. However, this instrument is currently little and
poorly used in Brazil, which is evidenced by the percentage
of 50% of the respondents who, in some way, made
reference to the little appreciation of the research activity carried
out by the students. Among the evidences of devaluation, the
reference to the scholarship value, of R$ 400.0011 per 20
hours of research per week was the main issue mentioned
by the respondents. It is worth noting that the value
of the scholarship has not changed since 2012 and that
the USR programs are being subject to a significant reduction
in the number of scholarships, in the current context of
retraction in funding for education and science in Brazil.
