After formally obtaining the authors who developed the SBS (Balakrishnan
& Griffiths, 2017), we used the cross-cultural adaptation method proposed
by Brislin (1970; 1973; 1980; 1986) in which four stages
were part of the process: translation (and adaptation), semantic equivalence
assessment, pilot study, and back-translation. We also used the universalist
approach to cross-cultural adaptation of instruments, proposed by Herdman et
al., 1997; Herdman et al., 1998) considered one of the
most adequate for proposing a process that includes conceptual and
item equivalence (which includes a broad literature review on the
concepts that support the original scale and its applicability in
the Brazilian context), semantic (capacity of the scale to maintain
the original concept) and operational (which refers to the operational
aspects involved in the application of the questionnaire, such as
question format [if online or paper], mode of applicability [if
self- completion or by interview]).
