The results of the present study showed that the SCS
is a useful scale in the assessment of selfie-taking behavior,
which represents a new area within studies on the use
of digital technologies. Since this is the first Brazilian study
on selfie-taking behavior, it brings an addition to the literature
on disorders related to the use of digital technologies and/or
media. In addition to the psychological consequences of selfie-taking behavior
(which can be positive or negative), this study provides insights
for further studies to evaluate the concept further and in
different contexts and with different populations. Further research is needed
on the role in the acquisition, development, and maintenance of
selfiitis behavior, including personality traits, motivations, cognition, and attitudes.
