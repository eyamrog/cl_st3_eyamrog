As the specification that considers the quadratic form of distancing
is not very explanatory and generally does not present statistical
significance for the coefficients that capture such effect, the models
estimated by SLX will not be demonstrated in this specification.
The results derived from the SLX estimator show the signs
of the overall effects following the theory and are statically
significant. Moran's I tests do not reject the null hypothesis
of spatial randomness (Table 6, columns 17-22).
