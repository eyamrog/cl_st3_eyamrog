We collected 292 spiders belonging to 17 families. Only 35
individuals (12% of the total) are adults and represent 20
species belonging to 11 families. The six families represented only
by young individuals were: Oxyopidae, Pholcidae, Sparassidae (four individuals each),
Anyphaenidae (two), Philodromidae and Scytodidae (one individual each). Of the
families that were sampled with adult individuals we have: Linyphiidae
(nine adults), Corinnidae (eight), Theridiidae (seven), Salticidae (three), Idiopidae (two),
Ctenidae, Nemesiidae, Pycnothelidae, Theridiosomatidae, Xenoctenidae and Zodariidae (all with only
one adult).
