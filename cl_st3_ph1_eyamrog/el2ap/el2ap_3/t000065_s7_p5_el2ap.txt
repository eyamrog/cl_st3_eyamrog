To the best of our knowledge, there was no comprehensive
learner corpus of Brazilian university learners’ English written texts compiled
in the classroom context and available for the studies our
research group was aiming at. Therefore, in 2013, as Section
3 lays out comprehensively, a Brazilian learner academic English corpus
was designed (CorIFA9). Our efforts were motivated, fundamentally, by our
desire to improve learners’ use of academic English. Corpus analysis
allows the studying of a particular group and the corpus
compilation seemed to be a great challenge to be pursued
as, ultimately, it would be the basis for developing appropriate
materials and new courses. Accordingly, the aim of this paper
is to present the compilation of a learner corpus, much
needed in our research and teaching context, pointing out the
advantages of building this type of corpus for the understanding
of learners’ needs as well as for pedagogical decision-making based
on sound data. The following sections will deal, firstly, with
the literature, which is the basis of our work, secondly,
with the methodological paths taken to compile the academic English
learner corpus and thirdly, with studies based on CorIFA.
