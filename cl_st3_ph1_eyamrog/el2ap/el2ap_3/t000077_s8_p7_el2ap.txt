The impact of the pandemic varies significantly among countries as
there are many institutional differences between labor markets (Adams-Prassl et
al., 2020; Brussevich et al., 2020). According to Brussevich et
al. (2020), the heterogeneity in the possibility of remote work
across countries stems from the different access to and use
of technology, the sectoral distribution of the economy and the
selection in the labor market, with a strong association between
the level of economic development and the ability to work
remotely. In this perspective, the current study aims to address
the issue of inequalities in remote work specifically for Brazil.
