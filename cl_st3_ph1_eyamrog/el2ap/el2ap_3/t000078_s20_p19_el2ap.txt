Considering the activities sectors provided by IBGE, we focus on
activities concentration in each SBD. In general, SBDs are concentrated
on service activities. Table 7 shows the highest concentrations of
employment are in the construction (Campo Belo), credit institutions, insurance
and capitalization (Itaim Bibi), management and administration, real estate, securities,
technical service (Vila Mariana, Santa Cecilia, Pinheiros), and medical, dental,
and veterinary services (Jardim Paulista). Bel√©m is the only one
to have the highest concentration of employees in the manufacturing
activities.
