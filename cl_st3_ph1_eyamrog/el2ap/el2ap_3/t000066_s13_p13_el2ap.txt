This approach to the workshop considers the multimodal resources available
on ZOOM, which enable interactions among participants such as audio,
video, and written text in the chat. Revisiting Vygotsky (2004),
intentionality is always present to the facilitator in a collaborative
learning space because the facilitator is responsible for arranging available
resources to encourage participation. In this session, for example, play
and talk were the main forms of participation planned by
facilitators, who were the professors that organized the workshop.
