Epibatidine as a medicine did not prosper, because the threshold
between its therapeutic efficiency and its contraindications is narrow; however,
it served as a model for Abbot Laboratories to synthesize
and patent the derivative ABT-594 in 1995, with an analgesic
potency 200 times greater than morphine and without the dangerous
effects of epibatidine (Angerer 2015).
