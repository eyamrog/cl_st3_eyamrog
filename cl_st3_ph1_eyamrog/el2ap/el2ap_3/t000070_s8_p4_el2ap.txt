However, an effective alternative is to establish a cryopreservation protocol,
since it allows an effective and safe conservation of materials,
suiting the long-term storage system. In these protocols, different materials
can be used, for the most diverse plant species, such
as seeds, zygotic embryos, apical buds, meristems, and others (Engelmann
2011). Direct cryopreservation is presented as a simple methodology, which
consists of direct immersion of fresh or dehydrated plant material
in liquid nitrogen (LN). when such material is removal in
most cases whit reheating it in water at 40 Â°C
and the subsequent regeneration of the material happens (Popova et
al. 2016).
