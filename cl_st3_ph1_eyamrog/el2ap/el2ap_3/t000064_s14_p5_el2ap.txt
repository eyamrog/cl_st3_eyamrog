After each change in the light intensity, the IRGA was
programmed to record the value after it had stabilized. In
half of the measurements, the curve was carried out in
ascendant way and in the other half, in descendant way
of light intensity. For the plants of open conditions (garden
and control group - ecological park), the measurements were taken
between 09:00 and 10:00 AM during the rainy season; and
besides the curve A/light, the gas exchange rates were also
measured under the natural light intensity, of about 2,200 Âµmol
m-2 s-1.
