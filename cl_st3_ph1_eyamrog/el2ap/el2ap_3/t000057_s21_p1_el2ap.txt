The number of samples used for infiltration was considered appropriate
given the relative stabilization of the median statistics (figure 3).
The median infiltration capacity was 893 mm hr- 1(figure 4).
Mean (± standard deviation) of soil penetration resistance for all
four impacts were, respectively, as follows: 0.63 ± 0.21 MPa,
0.66 ± 0.32 MPa, 0.74 ± 0.22 MPa and 0.76
± 0.22 MPa (figure 5). There was a significant increase
in soil penetration resistance with depth. Such increase has previously
been documented for a forest within the Brazilian savanna (see
Pereira et al. 2021). Our resistance to penetration was lower
compared to a nearby savana (regionally known as “Cerrado típico”)
in the same area (Murta et al. 2021). Such difference
of soil penetration resistance in the riparian forest compared to
a savanna might be attributed to the higher and more
continuous addition of litter year-round in the forest compared to
the savanna (Costa et al. 2020). For example, Aquino et
al. (2016) measured an average of 6 ton ha-1 year-1
in a riparian forest whereas Valenti et al. (2008) found
0.6 ton ha-1 year-1 in a savana.
