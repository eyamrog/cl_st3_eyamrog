In this context, the most interesting aspect concerns the significant
reduction in the public-sector effect when controlling the types of
work. The descriptive analysis showed that the participation of remote
work among public sector workers is significantly higher than that
in all other employment statuses; in turn, evidences in Table
3 – comparing columns 3 and 4 – show that
this results from a composition effect, or from the types
of task prevalent in the public sector. Still on employment
status, the self-employed workers’ case stands out, with a lower
probability of remote work compared to salaried employees without formal
contract even if controlled for observable characteristics.
