The collaborative perspective (Magalh√£es & Fidalgo, 2019) of the workshop
highlighted its virtual nature, i.e., an online meeting. As in
meetings of this kind, participants need to deal with certain
constraints to play, such as managing time, negotiating rules to
reach the goal of the activity, listening carefully to others,
sharing, and asking for information, they have to come up
with strategies beyond the English language5 to interact. This happened
first in the breakout room and then in the general
room. This first activity worked as an icebreaker and was
important because it set the scene to what was coming
next in that play and talk session, that is, the
sharing of information about oneself. Also, it helped participants realize
meaning- making through the efforts the whole group put into
the activity.
