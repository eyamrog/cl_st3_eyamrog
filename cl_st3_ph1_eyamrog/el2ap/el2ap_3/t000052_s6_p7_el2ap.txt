During the study of these two new species, two small
hard parts that were never been reported before in the
description of Bagrobdella species, were seen. These are: 1) a
structure in the shape of a button between the bar
and ventral anchors (Fig. 14), 2) a semi-circular structure toping
the extremity of the ventral bar median projection (Fig. 15).
In order to properly define their fine morphology and function,
we need to observe fresh material or to use scanning
electron microscopy. For this reason, we did not mention these
structures in the description of the two new species.
