After this careful and detailed translation, adaptation, search for semantic
equivalence, and application in a pilot sample, the version of
the SBS for the Portuguese spoken in Brazil was back-translated
into English by a professional fluent in Brazilian Portuguese, but
whose mother tongue was English. The back-translation of the SBS
was done blindly, that is, the professional who did the
back-translation did not have access to the original questionnaire, nor
did he have technical knowledge on the subject, as recommended
in the literature (Beaton et al., 2000; Beaton et al.,
2002; Beaton et al., 2007; Guillemin et al., 1993; Eremenco
et al., 2005). The next step was to compare the
original version with the back-translated version and assess whether the
translated version maintained semantic and conceptual equivalence, i.e., whether the
items retained the same conceptual meaning after translation. The review
of the back-translation confers quality to the cross-cultural adaptation, especially
the conceptual equivalence (Herdman et al., 1998). This comparison between
the versions in search of possible discrepancies was performed by
the committee of experts, who in the present study were
the principal investigators. It was observed that there were no
discrepancies between the original version and the translated and adapted
version. After the comparison and evaluation between the versions, we
sent the back-translated version to the original authors of the
questionnaire to verify the equivalence of the items, which were
considered excellent by the original authors, who reiterated the authorization
to use the scale in Brazil.
