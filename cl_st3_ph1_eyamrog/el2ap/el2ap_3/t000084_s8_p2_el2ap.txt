The term emoji combines Japanese terms and many feel the
resemblance to the English words emotion and emoticon is purely
coincidental, however, like many words in various languages, there may
be connections. The first emoticon, the humble smiley :-) was
used in 1982 in a communication by Dr. Scott Fahlman,
a Carnegie Mellon Professor. As we see today the emoticon
or emoji has become part of our daily communication. The
updated miniature images were designed for use on mobile devices
to express emotions in text communication. Their popularity grew quickly
and spread around the world as a form of communication
and visual cues in the digital culture. Since face-based emojis
were created, the library of emojis has grown with the
introduction of animals, food, and other pictures (Alshenqeeti, 2016).
