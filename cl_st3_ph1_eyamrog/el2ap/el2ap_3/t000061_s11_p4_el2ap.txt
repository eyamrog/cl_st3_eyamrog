Returning to Plato, Adorno starts from a first moment of
criticism and refusal (especially present in Dialectics of Enlightenment, written
with Horkheimer), and then rehabilitates the concept of mimesis throughout
his work, namely in Negative Dialectics and, further, in Aesthetic
Theory (Bassani and Vaz, 2011). It is important to note
that, as a result of the change in the analysis
of the concept, some commentators claim that Adorno was not
able to substantiate mimesis as a theoretically consistent category (in
this sense, see Freitas, 2001). In defense of Adorno, it
is stated that there was a transformation of the concept
throughout his work and that such change, as a whole,
allows for a more complete analysis of mimesis, which is
of interest to this article.
