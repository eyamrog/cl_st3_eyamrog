The IRGA was adjusted as to keep an air flow
of 500 µL.s-1 and carbon dioxide of reference of 400
ppm. The relative air humidity of the reference air was
about the same in the treatments, as follows: control group:
45%; plantlets in vitro: 38%; seedlings in the greenhouse: 36%;
garden condition: 44%. The air temperature at the time of
the measurements were in a favorable physiologic condition, as follows:
control group: 25.5 ± 0.5 °C; in vitro plantlets: 26.0
± 0.1 °C; seedlings in the greenhouse: 30.4 ± 0.7
°C; garden condition: 31.3 ± 1.2 °C. The light intensities
were previously selected, varying from zero to 1,600 µmol m-2
s-1.
