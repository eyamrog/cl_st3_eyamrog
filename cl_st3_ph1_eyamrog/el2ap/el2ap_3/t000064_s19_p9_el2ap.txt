The paralellodromous leaf veins from the control plants, garden and
in greenhouse had a conspicuous vascular bundle sheath (figures 6
a, e-f). In addition, the bundle sheaths had extensions on
the adaxial side with large colourless palisade cells termed as
aquiferous (figures 6 a, e-f). This parenchyma connected the bundle
sheath to subepidermal fibre fascicles on the adaxial epidermis (figures
6 a, e-f). On the abaxial epidermal face, the sheath
was in direct contact with the epidermis (figures 6 a,
e-f). Leaves from in vitro plants have bundle sheaths with
no extensions (figure 6 d).
