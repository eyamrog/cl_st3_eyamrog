The results for gender are similar to those of Yasenov
(2020), Gallacher and Hossain (2020) and Brussevich et al. (2020),
and the results for race agree with Yasenov's (2020). Regarding
age, expressive difference was found only for those aged 16
to 19 years. The result that participation in remote work
is lower for young workers is quite consensual in the
literature (Brussevich et al., 2020; Gallacher; Hossain, 2020; Yasenov, 2020).
