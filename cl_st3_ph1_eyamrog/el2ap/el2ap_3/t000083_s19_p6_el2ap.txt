Pearson's correlation matrix was used to evaluate the degree of
association between the factors. In general, values above 0.50 were
observed among all factors. In some cases, a high correlation
was verified, for example, "social competition" factor presented high correlations
with the "attention seeking" (r=0.79), "mood and confidence" (r=0.80) and
"subjective conformity"(r=0.81) factors. There was also a strong correlation between
the "attention seeking" and "subjective conformity" factor (0.80), the same
for the "mood and confidence" and "subjective conformity" factor (r=0.82)
(table 2).
