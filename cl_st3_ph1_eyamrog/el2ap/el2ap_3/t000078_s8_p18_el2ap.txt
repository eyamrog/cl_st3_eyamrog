SBD is characterized by the highest price of land, from
which a decrease in these prices is proportional to the
distance, and by employment agglomeration, i.e., poles of attraction of
firms and workers. The method used in Plaut and Plaut
(1998) and Herman and Haddad (2005) may not be the
most recommended to identify these centralities. The authors considered the
error term of a hedonic price econometric model, and then
the kriging approach was applied. However, the latter approach may
be sensitive to relevant omitted variables, such as unobservable real
estate characteristics or amenities determining the price gradient.
