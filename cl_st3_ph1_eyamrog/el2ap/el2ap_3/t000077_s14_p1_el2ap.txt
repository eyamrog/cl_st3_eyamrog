The IBGE has systematically investigated general characteristics of the population,
education, labor, income, and housing by applying National Household Sample
Surveys (PNADs) in Brazil since 1967. As of 2016, PNAD
became Continuous PNAD, a quarterly survey to monitor labor force
fluctuations and general socioeconomic indicators.
