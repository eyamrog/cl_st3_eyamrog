In the third section, Scholz identifies a major challenge in
preventing Putin’s war from spilling over into other countries in
Europe. There is a discourse of NATO alliance, at the
level of the proximal already-spoken, manifest through a reference to
conversations with allied countries in Eastern Europe and through dialogically
contractive pronouncements and judgements to stand “Ohne Wenn und Aber”
(‘unconditionally’) by the collective defence obligation within NATO and “unsere
Entschlossenheit” (‘our resolve’) to defend every square metre of NATO
territory: “Wir meinen das sehr ernst” (‘We are absolutely serious
about this’). This is connected to the Germany as military
power discourse, which is latently present in the list of
recent actions the German army has carried out, appreciatively called
“wichtige” (‘important’) signals. Soldiers are thanked for their “important” services,
accompanied by a contractive pronouncement “sicher auch in Ihrem Namen”
(‘surely also in your name’), aligning the audience with his
position.
