This tacit knowledge, especially associated by the author with laboratory
practice, tends to be undervalued in the context of SSH.
This is mainly due to the more material character that
characterizes research practices in the biological sciences. In this sense,
learning by imitation is more evident in biological sciences than,
in general, in SSH, characterized by research practices that refer
to a merely rational learning, supposedly without materialization in the
physical world. However, mimetic learning is also an important resource
in the training of researchers in SSH, which is evident,
for example, when a young student learns to conduct interviews
by imitating the approach and interview techniques of a senior
researcher.
