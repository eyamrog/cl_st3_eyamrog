The term ‘Capital Flows Management Measures (CFMs)’ encompasses both types
of regulations; that is, capital controls and macroprudential policies. It
explains why some studies approach the effectiveness of CFMs imposed
by developed countries vis-à-vis emerging countries, which is discussed in
Subsection 4.3. In other words, the CFMs developed countries impose
necessarily relate to macroprudential policies, since any advanced country imposes
capital controls (that discriminate based on investors’ residency) since the
liberalizing reforms that took place in the 1970s and 1980s.
However, the CFMs emerging economies impose refer to both capital
controls and macroprudential policies. Having clarified these caveats, it is
now necessary to present the main studies that offer new
recommendation on the subject.
