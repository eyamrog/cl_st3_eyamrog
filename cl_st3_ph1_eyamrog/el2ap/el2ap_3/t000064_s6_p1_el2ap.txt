The species of Vellozia grown in open fields show a
strong photodissipating apparatus, which is important to protect the leaves
from the stressful conditions of Cerrado - the dry season
together with a high solar irradiance. Tocotrienols, which are strong
antioxidant compounds of vitamin E complex basically found in seeds,
have been identified in leaves of V. gigantea (Morales et
al. 2014, 2015). Thus, at the same time those plants
dissipate excess of light, they need high light intensities for
total development of the photosynthetic apparatus and leaf structure.
