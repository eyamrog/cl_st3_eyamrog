In Excerpt 7, the first version of Ms. Willmott’s question
is “And this is when?”, referring to Alexander sending a
photograph of his genitalia to Arias. In the second version
“When is it that he sent -- approximately when is
it that he sent you a picture of his genitalia?”,
we can see that one part of the meaning established
before is still preserved, but now transformed by resuming her
previous question. In other words, in the second version, she
preserved the exact word used in the first version (when),
added some new information, and transformed it into a more
objective question. The real intention is to know when Mr.
Alexander sent a photograph of his genitalia to Arias, but
due to Mr. Martinez’s objection, Ms. Willmott restates her question
in a more accurate way. An interesting point is the
use of approximately in the middle of the sentence. To
avoid further objections, she prefers to introduce a general term
that could protect Arias’s face in case her answer was
vague or not precise.
