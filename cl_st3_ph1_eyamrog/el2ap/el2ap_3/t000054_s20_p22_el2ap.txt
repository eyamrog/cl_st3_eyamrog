Through INEFAN, Ecuador filed a lawsuit against the patent in
1998, without results; the reasons given were that no evidence
was found that in Ecuadorian folklore the skin of the
frog was used for medicinal purposes, but rather as a
poison for hunting, and that the synthesis of ABT-594 was
not made directly from the skins of frogs, but taking
their structure as a model (Jurado 2021). However, under the
bioethical principle of utilitarianism or beneficence (maximum possible benefit for
a greater number of people), it is valid to ask
why the indigenous communities where the amphibian lives did not
receive benefits (Proto 2019).
