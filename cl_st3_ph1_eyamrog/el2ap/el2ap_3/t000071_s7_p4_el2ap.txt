Our intervention is two-fold: (a) We provide OJS-using publications identified
as predatory with ways of addressing the seeming reasons for
the label with the goal of improving their scholarly publishing
quality; and (b) we are about to add verification technologies
and communication strategies to publishing platforms by which readers will
be in a better position to assess journal integrity. The
overall goal here is to reduce the confusion and harm
that this phenomenon is causing in scholarly communication, while raising
the quality of scholarly publishing. Although providing such help, in
the first instance, may equip bad actors with a better
means of bluffing more authors and readers, we place this
risk against writing off a substantial body of legitimate research
and against new efforts to raise the technical bar for
practicing deception in scholarly communication. Still, readers are advised to
read this chapter with these conflicts of interest and sense
of responsibility in mind.
