Besides identifying the subcenters, it was possible to characterize the
activities in which each SBD is specialized, as well as
the wage and educational decomposition among SBD workers. Notably, SBD
with a higher concentration of employees receiving low wages presents
a higher concentration of workers with lower schooling levels and
concentrated in retail trade activities. SBDs concentrated in financial activities
have higher remuneration for workers and a higher concentration of
workers with a higher educational level than the former. Thus,
it was possible to notice that the identified sites are
centralities in the MSP and are heterogeneous.
