Sampling - To sample the seed bank were marked five
plots (10 × 10 meters (m)), located 5 m from
the Mogi Guaçu River (R) and a minimum distance of
30 m between them and five plots also 10 ×
10 m, located approximately 30 m from the Mogi-Guaçu River
(I). Splots I and R were numbered from one to
five, wherein the R1 and I1 plots were marked at
a distance of 250 m after the Water Treatment Station
in order to minimize its influence on the delimited plots.
For the measurement of the distance from the entrance to
the fragment to the beginning of the plots, as well
as the geographical position of each splot (figure 3), a
Global Positioning System (GPS) of the GARMIN Mark 20x model
was used.
