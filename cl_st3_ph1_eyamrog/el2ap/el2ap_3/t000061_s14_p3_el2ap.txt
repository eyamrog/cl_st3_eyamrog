The intention of this phase of the research was to
count on the answers of the USR scholarship holders of
the Graduate Programs in Education (PPG/Edu) evaluated with grades 6
and 7 by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher
Education Personnel (Capes). In October 2019, were contacted by e-mail
the respective USR directorates of the universities of the three
PPGs that meet the aforementioned criteria, headquartered in the South
Region. Of the three USR directorates contacted, two of them
responded affirmatively about sending link of the questionnaire to its
students in USR activity, and the third did not even
respond to the contact.
