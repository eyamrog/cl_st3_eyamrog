The theoretical literature on polycentric cities should be subdivided into
two main strands. The first one deals with the issue
of CBD and SBD as an endogenous problem to the
optimization process, considering economies of agglomeration and transport cost (Ogawa
and Fujita 1980, Fujita and Ogawa 1982, Anas and Kim
1990, Helsley and Sullivan, 1991, Henderson and Slade, 1993, Sasaki
and Mun, 1996, Berliant and Konishi, 2000). The main interest
is to assess how the city’s new spatial pattern impacts
the labor and housing market. The factors that lead to
a pulverized pattern of workers stem from high transport costs,
absence of agglomeration economies, direct sell to families, firms’ demand
for land, and higher price-elasticity of labor demand. The second
group of models is interested in assessing the effect of
employment suburbanization on residences’ prices and other aspects (Romanos, 1979;
Yinger, 1992; Wrede, 2015). These models focus on how workers
decide where to live and work and, consequently, how the
spatial pattern affects land price, population density, and work-home commuting.
The results presented are the decay of land price and
wages due to the distancing from the CBD and SBD.
Thus, the SBD also constitutes an anchor of real estate
prices and wages.
