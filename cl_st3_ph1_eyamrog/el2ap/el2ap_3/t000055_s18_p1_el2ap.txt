The sand flies held in FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB are adults and were
collected using a variety of diverse methods, including resting collection
from artificial and natural surfaces using either mechanical or manual
aspirators (“pooters”), human-landing capture, unbaited and CO2-baited CDC-like light traps,
and Shannon traps, operated in different environments, ranging from the
domestic and peridomestic (e.g., houses and their surroundings in urban,
suburban and rural areas) to the relatively undisturbed sylvatic and
wild (e.g., remote forest areas). Our specimens are from 20
different countries in the Americas and all 27 states of
Brazil are represented.
