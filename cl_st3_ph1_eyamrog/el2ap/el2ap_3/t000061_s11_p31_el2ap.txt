[...] from the perspective of pedagogical authority it was held
that the only honest and demonstrable license to teach is
that which one possesses by virtue of example. [...] The
valid teaching is ostensive. Show. This “ostentation”, which so intrigued
Wittgenstein, is present in the etymology: the Latin dicere, “to
show” and, only later, “to show by saying”; token and
techen Intermediate English with their implicit "what shows" connotations. (After
all, is the teacher a showman?) In German, deuten, which
means "to point", is inseparable from bedeuten, "to signify". (Steiner,
1998: 13, own translation).
