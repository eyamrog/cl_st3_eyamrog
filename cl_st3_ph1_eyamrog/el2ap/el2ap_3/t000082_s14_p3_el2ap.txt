In the cheating component Sai, selection favors trait matching for
the cheater species j (as in equation 1) but favors
trait mismatch for the victim species i, defined as the
species explored by the cheater. Like the mutualism component, in
our model, the magnitude of the trait change is dictated
by the evolutionary effect of species j on species i,
vij(t). Selection for trait mismatching between cheater on victim is
dictated by 𝜀𝑖𝑗: <>
