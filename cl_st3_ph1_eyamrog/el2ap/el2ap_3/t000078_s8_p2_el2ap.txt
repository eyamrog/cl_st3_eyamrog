SBDs generate competition for land among households and firms (Wheaton,
2004). The low-income family is impacted by this land-use dispute,
causing a spatial location change from the new business region
towards the city’s perimeter due to the upward pressure on
rent prices. Then, public transportation demand from the peripheral part
of the city to the center increases, disfiguring the concentric
pattern of transportation, which features a monocentric town. The commuting
patterns become unclear because cross-commuting is one of the household’s
choices. The worker decision is not constrained to minimize commuting
cost, but workers supply their labor force where their skills
are required. Therefore, workers have no assurance about commuting distance
minimization.
