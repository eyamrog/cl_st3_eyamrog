The vast majority of studies analyzed the circumstances in developed
countries. Among studies that focus on developing countries, Gottlieb et
al. (2021) measured the ability to work-from-home (WFH) in Armenia,
Bolivia, China, Colombia, Georgia, Ghana, Kenya, Laos, Macedonia and Vietnam.
They show that the ability to WFH is relatively low
and strongly correlated with per capita income in these countries
and that there is high heterogeneity across and within occupations
and across characteristics of workers, with vulnerable groups less likely
to work remotely.
