That price is high. It could be described as the
transformation of the mimesis original, pleasurable and threatening at the
same time, into a perverse mimesis that reproduces, in the
subject's insensitivity and stiffness, the harshness of the process he
had to go through to adapt to the real world
and, we would say with Freud, from being a child
to becoming an adult. This second mimesis is built on
the repression of the first; it characterizes the subject who
managed to resist the temptation of regression but who lost,
in this struggle as necessary as fatal, the plasticity and
exuberance of original life, when he did not lose life
tout court. (Gagnebin, 1993: 73).
