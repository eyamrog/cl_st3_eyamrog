Theoretically, SBDs concentrate "forces" capable of segregating due to the
increase of the land price, yet are capable, to some
extent, of decongesting urban roads when it can reduce the
commuting time within the municipality. The SBD cannot be seen
simply as the consequence of the firmâ€™s decision in the
space, searching by agglomeration gain, in a way autonomous and
independent. Contrarywise this, it should be considered an important public
urban policy mechanism capable of facilitating the matching between workers
and firms in the labor market. For instance, by reducing
the land taxes, the policymaker can incentivize firms to move
outside the center, increasing the city's land value and rebalancing
the municipality's land price.
