Another element from informal conversation is the marker I mean.
In the case above, this device is employed by the
speaker to guide the listener to a desired interpretation. This
metalanguage form of modalization approaches the discourse practice and the
representation of speech. The speaker draws attention to the way
things are being said, directing or redirecting the listener to
a particular intended meaning. Through I mean, speakers try to
lead the listener's attention to something that is more convenient
for them. Regarding the markers well and you know, we
point out the same functions mentioned in Excerpt 4, as
well as the hedge technically.
