We performed the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkim (KMO) test= 0.803 and Bartlett's test
of sphericity=0.89921; p=0.001 which concluded respectively the adequacy of the
sample and readiness to factor the data (Hair et al.,
2009; Kaiser & Rice, 1974, Tabachinich and Fidell, 2001). Table
1 presents the results of Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) on
SBS conducted with the sample of 261 adolescents. Unlike the
original version, the EFA found 5 factors and not 6,
having been loaded in the same factor the items of
"mood modification" and "self-confidence" factors which we entitled "mood and
confidence". We observed eigenvalues ranging from 1.05 to 5.10 in
each of the factors, being considered satisfactory (Hair et al.,
2009). The five factors explained 78.3% of the total variance.
According to the original study (Balakrishnan and Griffiths, 2017), at
least three items converged on each factor, and this explains
the homogeneity of the measure evaluated (Byrne, 2001).
