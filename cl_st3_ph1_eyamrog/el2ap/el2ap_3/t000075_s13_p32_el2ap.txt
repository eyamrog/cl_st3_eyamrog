One of the first theorists that grounded the use of
capital controls in this context was Korinek (2011). The theoretical
construction formalizes the prudential use of capital controls. According to
the model, emerging economies show an excess of external indebtedness
due to capital inflows because private agents do not internalize
the consequences of a future debt constraint due to excessive
indebtedness. According to the model, over the boom phase, debt
inflows raise internal consumption, promote asset inflation (which is also
used as collateral in financing operations), and provoke currency appreciation.
However, a negative shock on one of these variables promotes
financial amplification, which is characterized by currency depreciation, asset deflation,
and a contraction in aggregate demand. In this scenario, private
agents experience a vicious circle that leads to a relative
interruption of external financing and/or to an increase in its
costs.
