In philosophy, the relationship between education and mimesis has been
an object of reflection, at least since Ancient Greece, a
period in which it was understood as a form of
representation of nature, fundamentally linked to artistic expression, playing a
leading role in the thoughts of Plato and Aristotle (Schlesener,
2009). To account for the purpose of this article, the
theoretical framework will rely, above all, on the interpretations of
Theodor Adorno5 and Walter Benjamin on the concept of mimesis.
This choice is due to the fact that Adorno's work
retrieves arguments from the two Greek philosophers mentioned and makes
them more complex by combining them with analyzes from French
ethnology and Freudian psychoanalysis, which perceived the presence of a
regressive character in mimetic behavior. The dialogue with Walter Benjamin
was fundamental for a transformation in the Adornian concept of
mimesis (Gagnebin, 1993), which is why both authors were chosen
to serve as the basis for the analysis proposed here,
as they present complementary perspectives of approach to mimetic behavior
that serve to think about the experience of USR.
