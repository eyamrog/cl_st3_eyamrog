Altogether, 494 individuals from 19 botanical families were sampled, distributed
in 30 genera and 40 morphospecies (table 1). Among the
individuals identified at least at the family level, the greatest
diversity of species corresponds to Asteraceae (17.5%), followed by Moraceae
(12.5%), Solanaceae (12.5%) and Urticaceae (7.5% ). Some individuals had
no confirmed identification at the level of genus or species,
since they were not in reproductive state and the characteristics
in vegetative stage observed were not conclusive for safe identification.
