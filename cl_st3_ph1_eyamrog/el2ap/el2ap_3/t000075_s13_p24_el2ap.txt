This strand of the literature on different approaches on capital
controls also includes Fernández et al.’s (2016) study. The authors
use a database that lists several financial assets subject to
controls7 and analyze the effectiveness of capital controls by means
of co-movements between these regulatory measures and by an agregate
control indicator. The study of co-movements consisted of calculating the
correlation of the controls imposed on different financial assets and
between the controls on inflows and outflows over time. For
the ‘gate’ countries (that sporadicly imposed capital controls), the results
indicate a moderate correlation between the controls imposed on the
most liquid class of financial assets to both controls on
inflows and outflows. However, the controls imposed by ‘wall’ countries
(that permantly imposed capital controls) presented a high correlation, specially
between the controls imposed on the most liquid assets and
financial credit, to both the controls on inflows and outflows.
