There were clear differences in the photosynthetic parameters among the
treatments. In the in vitro plants, some leaves were capable
to absorb some carbon dioxide, mostly under light intensities between
100 and 200 µmol m-2 s-1, but overall, the measurements
showed only the respiration values, as the maximal values of
A were of -0.35± 1.25 µmol CO2 m-2 s-1. As
seen in figure 3, the leaves of the in vitro
plantlets showed a random pattern of respiration up to light
intensity of 100 µmol m-2 s-1, above which they showed
a reduction of the respiration rates up to the light
intensity of 900 µmol m- 2 s-1. To light intensities
higher than that, there was a slight deterioration in the
respiration rate, suggesting photodamage. In this way, to the in
vitro plants, there was no light compensation point.
