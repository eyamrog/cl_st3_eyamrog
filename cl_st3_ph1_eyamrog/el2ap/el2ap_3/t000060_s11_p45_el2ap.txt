Goffman (1974, p. 9) postulates that “face is an image
of self, delineated in terms of approved social attributes, therefore,
it is an image that others may share, for example,
when a person makes a good showing for his/her profession
or religion by making a good showing for himself/herself”. In
the process of interaction, speakers usually tend to construct a
positive image of themselves and their place in society by
adopting two possible attitudes: a defensive attitude, in which they
need to preserve their own face, and a protective attitude,
in which they must preserve their interlocutor’s face (Burgo &
Neto, 2016, p. 885).
