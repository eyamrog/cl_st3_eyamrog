Within this context, this paper presented an initiative carried out
by the GPB community, which was an online play and
talk workshop offered as one of the monthly events of
the group. It discussed and exemplified the theoretical and practical
concepts of collaboration and play that are two of the
fundamental concepts to this international group. The workshop entitled Global
collaboration: what can young professionals do?, seems to align these
two concepts in its organization plan and in the workshop
itself, highlighting the intent to transform realities brought about by
the covid-19 pandemic, which, in turn, seemed to inflame other
major social problems.
