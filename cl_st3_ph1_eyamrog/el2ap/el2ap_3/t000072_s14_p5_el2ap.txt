Seed bank - The methodology of this study was defined
from the analysis of several articles. We observed that the
sampling methodology varied widely between studies, especially in relation to
the size of the plots. However, the use of a
quadratic template of 25 cm x 25 cm, collecting only
at a depth of 5 cm, is unanimous among the
different articles analyzed (Braga et al. 2008; Martins et al.
2008; Martins 2009 ; Franco et al. 2012; Cer√≥n 2015;
Correia & Martins 2015; Kunz & Martins 2016). Therefore, in
an attempt to include a greater number of seeds, we
chose to remove the soil at a depth of 0-10
cm, as will be detailed below.
