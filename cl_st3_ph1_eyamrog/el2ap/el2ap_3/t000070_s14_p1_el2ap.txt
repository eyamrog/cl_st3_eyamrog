Physiologically mature capsules of V. reitzii were collected from a
natural population, in the municipality of Curitibanos, Santa Catarina State,
Brazil (27º17'02.7"S, 50º32'05.5" W, 900 m altitude The collection was
carried out at three different times, established by days after
anthesis (DAA), according to the maturation curve, between physiological maturation
and dispersion: 1) at 120 DAA, when the seeds reached
physiological maturation and at the beginning of the reduction in
the content of indoor water; 2) at 135 DAA, intermediate
point of the natural dehydration process and; 3) at 150
DAA, beginning of carpel opening for seed release and dispersion.
The experiments were conducted in the Laboratory of Developmental Physiology
and Plant Genetics (LFDGV), Center of Agricultural Sciences, of the
Federal University of Santa Catarina (CCA/UFSC) in Florianópolis, Santa Catarina
State, Brazil.
