According to the findings, all properties of formulations, combined or
not, were used: preservation, deletion, and transformation; although the majority
of the cases had a predominantly transformative function. The cross-examining
lawyer preserved some of the defendant’s words exactly, for example:
that makes sense in “when you say that makes sense
although it makes sense” (here, the words were preserved deictically
in the second occurrence as that had a grammatical substitute
it). In other moments, he omitted some aspects of the
sense, but he mostly used altered forms in his formulations,
that is, by transforming what the defendant had said, he
offered his own version of what she had said and
invited the listeners to agree with the interpretation that he
had in mind.
