The results of cross-country studies point to the relative efficacy
of CFMs in increasing monetary policy autonomy, stretching the maturity
of external liabilities, and countering credit booms, though this last
goal is mainly reached via macroprudential policies. On the other
hand, the results on the goal of countering pressures on
exchange rate appreciation were mixed, and little evidence exists that
CFMs could effectively reduce the net volume of capital flows.
These results were provided mainly by Magud et al. (2011),
Habermeier et al. (2011), Fern√°ndez et al. (2015), Aizenman and
Binici (2016), Pasricha et al. (2018), and Forbes et al.
(2016). Figure 1 systematizes the common results on the effectiveness
of CFMs found by the joint analysis of these studies.
