Considering a general hedonic model for the house 𝑖 in
years 𝑡, the estimated empirical model is as follows: <>,
where, 𝑃𝑖𝑡 is the price of house 𝑖 in year
𝑡, 𝐶𝐵𝐷𝑖 is the center-house distance, 𝑆𝐵𝐷𝑝,𝑖 are the distances
from house 𝑖 to each SBD candidate (previously identified in
the first state), 𝑍𝑖𝑡 are the intrinsic characteristics of house
𝑖 in 𝑡, 𝐴𝑖 are the distance vector of house
𝑖 to each 𝑙 amenities, 𝑇𝑖 is the distances of
house 𝑖 to each 𝑚 avenues and modes of transportation,
𝐷 is the time dummy vector, 𝜀𝑖𝑡 is the spatially
autocorrelated error and 𝑢𝑖𝑡 is the random error term. Spatial
lags are created by using 𝑤𝑖𝑗 (neighborhood spatial matrix), under
the following conditions: a) 𝑤𝑖𝑗= 0 for 𝑗= 𝑖, b)
0 < 𝑤𝑖𝑗≤1, if 𝑗 is neighbor of 𝑖 and
c) <>, in general, it is equal to one. Therefore,
𝑤𝑖𝑗𝑃𝑖𝑡 is house price spatial lag and 𝑤𝑖𝑗𝑋𝑚,𝑖 is covariates
spatial lag (𝑍𝑘𝑖𝑡, 𝐴𝑙𝑖, 𝑇𝑚𝑖). The coefficients to be estimated
are 𝛼, 𝜌, 𝜃, 𝜏𝑝, 𝛾𝑘, 𝛽𝑙, 𝜅𝑜, 𝜇, 𝜆
e 𝜎𝑢.
