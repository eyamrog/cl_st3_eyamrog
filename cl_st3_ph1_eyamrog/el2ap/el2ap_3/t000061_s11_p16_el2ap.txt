According to Benjamin (apud Buck-Morss, 1995: 290), the loss of
mimetic ability in adult life is determined by the loss
of the ability to perceive similarities non-sensitive, understood as those
that have no rational basis (referring to scientific rationality). Benjamin
(apud Lavelle, 2014: 82) refers to “certain mimetic practices that
characterize children's play and that would have been the foundation
of a magical view of the world in the past”.
He draws a parallel between the devaluation of mimetic behavior
(1) throughout human history, referring to the replacement of this
behavior by the inductive reasoning characteristic of modern science, and
(2) in the individual's life, represented especially by the loss
of capacity of imagination, so present in children's lives through
play. In this relationship, the author sees the school as
the main responsible for the suffocation of the mimetic impulse
in children (Schlesener, 2019).
