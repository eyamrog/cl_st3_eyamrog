Linyphiidae are generally associated with litter, building sheet – shaped
webs close to the ground, and are commonly found to
pitfall traps (Ferro 2008, Ubick et al. 2005). Linyphiidae was
the most abundant family in other works (Ferro 2008, Silva
et al. 2014, Breitenbach et al. 2015). Spiders of this
family prefer the interior of the forest according to Gonçalves-Souza
(2008), corroborating with the obtained data in this study. The
greater number of individuals collected in DA in the hot
and humid seasons of the year, may be associated with
the search for climate protection provided by the leaf density
of H. coronarium, which provides a cooler microenvironment, but further
studies are needed to test this hypothesis.
