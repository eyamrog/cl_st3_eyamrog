Our simulations describe how the mean trait Z evolves in
time (Figure 1a). The values and the description of the
model parameters are depicted in Table 1. Each simulation ends
after 1000 timesteps, an amount of time that is sufficient
to generate asymptotic trait values. In most simulations, however, the
equilibrium was reached before 1000 timesteps. To reduce computational time,
we assumed the equilibrium is achieved if |Zi(t+1) - Zi(t)|<10-4
for every species i, ending the simulation. We run 72.000
simulations, 3.000 per empirical network, where each simulation tracks how
species traits change in time due to coevolution and the
selective pressures from the environment (Figure 1a). All the simulations
were performed in R v. 3.5.3 (R Core Team 2018).
In what follows, we explain how we used this modelling
approach to explore each of our three questions.
