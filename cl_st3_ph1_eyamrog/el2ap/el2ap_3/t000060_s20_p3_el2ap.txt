We observe that the first pair-part of the “question/answer” adjacency
pair is prefaced by the discourse marker so. It is
relevant to note that discourse markers, in this work, are
seen as syntactically independent elements from verbs that can be
formed by one or more lexical items or expressions. They
corroborate the monitoring of conversation as well as the organization
of spoken text. In addition, they are also multifunctional mechanisms
because they can operate as textual organizers and/or articulators, illocutionary
force indicating devices, verbal planners and mitigators, among other functions.
Schiffrin (2001, p. 57) postulates that “discourse markers could be
considered as a set of linguistic expressions comprised of members
of word classes as varied as conjunctions (e.g., and, but,
or), interjections (oh), adverbs (now, then), and lexicalized phrases (y’know,
I mean)”. Semantically, discourse markers exhibit “semantic aptness,” or appropriateness
for the type of discourse marker that they become; more
importantly, their semantic development provides evidence for unidirectionality, for referential
(propositional) meaning being the source for pragmatic (textual and interpersonal)
meanings (Brinton, 2001, p. 149). In the example above, the
discourse marker so is used as topic developer. It occurs
at the beginning of the turn and appears in a
direct question which contributes to encourage the interlocutor to confirm
the speaker’s inference.
