The importance of water content is reported in several studies
and for various plant materials, such as seeds of Punica
granatum L. (Punicaceae) (Silva et al. 2015), seeds of Encholirium
spectabile Martius ex Schultes f. (Bromeliaceae) (Ferrari et al. 2016),
seeds of Pyrostegia venusta (Ker Gawl.) Miers (Salom√£o et al.
2020), as well as seeds, pollen, protocorms, structures similar to
protocorms, apexes extracted from in vitro plants and meristematic tissues
of orchids (Popova et al. 2016).
