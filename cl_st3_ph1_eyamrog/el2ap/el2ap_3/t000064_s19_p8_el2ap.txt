The leaf mesophyll from control group plants was dorsiventral and
composed of 21-25 parenchyma layers, which cells are elongated on
the adaxial side and gradually diminishes in height towards the
abaxial side, getting a rounded shape (figure 6 a, f).
Both in vitro and greenhouse plants had a dorsiventral mesophyll
(figures 6 d-e). Nevertheless, in these plants, the mesophyll presented
a less dense cell arrangement than the mature leaves from
the control (figures 6 a, f). Additionally, each leaf face
of greenhouse, garden and control plants, the mesophyll possessed subepidermal
fibre fascicles, which was more abundant in leaves from the
control and garden plants (figures 6 a, f). Conversely, these
fibre fascicles were not observed in leaves from the in
vitro grown plants (figure 6 d).
