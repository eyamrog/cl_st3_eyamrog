Biodiversity, its conservation, and its responsible use occupy a central
space in current debates on politics, science, and economics. At
the Rio de Janeiro Summit, held in 1992, a discussion
area was dedicated to the problems of the planet's survival,
which resulted in the signing of the Convention on Biological
Diversity.
