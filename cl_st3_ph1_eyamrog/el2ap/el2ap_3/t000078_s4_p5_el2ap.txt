The identification of SBDs is sensitive to geographical scales, as
already pointed out by Anas et al. (1998). Thus, by
changing the weighting areas by districts of the municipality or
gridding the municipality's total area into cells of 1 kmÂ²,
the results can be changed. One way to overcome this
limitation would be to consider the spatial location of each
firm and stress the modifiable areal unit problem. In this
way, the identification of the SBD would not be restricted
to the geographical polygon boundary proposed by the IBGE. Then
it would be possible to identify a corridor-shaped SBD, for
example. If all identified SBD connect to each other, instead
of 7 SBDs we would identify fewer SBD.
