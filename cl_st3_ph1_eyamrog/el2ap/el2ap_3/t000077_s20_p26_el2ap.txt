As for gender, the control of labor activities also led
to some reduction in the coefficient; however, there is an
independent effect, in which men are 2.19 p.p. less likely
to do remote work compared to women. Brussevich et al.
(2020) also find that men, on average, are less likely
to be engaged in work activities that can be performed
remotely compared to women, and that this result is mainly
related to difference in selection into occupations and sectors between
male and female workers. Even so, the existence of a
negative independent effect for men may reflect the fact that,
in Brazil, the gender division in domestic work – family
assistance and child rearing – still mainly affects women. According
to Duarte and Spinelli (2019), in 2017, women worked about
20.9 hours per week in domestic activities and in the
sphere of care, and men, 10.8 hours; with the greater
dedication to household chores by women occurring regardless of the
level of education.
