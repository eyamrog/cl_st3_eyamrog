According to Garrison et al. (1999), “Cognitive presence is a
vital element in critical thinking, a process and outcome that
is frequently presented as the ostensible goal of all higher
education.” (p. 93). This presence can be identified in asynchronous
written communication when students are exchanging information, connecting ideas, and
applying new concepts. According to Garrison et al., cognitive presence
is one of the essential elements in the CoI framework
that are developed through the connections of the participants to
construct meaning through sustained communication.
