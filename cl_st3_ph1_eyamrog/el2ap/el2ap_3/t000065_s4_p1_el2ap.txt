The overall aim of this paper was to present the
rationale behind building an academic learner corpus, making the case
that such a process is paramount for revealing traces of
learners' written interlanguage. The main principles regarding corpus compilation were
presented associated with the design criteria adopted for CorIFA. After
that, we outlined the methodological procedures that were followed in
the compilation process. The texts included in the corpus and
the register associated with the studentsâ€™ proficiency level were also
explained indicating a vast range of topics for future studies.
