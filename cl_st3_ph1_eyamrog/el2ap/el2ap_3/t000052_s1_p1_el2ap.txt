In the framework of the study of Siluriform fish monogeneans
of Lake Tanganyika, we described two new species of Bagrobdella
from Auchenoglanis occidentalis, Bagrobdella vanhovei sp. nov. is characterized by
the morphology of its MCO which is unique (terminal opening)
and Bagrobdella vansteenbergei sp. nov. characterized by the size of
its hooks, which are almost all of the same size,
and its male copulating organ with a unique shape: sub-terminal
opening and no membrane surrounding.
