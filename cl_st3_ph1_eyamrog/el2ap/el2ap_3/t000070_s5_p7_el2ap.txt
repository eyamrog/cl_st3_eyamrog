From these results, it can be inferred that the period
of fruit collection and seed extraction in V. reitzii is
an important factor to observed. Also, the highest percentage of
germination and GSI are related to lower water content, greater
accumulation of reserves, and embryo maturity. These factors were also
observed in the germination in Moringa oleifera Lam. seeds (Agustini
et al. 2015). Data that corroborate with those observed by
Guimar√£es & Barbosa (2007), in which the increase in GSI
in Machaerium brasiliensi Vogel seeds is related to the fruit
maturation process. Therefore, the natural desiccation determines the quality and
vigour of the seeds, an important factor to be considered
in conservation programs, such as the use in cryopreservation.
