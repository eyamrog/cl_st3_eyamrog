The vygotskian perspective, which underlines the action of the other
in the action of oneself, was also present in this
activity, as this perspective highlights collaboration as a space for
the co-construction of knowledge. It is important to mention that
there is no hierarchy in the roles played (Magalh√£es &
Fidalgo, 2019), which tends to boost stronger interdependence and shared
responsibility in the search for a common goal, a sine
qua non condition for a successful collaborative work.
