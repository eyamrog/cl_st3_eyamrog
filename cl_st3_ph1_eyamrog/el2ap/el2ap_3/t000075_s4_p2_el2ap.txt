Therefore, these new ex-post models may mark a new phase
in the theoretical mainstream and orthodox perspective on capital account
liberalization and capital controls. This change recognizes that reality is
right; that is, it was not the theory that was
right and the reality wrong. From this perspective, it is
possible to affirm that the new mainstream models represent a
new phase in its theoretical approach on the regulation of
capital flows. Currently, capital controls are admitted with fewer restrictions
by the mainstream economics, being conceived as important instruments available
to central banks.
