Besides this introduction, the paper is organized into five sections.
The next section discusses the monocentric and polycentric city, underlining
the employment decentralization process. The third section shows the econometric
identification strategy in two stages, the estimated results and SBD
characterization. After the main results, we discuss robustness tests. The
last section provides final remarks, extension possibilities, and limitations.
