Aizenman and Binici (2016) provide another important contribution to this
subject. The authors analyze the pressure of capital flows and
CFMs on the exchange rate and the international reserves of
emerging and OECD countries for the 2000-2014 period; that is,
the impact of these factors on countries’ ‘exchange market pressure’
(EMP). The main results show that the imposition of CFMs
by OECD countries relieved some of other pro-cyclical pressures on
these countries’ EMP, such that the regulatory measures imposed on
inflows were significantly stronger than the ones imposed on capital
outflows. However, the imposition of CFMs by emerging countries did
not significantly soften the pro-cyclical pressures of short-term capital flows
on these economies’ EMP, despite the fact that emerging economies
resorted to these regulatory measures more frequently and intensively. According
to Aizenman and Binici (2016, p. 86), ‘While capital controls
may mitigate the exposure, the efficacy of this mitigation depends
on the quality of institutions and may be greater for
OECD countries than for more vulnerable EME.’
