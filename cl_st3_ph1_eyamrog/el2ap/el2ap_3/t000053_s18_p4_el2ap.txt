To review bibliographic material, the following online databases were used:
PubMed, Google Scholar, SciELO, BVS - Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde,
using the following terms: "Acre" AND ("sand fly" OR "sandfly"
OR "sandflies" OR “sand flies” OR “Phlebotominae”) and, therefore, the
first word was mandatory and the others had to appear
in one of the ways described. Bibliographic references cited in
scientific articles were also used as data sources.
