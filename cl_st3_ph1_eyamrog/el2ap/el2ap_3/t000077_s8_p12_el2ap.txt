Because the health and economic crisis related to Covid-19 is
an unprecedented crisis, there is a new and rapidly growing
segment of literature dedicated to assessing its various effects. Regarding
the effects on the labor market, a line of research
that has been highly active addresses the uneven effects of
the negative shock related to Coronavirus. There is already a
consensus that this effect is uneven and may increase pre-existing
inequalities. Adams-Prassl et al. (2020) analyzed evidence for the UK,
US and Germany and found that the probabilities of reducing
hours worked, losing jobs and suffering earning reductions are greater
for workers in alternative work arrangements and in occupations in
which only a small share of tasks can be done
from home, for those with less schooling and for women.
The results of Montenovo et al. (2020) for the United
States also show that job losses were greater for occupations
that require interpersonal contact and, therefore, cannot be done remotely.
Gallacher and Hossain (2020), analyzing the Canadian labor market, found
that the most intense job losses between March and April
were for workers with lesser possibilities for working from home.
