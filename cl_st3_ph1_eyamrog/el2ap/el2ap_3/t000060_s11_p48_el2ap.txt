An individual protects face when his line is consistent with
that expected by the other participants; in other words, when
he shows an image which is based on interactantsâ€™ assumptions
and judgments, approved by the line adopted by the speaker.
Face is not housed within or on the surface of
its owner, but it is widespread in the flow of
events of the encounters, and it occurs when participants are
willing to decode the judgments expressed in these events.
