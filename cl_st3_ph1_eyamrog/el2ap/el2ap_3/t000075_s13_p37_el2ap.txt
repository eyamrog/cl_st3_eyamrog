When it comes to currency wars, which are characterized by
successive impositions of capital controls by emerging economies hit by
spillover effects, Ostry et al. (2012) argue that the unilateral
imposition of capital controls in such scenario is no longer
Pareto efficient in correcting the externalities provoked by an excessive
external indebtedness, as in Korinek (2011). Therefore, the coordination of
capital controls among capital recipient countries can potentially soften these
currency wars. In addition to reduce the convex costs associated
to the unilateral imposition of these regulatory measures, Korinek (2012)
proposes a coordination that takes into account the influence that
each economy exercises on international interest rates. Following his model,
such influence is compound by the capital flows and the
current account balance of each country, so that the capital
outflows from advanced economies should be subjected to greater intensity
of controls. However, Ostry et al. (2012) correctly point out
that unlike the emerging economies, capital source economies do not
have an explicit incentive to resort to tighter regulation on
their capital outflows, because their private agents’ utility functions are
not constrained by the ‘costly controls’ component. A possible argument
to convince capital source economies to increase the intensity of
regulation on their capital outflows is that this kind of
coordination can avoid future financial crises in emerging economies, what
in turn would bring losses to the financial institutions based
on developed countries (Ostry et al., 2012).
