“I started working with the coronavirus, doing research to find
treatment for people. So, I have worked with chloroquine and
ivermectin, which are two very famous drugs here in Brazil,
but they didn’t work, so don’t take chloroquine and ivermectin!
Also, we’re trying to find drugs that really work for
that. It’s very hard, you know, because we need to
do the research for a long time to see if
it works or not. So, that’s it. I’m in the
front line.”
