Of the many definitions of the term biodiversity, the one
adopted at this event is the most comprehensive, considering it
as: “(…) the variability of living organisms from any source,
including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and
the ecological complexes of which they are part; includes diversity
within species, between species, and of ecosystems” (Naciones Unidas 1992:3).
