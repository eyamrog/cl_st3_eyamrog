For this specific workshop the facilitators chose to offer a
play and talk session in a way participants would feel
more comfortable to use English in a combination of settings,
rather than a one-hour lecture, which is not a GPB
practice. However, there was a chance that such lecture would
take place because of learnersâ€™ inhibitions, as the learners who
were taking part in the workshop were not familiar with
interacting with strangers in English. There were five interconnected activities
that involved play and talk, so that core principles such
as collaboration, affect, and agency could somehow be addressed in
the talk and shared in the play settings.
