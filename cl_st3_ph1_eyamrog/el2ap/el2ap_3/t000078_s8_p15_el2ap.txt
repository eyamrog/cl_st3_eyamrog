McMillen (2001a, 2001b) proposed a two-stage model that requires no
prior knowledge of the evaluated city. The first stage is
close to Craig and Ng (2001) approach, i.e., run employment
density logarithm against the distance to the CBD. SBD candidates
are those whose residues form clusters statistically significant at 5%.
In the second stage, after considering the potential subcenters, a
semiparametric model is used. The nonparametric part of the regression
adjusted by a flexible Fourier approximation uses the residuals of
the first stage as a dependent variable and the distance
to the CBD as an explanatory variable. Statistically significant estimated
distance coefficients are considered SBD.
