Drew (2003, p. 296) asserts that formulations “serve to perform
specific interactional tasks which vary according to the setting”. They
are a generic mechanism in the interaction, however, the ways
through which they are presented are related to the activities
they manage in specific situations. These devices are therefore multifunctional
as they play many different interactional roles in many different
contexts.
