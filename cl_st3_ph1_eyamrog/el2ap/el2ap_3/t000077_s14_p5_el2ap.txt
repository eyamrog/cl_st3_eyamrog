As for the empirical model, we used Probit models to
estimate the conditional probability of working from home for individual
𝑖 given several observable characteristics (𝑦𝑖= 1|𝒙𝒊). We used this
class of models since OLS regressions ignore the discreteness of
the dependent variable and there is no constrain for probabilities
to be between zero and one. Following Cameron and Trivedi
(2005), Probit model specifies 0 < 𝑝𝑖< 1 as in
eq. (1): <> where Φ is the cumulative distribution function
for the standard normal and 𝑥𝑖 indicates the vector of
covariates described in Table 2. The Probit model marginal effects
are (2): <>
