Such differences implies the following practical consequences: from the Keynesian
perspective, the use of capital controls should be conceived as
a permanent instrument of economics policy, given the fact that
currency inconvertibility may remain for undetermined time. From the major
orthodox perspective, in turn, capital controls and macroprudential policies should
be used sporadically â€“ more specifically when facing a surge
in capital inflows that could potentially increase financial risks and
promote an exchange overvaluation.
