The term “hedge” adopted in this research was coined by
Brown and Levinson (1987, p. 145): “the particle, word or
phrase that modifies the degree of membership of a predicate
or noun phrase in the set; it says of membership
that it is partial, or true only in certain respects,
or that it is more true and complete than might
be expected”. In addition, we can see another mitigation device
why don’t you restate in “why don’t you just restate
the question that you technically asked her”. It reduces the
force of an imperative verb such as restate and makes
the request more polite, protecting therefore the speaker’s positive face.
