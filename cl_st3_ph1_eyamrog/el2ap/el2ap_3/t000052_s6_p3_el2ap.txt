Bagrobdella vanhovei and B. vansteenbergei are both new to science
and endemic to Lake Tanganyika. However, the 4 species of
Bagrobdella already known have been described in different localities: B.
auchenoglanii has been described in Ghana (with itâ€™s redescription done
on individuals sampled in Mali and Togo), B. anthopenis in
Mali, B. fraudulenta in Uganda and Mali (see Euzet and
Le Brun 1990) and recently B. parauchenoglani in Cameroon (Akoumba
et al. 2017).
