The mutualism component, Smi is defined as the sum of
selective effects caused by all mutualistic partners of species i.
We assume that selection imposed by mutualism favors trait matching
among mutualistic partners. We also assume that perfect trait matching
between partners i and j occurs if |Zj(t)-Zi(t)| = 0
(Guimar√£es et al. 2011). A given species may have multiple
mutualistic partners and each partner may contribute differently to selection,
where the contribution of partner j to selection on species
i is described by mij(t). The total contribution of mutualistic
partners to selection on Zi is defined as: <>
