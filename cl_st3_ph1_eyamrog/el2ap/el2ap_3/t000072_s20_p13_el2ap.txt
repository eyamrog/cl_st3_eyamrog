Regarding the occurrence in phytophysiognomy of the total number of
species identified here (29), eleven have been reported for both
semideciduous and riparian forest, seven species have reported for only
semideciduous forest, two species have an occurrence reported only for
riparian forest and nine species have no reported occurrence for
these phytophysiognomies, according to Flora do Brasil 2020 (2021). Considering
that the study area is a region of riparian forest
continuous to a fragment of semideciduous forest, these data suggest
that the influence of the fragment may have a great
influence on the diversity of species that make up the
riparian forest in question. It is important to highlight that
this type of information is not always recorded on labels
of exsiccates deposited in herbariums and that a significant part
of the information about the occurrence in phytophysiognomies of the
species of angiosperms present in Flora do Brasil 2020 (2021)
may have been obtained in this way. This may justify
the high number of species occurring in the present study
not previously reported for semideciduous and riparian forest.
