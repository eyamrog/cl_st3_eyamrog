The gills were examined under a Wild Heerbrugg® M8 binocular.
The monogeneans were recovered using an entomologist needle and some
individuals were mounted in a drop of Hoyer’s medium (Anderson
1954) on a slide, then covered with a coverslip to
‘flatten’ the specimen. The slides were left to dry for
24 hours in horizontal position before sealing the coverslip with
Glyceel (Bates 1997). Other individuals were mounted using tap water
and identified under a Leica® DM 2500 microscope equipped with
a digital camera (Leica DMC 4500), after identification, the monogeneans
were individually stored in Eppendorf® tubes in 96% ethanol for
subsequent genetic studies.
