Based on that workshop, this paper aims to discuss some
theoretical and practical concepts, namely collaboration and play, which are
key to the GPB and thus essential to the session
offered as well. Collaboration, grounded in the Critical Collaborative Research
(Magalh√£es & Fidalgo, 2019), highlights co-authorship and co-construction among all
the participants involved in a certain activity. In this play
session, for example, participants mutually collaborated in the activities proposed
by exchanging their own experience, interacting with the resources available,
and understanding that the way everyone is affected by the
diversity in the group is essential for collective growth.
