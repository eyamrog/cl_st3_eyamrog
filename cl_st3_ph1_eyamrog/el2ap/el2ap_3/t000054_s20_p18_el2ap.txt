Mescaline has aroused interest for its pharmacological use in the
treatment of headache, depression, obsession, anxiety, and addiction to some
substances such as alcohol, in particular because the propensity to
become dependent on mescaline is practically non-existent, and intoxications with
this substance are moderate and not life-threatening (Dinis-Oliveira, Lan√ßa &
Dias 2019).
