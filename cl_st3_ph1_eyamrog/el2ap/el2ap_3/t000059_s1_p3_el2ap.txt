Results: The study included 568 journals, with a median size
of 166 signed articles. The median PPMP was 4.5% (95th
percentile 12.9%), and the median Gini coefficient was 0.149 (95th
percentile 0.310). The PPMP increased with journal size, while the
Gini coefficient decreased. MEDLINE journals had lower PPMP and higher
Gini coefficients, but this difference disappeared after the data were
reweighted.
