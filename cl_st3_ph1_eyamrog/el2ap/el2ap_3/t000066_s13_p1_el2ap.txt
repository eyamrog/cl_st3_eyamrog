As the GPB launch happened on June 8, 2020, workshops
started to be offered and Brigadiers could join any of
the weekly meetings to exchange ideas, experience some improvisational games,
play and performance tools or social therapy sessions themselves. This
provided them with some emotional growth and support to carry
on the activities and actions announced on the GPB website.
During such meetings, Brigadiers also had a chance to partner
with (an)other Brigadier(s) to discuss their plans for a session
they decided on facilitating. In one of these meetings, two
Brigadiers who worked as English professors in government owned colleges
in the state of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, decided to team
up with another colleague in the same institution to offer
a workshop entitled Global Collaboration: What can young professionals do?
