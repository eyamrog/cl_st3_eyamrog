Such need is one of the principles that motivated the
Global Play Brigade (GPB)1 to bring together artists, improvisers, educators,
musicians, clowns, therapists, and other activists from almost 40 countries
to offer free online workshops to people across the globe.
Once ZOOM, WhatsApp, and Facebook were some of the technological
tools that could connect people back in March of 2020,
when the pandemic spread worldwide, these activists, better known as
Brigadiers, launched a website with a vast list of activities
available to anyone who was struggling to keep social distancing
measures and somehow became related to the topics addressed.
