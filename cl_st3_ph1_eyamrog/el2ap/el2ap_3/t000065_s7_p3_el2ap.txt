This empirical approach allows results to be generalized, as a
well-designed corpus will adequately represent a register, which can be
understood as “a variety associated with a particular situation of
use (including particular communicative purposes)” (Biber & Conrad, 2009, p.
6). The researcher, then, should consider the situational characteristics of
a register: the participants, the relations among participants, the channel
used, and the production circumstances (Biber & Conrad, 2009). Having
established clear research questions to answer and the characteristics of
the register or registers the linguist is interested in investigating,
it is time to choose the corpus to be used.
Would a readily available corpus be suitable, or would a
corpus compilation be necessary?
