This research indicated that Hedychium coronarium does not directly impact
the population dynamics of soil spider assemblages. Despite the significant
differences, not having been recovered in post-hoc, larger studies may
point to impacts when studying groups of lesser behavioral complexity,
such as guilds, families, and species. Weaver spiders have a
preference for IA, however, Linyphiidae has different preferences influenced according
to the periods of the year. Runner spiders, on the
other hand, showed preference for DA throughout the year. Studies
on this type of ecological relationship in preserved sites are
necessary to complement the information available here, since there are
invasions of H. coronarium in many conservation units in Brazil
and the understanding of relationships like these can help in
the protection of species, mainly predatory arthropods such as spiders
that are important controllers of insect populations.
