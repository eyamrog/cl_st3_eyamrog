In this regard, V. reitzii seeds could be a plausible
material for the conservation of germplasm with great genetic diversity
and with protocols already established for large-scale propagation. Thus, the
objective of the present work was to evaluate the viability,
cell integrity, and presence of polysaccharides in V. reitzii cryopreserved
and non-cryopreserved seeds using anatomical, biochemical and ultrastructural analyzes.
