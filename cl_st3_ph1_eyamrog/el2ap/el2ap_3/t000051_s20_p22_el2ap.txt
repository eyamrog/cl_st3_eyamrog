Based on this conclusion, Scholz constructs a discourse of threat
to national security, which is proximal not-yet-spoken and latent. The
war in Ukraine, stripped of all its prehistory, is presented
as an act of aggression to start building an empire
that may eventually entail Germany. Such a threat to national
security is constructed, first, through the rhetorical question of what
capabilities Putin’s Russia possesses and what “we” need “um dieser
Bedrohung zu begegnen, heute und in der Zukunft” (‘to counter
this threat, today and in the future’), which makes clear
that Scholz envisages a lasting conflict with Russia that may
entail the (alleged) need for Germany to acquire nuclear arms.
The rhetorical question is left open and Scholz uses the
dialogically contractive pronouncement “Klar ist” (‘it is clear’) to assert
that, if one thing is clear, it is that Germany
must invest much more in the security of the country,
in order to protect “unsere Freiheit und unsere Demokratie” (‘our
freedom and our democracy’). The second manifestation of the threat
to national security discourse again picks up the Germany as
military power discourse, latently present in the assertion that a
functioning army is “ja wohl erreichbar für ein Land unserer
Größe und unserer Bedeutung in Europa” (‘quite certainly something that
a country of our size and our significance within Europe
should be able to achieve’).
