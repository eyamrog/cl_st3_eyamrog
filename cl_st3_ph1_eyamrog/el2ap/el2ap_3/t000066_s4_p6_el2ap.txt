In Freire’s perspective (1970), the viable unheard of can be
traced in some active movements in communities, for example, as
the GPB and in other programs that expand those principles
to local needs such as Brincadas, the way that LACE
Research Group ressignified GPB’s principles in the Brazilian context. This
aspect also exposes the multidisciplinary vein of AL, which has
been the theoretical and methodological framework for LACE over the
years. It is crucial for this group to align language
research to social engagement as a part of the continuous
learning process everyone’s in, but also as a provocative and
responsive action towards individual and collective transformation.
