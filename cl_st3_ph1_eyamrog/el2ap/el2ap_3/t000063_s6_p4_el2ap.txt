For the first year of the pandemic (school year 2020-2021)
there was an increase in applications for health sciences (17%)
and natural sciences, math and statistics (22%) careers which represented
a higher increase than seen for other fields of study
(7%) from the previous, pre-pandemic school year 2019-2020. However, although
applications were higher for this first year of the pandemic
in both fields of study, the enrollment was limited in
part by the availability of spots, resulting in a 6%
decrease in first year health science students and a 4%
increase in science careers. It is important to understand this
disparity and the variables affecting this process. So far, there
is a clear increase in demand in both fields, but
interesting to note is the slight increase in science enrollment
and the larger decrease in health enrollment.
