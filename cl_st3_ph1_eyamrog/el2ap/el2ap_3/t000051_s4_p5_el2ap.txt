To conclude, this article has demonstrated the strengths of Bakhtinian
dialogism applied to discourse analysis, specifically through an operationalisation of
the concept of centripetal-centrifugal struggle. It shows how powerful, centred
discourses are mobilised in a political speech to exclude marginalised
discourses justify a previously unthinkable paradigm shift in foreign policies
and military spending. The method is especially useful for global
analyses where particular discourses and ideologies, mainly of Western origin,
are taken for granted.
