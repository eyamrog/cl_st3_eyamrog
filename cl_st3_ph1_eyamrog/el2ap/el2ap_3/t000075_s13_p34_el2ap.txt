Facing the empirical literature on the relative effectiveness of capital
controls, orthodox models aimed to theoretically explain why some controls
reached their aims more frequently than others did. One of
the main studies to formalize this new economics of capital
controls was by Magud et al. (2011). The authors first
assume that countries impose capital controls to reach four goals:
reduce short-term capital inflows (hot money); reduce the large magnitude
in capital inflows, which can bring financial risks; smooth the
pressure of exchange rate appreciation; and increase the degree of
monetary policy autonomy. Capital controls can be efficient in reducing
the volume of short-term debt, and therefore stretch the maturity
of external liabilities, as well as increasing monetary policy autonomy
if the elasticity of short-term inflows in relation to the
sum of external liabilities is above one. In this way,
the imposition of capital controls would lead to a relative
reduction in short-term inflows compared to total external liabilities. An
increase in monetary policy autonomy would also characterize this scenario
since the controls would create a wedge in the interest
rate differential between external short-term and long-term liabilities (Magud et
al., 2011).
