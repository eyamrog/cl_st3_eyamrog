Play (Vygotsky, 2001; Holzman, 2009), another key concept to this
discussion, provides encounters in which participants have to deal with
rules, the unknown in an online context, and some agency
according to the conflicts raised in the session. As such,
this paper discusses and exemplifies how participants could experience these
principles, just as they were thought out in the workshop
plan and later referred to by participants in certain moments
in the session. By aligning these concepts to some of
the testimonials, we can infer that play is a powerful
intervention resource to create what Freire (1970) proposed as the
viable unheard of, that is, the potential to transform reality.
