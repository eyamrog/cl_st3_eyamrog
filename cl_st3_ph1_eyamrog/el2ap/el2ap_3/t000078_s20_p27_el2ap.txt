The Pinheiros region is the only one losing statistical significance
when the weight matrices are changed, but the signal stays
as expected. In this model, the Morumbi district (A9), an
adjacent neighbor of Pinheiros, presents a statistically significant effect with
the expected signal. It is impossible to test if the
subcenter is on the census tract border of both regions,
and we do not consider that this slight difference in
just one model is that important. Then, we continue advocating
to characterize Pinheiros as a business subcentrality.
