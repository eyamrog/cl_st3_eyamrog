Research has been used in many cases as an excuse
for the appropriation, by scientific institutions and private companies, of
the resources that biodiversity offers, for their use in modern
scientific programs and on some occasions to hold a monopoly
on that biodiversity (Toro 2007). In this way, attempts have
been made to kidnap, with greater or lesser success, the
natural resources of Latin American biodiversity in order to use
them for business interests.
