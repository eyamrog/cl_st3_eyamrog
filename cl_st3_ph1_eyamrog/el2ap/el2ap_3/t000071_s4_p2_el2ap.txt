What this study adds to the considerable literature on predatory
journals is both evidence and reason for addressing the underlying
issues of transparency. By developing verification systems for publishing platforms
involving trusted trade organizations, the bar is raised for both
those operating predatory journals and those (mis)applying the label. While
PKP is taking the lead with these systems, we recognize
that their effectiveness will depend on their adoption as an
industry standard for journal accountability across publishers and publishing platforms.
This will involve a wide range of journal platforms and
scholarly publishers that share a common goal of assisting the
public in assessing the trustworthiness of research publications, given their
growing open access to research. These standards for verification and
authentication, especially as they are attuned to communicating to the
public, as well as professionals, the publishing practices that distinguish
scholarly publishing, will raise the bar for both legitimate and
deceptive journals.
