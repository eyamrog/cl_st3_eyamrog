In Spinoza's Ethics, affectus are seen as the continuous variation
of the power of acting, (Spinoza, 2003, III, Def. 3),
generated by the affectio or modifications suffered in the body,
whose effects are translated by affectus. Depending on the composition
of relations among bodies, the affectus can be active, when
it expresses the passage to a greater perfection (joy), or
passive, when it expresses the opposite movement (sadness). The increase
or the decrease in a person's power of acting (to
be and act) - conatus - comes from encounters. Thus,
encounters may broaden or reduce a personâ€™s power of acting.
