Finally, among the families with the greatest diversity of species
is Urticaceae, represented in Brazil by 14 genera and about
116 species (Gaglioti et al. 2020). The species are characterized
by their accelerated growth, short life cycle, reaching small and
medium sizes (Parrota 1995). Most of these species need solar
incidence in order to develop (Godoi & Tanaki 2005) and
therefore border areas, as well as clearings in the interior
of the forests, are regions with a high incidence of
these species. Generally, in the soil of primary or secondary
tropical forests there is a large number of seeds of
this family, mainly those of Cecropia spp. (Lobova et al.
2003).
