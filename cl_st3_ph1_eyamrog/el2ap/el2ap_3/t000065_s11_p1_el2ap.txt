Types of English spoken as an additional language10 far outnumber
native-speaker varieties11 inspiring the study of non-native spoken or written
English. This is the focus of ‘learner corpus research’12 (LCR),
an umbrella term (Granger et al., 2015) to refer to
interlanguage investigations that are based on corpus linguistics. A corpus
is a “collection of pieces of language text in electronic
form” (Sinclair, 2005: 19) compiled according to some criteria, and
representing a language or language variety. Corpus compilation requires establishing
precise and broadly-inclusive criteria for the consideration of the mode
(e.g.,written), the type (e.g.,a research article) and the domain (e.g.,
academic) of the texts, the language or language varieties (e.g.,learner
English), location of texts (e.g.,compiled in Brazil) and text production
dates (e.g., from 2015-2020), according to Sinclair (2005). With a
focus on description of language use, corpus linguistics, using a
range of linguistic software tools, allows both quantitative and qualitative
approaches to learner language. Among its advantages are the capacity
to deal with a considerable amount of data, and generalizability
of results across similar groups. A well- designed corpus, therefore,
is representative of a population. As Biber points out:
