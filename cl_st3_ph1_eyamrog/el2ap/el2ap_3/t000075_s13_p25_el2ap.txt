In other words, this methodology indicates that permanent capital controls
were more efficient than are sporadic capital controls, which were
imposed mostly by middle income countries over the sample period
(Fern√°ndez et al., 2016). One of the main criteria underlying
the effectiveness of these controls is that due to the
high co-movement (correlation) between the controls imposed on inflows and
outflows, there was a strong regulatory and administrative capacity to
avoid, or at least to soften, capital control evasion.
