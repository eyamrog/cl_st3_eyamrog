Amazonian phlebotomine fauna is considered one of the most diverse
in the world. In addition, the region is the most
prevalent for leishmaniasis in Brazil and South America. The state
of Acre, which belongs to this region, also stands out
in terms of the diversity of the sand fly fauna,
as well as the occurrence of American tegumentary leishmaniasis. In
this context, the present Dataset comprise a bibliographic review of
sand fly species recorded in Acre State, Amazon region, Brazil.
A total of 1,096 observations from Material Citation type (and
two of preserved specimens) were presented using 32 variables according
to Darwin Core terms. The bibliographic review was performed in
PubMed, Google Scholar, SciELO, BVS (Biblioteca Virtual em Sa√∫de) and
bibliographic references cited in related scientific articles. Thus, the present
study is a solid report for further studies on sand
fly studies in Acre and other Amazon states.
