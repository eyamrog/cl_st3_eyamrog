Martinez threatens Arias’s negative face by trying to invalidate her
version about the time the events had happened and showing
how imprecise her statements are. Through the formulations “the way
you’re saying is... you’re saying it could be... six o’clock
in the evening and you’re telling us it was... surely
after after two o‘clock”, he shows that she does not
give any specific information, and it can be interpreted in
many ways (six o’clock in the evening, for example) because
of her unclear answers. He attempts to show her contradiction
by using her own statement, reinforced by the discourse marker
right (based on that statement right?), aiming at confirmation.
