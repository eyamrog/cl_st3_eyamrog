The data associated with the biological specimens deposited in FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB
are of importance because they describe the distribution of sand
flies in different parts of Brazil and have a good
temporal coverage since some specimensâ€™ date back from 1939 and
the last deposit was recorded in 2021. The data can
be used for many different applications, from different research areas
(taxonomy and systematics [5,6,7], ecological niche modelling [8], among other
applications [9]) to vector control activities [16,17].
