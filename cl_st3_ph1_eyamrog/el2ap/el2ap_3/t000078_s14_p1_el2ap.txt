The definition of SBD candidate areas is based on the
ESDA technique, consisting of the first stage estimation strategy. From
this approach, it is possible to obtain measures of global
and local spatial autocorrelation. While the Global Moran’s I statistic
allows us to test the spatial association pattern of jobs
(by weighting area) for the whole sample, the Local Moran’s
I makes it possible to decompose the spatial association regime.
The decomposition associate clusters of type HH (high-high), HL (low-low),
LH (low-high) and LL (low-low). This is possible because, for
each observation of the sample, a specific Moran’s I is
computed, that is, 𝐼𝑖 (where 𝑖 is the evaluated region
and 𝑖= 1, … , 𝐼) (Anselin, 1995). Algebraically, <>,
where 𝑧𝑖 is the employment deviation by Census tract 𝑖;
𝑊𝑧𝑖 is the average value of employment level deviations in
the neighboring tract zones of 𝑖 and 𝜎2 is the
variance of the value deviation. For inference, the method uses
random permutation.
