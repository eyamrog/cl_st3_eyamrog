Biological collections are repositories of biodiversity that house specimens, and
information about those specimens, which can be used in various
areas of scientific research [1], and are especially important for
insects of medical and veterinary importance, where accurate taxonomic identification
of the latter is necessary for understanding and intervening in
the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases [2]. The “Coleção de Flebotomíneos”
(the “Collection of Phlebotomines” as it is called in Portuguese)
– held at the Instituto René Rachou, Fiocruz Minas (FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB),
a federal public health research institution in the city of
Belo Horizonte, in the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil
– is a biological collection of sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae,
Phlebotominae): small insects of considerable medical and public health importance
because their blood-feeding adult females transmit protozoan parasites of the
genus Leishmania, the etiological agent of leishmaniases, in addition to
other bacterial and viral pathogens, which infect both human and
non-human vertebrates [3]. The insect specimens deposited in FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB come
from many different research projects carried out over the last
80 years or so in many different areas of disease
transmission, and also from wild environments where there are no
records of the disease. The deposited sand flies were usually
collected in light traps and are identified by highly-trained specialists
using the available taxonomic keys [2,4]. The specimens can support
research in the areas of taxonomy and systematics [5,6,7], and
the associated data can be used, for example, in ecological
niche / species distribution modelling [8], among other applications [9].
