Regarding the leaf transpiration rates, the leaves of the plants
of either the garden or inside the greenhouse showed differences
compared to the wild plants, suggesting that the youthfulness of
the plant is a factor that interferes with the physiological
parameter of the leaves. Compared to other Cerrado species (Palhares
et al. 2010), the adult wild plants of V. squamata
showed a low water use efficiency. In this way, the
leaves of the younger plants (of garden and greenhouse) presented
a lower carbon assimilation rate but a better water use
efficiency. Regarding the plantlets of in vitro condition, the higher
transpiration rate is common to in vitro plantlets overall. The
epidermis and stomata are poorly developed, both structurally and functionally,
hence the control of the transpiration is weak, and this
is one of the stressing factors during transition from in
vitro to greenhouse growth (Van Huylenbroeck et al. 1998, Amancio
et al. 1999, Kaur 2015).
