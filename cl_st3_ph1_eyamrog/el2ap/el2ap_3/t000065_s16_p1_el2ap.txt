According to Reppen (2010, p. 33), building a corpus requires
a significant time investment as it involves a set of
highly interconnected procedures. From collecting the texts to saving, storing,
marking-up and adding metadata, the researcher is faced with a
vast number of decisions that need to be considered when
compiling a corpus. CorIFA was originally created in 2013 at
a Brazilian public university. An overview of its compilation history,
challenges and shifts is presented in this section. Above all,
the corpus objective has remained the same: to describe Brazilian
university studentsâ€™ written English interlanguage, as produced in a pedagogical
context.
