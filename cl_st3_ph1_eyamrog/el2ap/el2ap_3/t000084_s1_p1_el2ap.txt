With the ever-growing interest in WhatsApp as a social space
to accommodate pedagogical initiatives, the role of emojis as an
emergent Internet language in this social space needs to be
better understood as mobile technologies have been integrated in education.
With that in mind, this paper reports a study that
employed an embedded correlational mixed methods design, and aimed to
identify: the emojis used to support cognitive, teaching, and social
presences in a teacher education course via WhatsApp; participants’ attitudes
regarding the use of emojis, and their age and gender
relation to this use. The data generated from the interactions
of the teachers via WhatsApp were analyzed and discussed based
on Garrison et al.’s (1999) Community of Inquiry Model. This
conceptual framework identifies crucial elements for successful online educational experiences
and assumes learning occurs through the interaction of three core
elements: social, cognitive and teaching presences. The findings show that
emojis can effectively be used to support teaching, cognitive, and
social presences. The high frequency of emojis seem to be
both culturally situated and gender related.
