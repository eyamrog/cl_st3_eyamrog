The seedlass emergency method (Simpson et al. 1989) was used
for seed bank analysis, monitoring them every 15 days for
six months. For the best identification of individuals, those who
presented an arbustive and arboreal character were peaked to tubes
to develop. For the identification of the seedlings some species
identification guides, such as Lorenzi (2014) and Brancalion & Nogueira
(2016) were used. The exsiccates of the seedlings of the
recognized species were made, deposited in the herbarium of Universidade
Federal de SÃ£o Carlos, Campus Araras.
