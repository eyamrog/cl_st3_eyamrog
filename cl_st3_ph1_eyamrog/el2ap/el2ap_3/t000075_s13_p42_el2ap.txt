Moreover, capital controls were relatively more efficient in increasing the
maturity of external liabilities and monetary policy autonomy during the
period up to global financial crisis in 2007-2008. The capital
controls imposed in the post-crisis period, which was characterized by
global low interest rates, were less effective and had stronger
spillover effects, according to results in Pasricha et al. (2018)
and Forbes et al. (2016), and the model by Korinek
(2012).
