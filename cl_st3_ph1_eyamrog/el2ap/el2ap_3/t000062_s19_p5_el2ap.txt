Considering the total number of collected individuals (youth and adults),
the data have a normal distribution, and no difference was
by the ANOVA test was detected (F- value = 0,414;
P-value = 0,678) and the p-values in the Simpson Diversity
t test were greater than 0.5. There are no significant
differences in comparisons between treatments, corroborated by the Tukey HSD
statistical test and the sampled data in each treatment are
normally distributed according to the Shapiro - Wilk normality test
(W-test) (table 2).
