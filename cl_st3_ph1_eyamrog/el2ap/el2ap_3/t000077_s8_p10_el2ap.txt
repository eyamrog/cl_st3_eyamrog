Understanding how these impacts are distributed across the labor market
is essential to guide the decisions of policy makers. The
relevance of this analysis is amplified by the high degree
of informality and presence of low-paid jobs as well as
by the precarious living conditions of a large part of
the population in the pre-pandemic scenario. In the first quarter
of 2020, 19% of the employed population in Brazil were
waged workers without a formal contract and 21% were employers,
or self-employed, without registration with the National Registry of Legal
Entities (CNPJ, in Portuguese) (Continuous National Household Sample Survey -
IBGE/PNADC, 2020). In 2018, 25.3% of the population had incomes
below US$ 5.50 PPP per day â€“ a value suggested
by the World Bank to classify people at poverty level
in countries with medium-high income (IBGE, 2019).
