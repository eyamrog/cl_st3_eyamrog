The Annonaceae family is made up of about 2,500 species
that grow naturally or are cultivated in the tropical regions
of America, Asia, and Madagascar (Gonz√°lez 2013), but many of
these species are native to Latin America, mainly Ecuador, Peru,
and Brazil. It is therefore noteworthy that most of the
studies on the antitumor potential of acetogenins and their application
in pharmacology have been carried out in laboratories in Europe,
the USA and Asia.
