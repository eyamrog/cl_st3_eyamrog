We conducted this study to understand if the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic changed the perception that adolescents in Mexico had for
science, scientists and health care workers, if it inspired them
to change their career choices and if there was an
increase in first year college applications and enrollment in Mexican
Universities on scientific and health care careers.
