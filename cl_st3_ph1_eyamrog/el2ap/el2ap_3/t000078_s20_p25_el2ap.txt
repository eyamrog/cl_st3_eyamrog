From Table 5 (columns 13-20), one can conclude that the
signs and significance of the estimated coefficients remain statistically significant,
and the signals keep going against the theoretical approach for
both spatial weight matrices and functional forms. These results support
the internal validity of the estimates and underline the hypothesis
that the model is biased when omitting SBD controls. For
the log-level functional form and quadratic specification of the CBD
variable, the estimated coefficient is not sensitive to the changes
of the spatial weight matrices. This result provides additional evidence
against models that use the quadratic form of CBD as
a control.
