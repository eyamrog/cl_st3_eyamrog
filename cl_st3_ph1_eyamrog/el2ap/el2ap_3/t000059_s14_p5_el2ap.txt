For better comparison, data from Scanff and colleagues (2021) were
reweighted so that journal sizes would have the same distribution
as among LILACS journals. The present study did not include
a sensitivity analysis restricting data to the research articles, because
the former study found the results to be largely the
same, and because in the present studyâ€™s data only 244
journals had at least 50 signed articles with an explicit
publication type; there would be even fewer journals with at
least 50 research articles.
