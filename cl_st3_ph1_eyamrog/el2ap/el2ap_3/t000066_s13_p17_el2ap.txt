The first activity was called Find someone who. It aimed
at having participants find out who the guests were and
also introduce themselves by asking questions to get to know
one another. The objective of this activity was to highlight
that using language is more than finding specific information. It
allows us to start a conversation with a stranger, establish
some kind of connection − by means of eye contact
and facial expressions − and learn to select words that
help us get to know people better, and thus feel
more comfortable near them. To that end, facilitators divided participants
in three breakout rooms and provided them with a table
of the job titles, cities, and countries of the guests
(see Figure 2). After receiving this information, the participants improvised
questions to try and guess who was in their breakout
room before the time set for that activity was up.
