The genera with most species were: Evandromyia (18), Psychodopygus (18),
Psathyromyia (17), Lutzomyia (10), Nyssomyia (9), Trichophoromyia (9), Micropygomyia (9),
Pintomyia (6), Pressatia (4), Sciopemyia (4), Bichromomyia (3), Brumptomyia (3),
Trichopygomyia (2), Viannamyia (2), Migonemyia (1). Noteworthy, is that 12
observations were reported as Trichophoromyia sp. as the record shows
the number of specimens and distribution together for two species
Trichophoromyia auraensis and Trichophoromyia ruifreitasi as their females cannot be
distinguished by morphology.
