Corinnidae was represented by 84 individuals, 32 (38.1%) of these
colleted in DA and 20 individuals (23.8%) collected in IA
and FA, the ANOVA test not obtained difference (F-value =
0,98; P-value = 0,428). Both in the cold and dry
period as in the hot and rainy period, the Corinnidae
were more collected in DA and IA (figure 6 b),
according to the ANOVA test (F-value = 0,208; P-value =
0,818) and in the post-hoc, the family has a normal
distribution in the treatments. Only FA in cold and dry
period, a family showing a significant difference (W-test = 0,7500;
P-value = 0,00000000000000002), but this difference was not recovered in
the Kruskal-Wallis test and in the Dunnâ€™s post-hoc equipped for
the Bonferroni method.
