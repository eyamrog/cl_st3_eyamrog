Carbohydrates, on the other hand, are associated with the seed's
capacity to withstand desiccation and storage at negative temperatures, among
other structural and biochemical characteristics. For Mollo et al. (2011),
the carbohydrates present in the seeds of Alcantarea imperialis (Carrière)
Harms (Bromeliaceae), trigger mechanisms of adaptation to the cold, when
seeds were submitted to low temperatures in growth chambers (5
± 2 °C, 15 ± 2 °C, 15 °C dark
/ 30 °C light and 30 ± 2 °C, photoperiod
12-h). According to these authors, the sucrose contents in plants,
at cold conditions, can be exchanged for trehalose, raffinose, and
stachyose. Moreover, the starch concentrations changed with the presence of
cold, possibly reduced to carbohydrates associated with the plant's tolerance
and protection from cold (Mollo et al. 2011). Hence, it
can be inferred that a longer permanence of the fruits
connected to the mother plant, after anthesis, represents a greater
accumulation of carbohydrates, since, according to the results of the
present study, the higher the DAA for the fruit collection,
the greater will be the loss of water in the
seeds.
