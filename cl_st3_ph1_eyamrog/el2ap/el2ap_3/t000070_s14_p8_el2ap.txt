Sections (5 μm) were obtained using a hand-rotating microtome (Leica
RM 2135) with tungsten razors. The sections were placed on
slides and stained with Toluidine Blue (TBO) to identify acid
polysaccharides and Lugol for starch identification. The sections were analysed
under an optical microscope (Olympus BX40) and photographed with an
image capture system (Olympus Q-Color- 3C América Ind.).
