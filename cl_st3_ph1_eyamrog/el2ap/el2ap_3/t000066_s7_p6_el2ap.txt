Considering this scenario, two Brazilian Higher Education professors, members of
the LACE Research Group, joined the GPB as Brigadiers, and
decided to offer a workshop in which their college students
could practice some English language skills and talk to professionals
in other countries. These participants were also invited to discover
what they could do towards global collaboration, being mindful of
the crisis everyone was going through simultaneously, though feeling it
differently, at that moment. The workshop was held in July,
gathering around fifteen participants on ZOOM, who shared their personal
and professional experiences while playing and talking for an hour.
