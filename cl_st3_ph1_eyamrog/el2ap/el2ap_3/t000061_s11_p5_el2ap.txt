For Adorno and Horkheimer (1985), the need for self-preservation of
life is at the archaic origin of mimetic behavior. In
addition, the use of mimesis worked, in the early days,
as a way to allay the fear of the different,
unknown, frightening and threatening: by imitating or acting, the subject
erased (diminished) the difference with what caused him fear. The
resort to mythology, magical rituals, dances, among others, served as
a way to assimilate the unknown, which became less frightening
when appropriated by different forms of language (Gagnebin, 1993).
