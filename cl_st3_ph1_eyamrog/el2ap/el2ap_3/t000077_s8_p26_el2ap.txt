Among the research focused on tele-workability in Brazil, we highlight
the reports developed by investigators from the Institute of Applied
Economic Research (IPEA). Using data from May to November of
2020, Góes et al. (2021) found that the “remote workforce”
was predominantly composed of formal-sector workers with complete college education,
aged between 30 and 39 years, women, and white people.
These results are sensitive to the size of each group
in the workforce.
