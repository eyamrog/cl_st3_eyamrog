Theridiidae was represented by 37 individuals, 16 (43%) of these
collected in the DA, 13 (35%) collected in the IA
and 8 (22%) collected in the FA. The DA showed
a significant difference in the Shapiro - Wilk test (W-test
= 0,7500; P-value = 0,000000000000000022), but this significant difference was
not recovered in the Kruskal-Wallis test and in the Dunnâ€™s
post-hoc, adjusted for the Bonferroni method. When compared to the
time of year, the heat and humidity period did not
show significant differences, but in the cold and dry period,
DA and IA had no differences in the data and
FA individuals were not collected from the family.
