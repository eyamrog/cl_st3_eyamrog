Although not much progress has been made in a general
sense in complying with the agreements of that convention, the
issue remains open and is reviewed periodically, due to the
importance it has for the world and in particular for
developing countries. It is precisely in these countries where the
highest level of biodiversity exists, and also where it is
most threatened. Latin America and the Caribbean stand out for
their exceptional natural wealth, when compared to other regions of
the planet, and also for the danger of erosion of
these resources (León and Cárdenas, 2020).
