Whenever people talk there are very likely to be questions
and answers. These utterances are realized at different points in
"sequence time." Notwithstanding the content of their questions, questioners are
oriented to what lies just ahead, and depend on what
is to come; answerers are oriented to what has just
been said, and look backward, not forward. Observe that although
a question anticipates an answer, is designed to receive it,
seems dependent on doing so, an answer seems even more
dependent, making less sense alone than does the utterance that
called it forth. Whatever answers do, they must do this
with something already begun.
