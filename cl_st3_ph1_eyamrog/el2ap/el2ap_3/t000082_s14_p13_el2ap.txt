Some species do not provide benefit for any of their
interaction partners, relying exclusively upon cheating interactions (Bronstein 2001). We
hypothesize that exclusive cheaters species could amplify the effects of
cheating interactions, i.e., leading to effects on trait distributions that
are higher than observed in simulations with the same number
of cheating interactions in the network but randomly distributed across
all ecological interactions (see previous set of simulations). We expected
that this effect would be even stronger if the exclusive
cheaters species are highly connected or perform central roles in
the network structure. To explore the role of these exclusive,
highly connected cheaters species in affecting the coevolutionary outcome, we
selected the most connected species of the network and assumed
these species are only involved in cheating interactions. To do
so, we calculate the degree centrality (Newman 2018), which is
a standardized measure of the number of interactions of a
given species on the mutualistic network. The weighted degree centrality
Ci for a species i from a given set (e.g.,
floral visitors) is: <>, in which ùëòùëñ is the number
of interactions of species i and No is the species
richness from the opposite set of i (e.g., if species
i is a floral visitor, the opposite set is formed
by flowering plants). We computed a z-score to detect extreme
values of species centrality and identify the most central species,
<> where ùê∂ÃÖ is the average value of degree centrality
of the network and ùúé is the standard deviation of
the degree centrality values. To test the effect of central
cheaters species on trait evolution, we set all species with
Si>1 as exclusive cheaters. Thus, we will have a network
with central species as obligate cheaters - our Central scenario.
