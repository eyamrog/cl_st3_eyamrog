an adjacency pair is a sequence of two utterances which
are adjacent, produced by different speakers, ordered as a first
part and second part and typed, so that a first
part requires a particular second, or range of second parts
(Heritage, 1984a, p. 246). An invitation, then, would be the
first part of an invitation –response pair, a question the
first part of a question – answer pair, and a
greeting the first part of a greeting–greeting pair.
