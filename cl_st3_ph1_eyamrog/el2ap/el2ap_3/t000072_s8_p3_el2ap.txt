The seed bank may present changes in its composition because
it is formed by both seeds from the fragment individuals
themselves and by dispersers from other areas (Bossuyht & Honnay
2008). The seed bank is a stock of viable, non-germinated
seeds, present in the ground, and can germinate within a
short time, or remain in a state of latency until
optimal conditions arise for germination (Martins 2009).
