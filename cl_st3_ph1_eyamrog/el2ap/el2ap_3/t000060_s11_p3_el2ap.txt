The simple occurrence of a turn3 does not constitute a
conversation; actually, we believe that not even two turns constitute
a conversation either. There must be more than two coordinated
and cooperative turns, which are involved in conditions of relevance
(conditional relevance). Given the first part of the turn, a
second is expectable, and if it occurs, it is regarded
as a second in relation to the first. In these
terms, the sequence of the first part coupled with the
second constitutes a conversational pair, which is considered, in fact,
the minimal dialogic unit.
