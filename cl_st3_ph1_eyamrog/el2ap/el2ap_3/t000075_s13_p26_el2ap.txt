An important research topic that stands out in the new
literature on capital controls is the comparison, under several methodologies,
of the effectiveness of capital controls imposed by emerging and
developing economies vis-Ã -vis financial regulatory measures imposed by developed countries.
These last measures are characterized by prudential measures that affect,
even indirectly, outflow investments from domestic agents. Several studies point
out that prudential measures imposed by developed countries on its
capital outflows are more effective at countering cross-border fluxes compared
to inflow controls imposed by emerging economies. This new evidence,
summarized below, is very important due to the debate about
the multilateral aspects of capital controls and to the need
for international coordination between capital recipient and capital source countries.
