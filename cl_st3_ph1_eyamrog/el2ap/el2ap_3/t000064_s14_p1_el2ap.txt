Plant material and treatments - The control group was five
individuals of Vellozia squamata naturally found at Parque Ecológico Burle
Max, Brasília, DF, Brazil, selected in a convenience sample due
to easy access and apparently healthy vigor. For details of
climate and soil, consult Bucci et al. (2006). Voucher specimens
were deposited at the herbarium UB under the numbers UB0028356
and UB0028358. Seeds were harvested, put to germinate and the
plantlets were sectioned and submitted to the protocol of micropropagation
of Neto (2009). The hallmarks of this protocol for the
present study area: a) plantlets in culture medium (Murashige-Skoog medium
added with sucrose and phytoregulators kinetin, indol-butyric acid and gibberellin);
b) seedlings under acclimatization in a greenhouse in pots containing
soil; c) cultivation outside, in garden conditions. Thus, the following
experimental treatments were: a) plantlets in culture medium growing under
photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) of 32 µmol m-2 s-1, photoperiod
of 12/12 h and controlled temperature of 27 ± 2
°C; b) rooted seedlings in condition of a greenhouse, under
partial shade, with maximal PAR of 412 µmol m-2 s-1,
as measured by a portable refractometer Apogee Instruments®; c) plants
obtained by micropropagation and cultivated in an external garden, in
treated and fertilized soil, exposed to the natural environmental conditions
of Cerrado (annual cycle of drought and rains). The wild
plants were the control.
