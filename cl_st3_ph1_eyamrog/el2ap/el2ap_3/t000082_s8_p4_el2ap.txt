We are beginning to understand how cheaters interactions could drive
evolutionary patterns in mutualisms, as species acting as a cheater
or mutualist may affect coevolution and local adaptation. For example,
the interaction between the plant Lithophragma parviflorum (Saxifragaceae) and the
floral-parasitic moth Greya politella changes from parasitism to mutualism if
the legitimate pollinators of L. parviflorum are absent in the
community (Thompson & Cunningham 2002). A fundamental challenge to study
evolutionary consequences of ecological interactions at the community level is
that pairwise interactions affect each other within ecological networks. A
cheating interaction happen with a negative effect on one partner
and positive effect on the other one. In this context,
evolutionary changes can cascade via indirect effects (Guimarães et al.
2017), affecting how species traits evolve and ultimately shaping how
species interact in the community. As a consequence of the
non-random patterns of interaction networks, central species play an important
role in maintaining the structure of networks and, consequently, increasing
the stability of selection pressures between species in the network
(Martín Gonzáles et al. 2010). However, we still do not
understand how central cheaters affect mutualistic coevolutionary dynamics.
