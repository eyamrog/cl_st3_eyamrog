Drawing on the CoI model, the purpose of this embedded
correlational study is threefold: a) discover what types of emojis
are used to support cognitive, teaching, and social presences in
an 8-week continuing education course on the use of mobile
devices and application via WhatsApp; b) determine how participants’ attitudes
relate to the use of emojis for cognitive, teaching, and
social presences during this course; and c) determine how participants’
age and gender relate to and potentially explain their emoji
use. With this purpose in mind, this paper presents a
brief overview of the Community of Inquiry (CoI) Model.
