This device makes her version weaker because of the inconsistent
way she describes the time of actions. She says that
it was after two o’clock when she was putting the
luggage in the car, and when Martinez asks her again:
“And it was surely after two you... did what you
were doing?”, she is totally vague. We can observe her
hesitation by the use of the verbal planning markers Uh
and well, accompanied by pauses and discourse markers which show
uncertainty: maybe maybe not, I guess, and I don’t know.
On the other hand, it is interesting to see that
the prosecutor’s wording is vague as well: is “did what
you were doing” having sex or putting the luggage in
the car?. When questions are not clear, answers also tend
to be unclear, and consequently this can make listeners confused
because of the impreciseness of the utterances.
