Regarding empirical research, there is no well-established empirical strategy of
SBD identification. Initially, the studies used prior regional knowledge as
identification, but the results did not fit the data, as
McMillen (2001b) pointed out. More objective procedures can be divided
into 1) Cut-off values: researchers impose some cut-off point on
the density of jobs and the total number of jobs
(McDonald, 1987; Giuliano and Small, 1991; McDonald and McMillen, 1998;
Coffey and Shearmur, 2001; Baumont and Bourdon, 2002; López and
Muñiz, 2005); 2) Econometric models (Craig and Ng, 2001; McMillen,
2001a, 2001b; McMillen and Smith, 2003); 3) Spatial statistics (Plaut
and Plaut, 1998; Baumont et al., 2004; Herman and Haddad,
2005; Guillain et al., 2003, and Siqueira, 2014).
