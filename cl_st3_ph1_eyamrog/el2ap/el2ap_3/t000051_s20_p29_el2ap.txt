In this section, I have analysed the speech thematically, identifying
a range of manifest and latent discourses. I have used
a range of appraisal strategies to show how Scholz expands

connects these discourses to position himself and justify his future
policies. In the following section, I will provide an overview
and an interpretation of the interplay of the discourses from
a dialogic perspective on centripetal and centrifugal discourses.
