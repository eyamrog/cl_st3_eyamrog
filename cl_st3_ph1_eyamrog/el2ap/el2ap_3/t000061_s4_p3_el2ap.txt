Thus, the best path seems to be a balanced training
between mimetic stimuli and the development of theoretical reasoning, as
the excess of the discursive transmission route through lectures is
pointed out, even by the questionnaire respondents, as insufficient to
enable training proper. Finally, it is understood that the relationship
established between researcher and beginner in USR has characteristics that
foster a mimetic relationship between them and, to that extent,
can function as a powerful instance of moral training in
research, efficient and legitimate, as it is produced a on
the research practice in the respective area, more authentic than
the simple recourse to external standardization.
