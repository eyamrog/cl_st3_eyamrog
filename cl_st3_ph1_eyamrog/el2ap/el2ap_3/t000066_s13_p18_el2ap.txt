When participants came back to the general room, they talked
about who the guests they had met were and provided
further information they found out. During this part of the
workshop the facilitators also asked some guests to share their
answer to the question: Global collaboration: what can young professionals
do? so that they could broaden the discussion of ways
to create reality through multiple forms of saying, feeling, acting,
and being in the world.
