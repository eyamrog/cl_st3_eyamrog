Khamis et al. (2021) used high-frequency phone surveys to assess
the early impacts of Covid-19 on the labor market in
various developing countries. They found that 34% of respondents reported
stopping work, with differences across regions: 21% in the East
Asia and Pacific, 29% in Europe and Central Asia, 48%
in the Latin America and the Caribbean region (LAC), 45%
in the Middle East and North Africa region and 26%
in the Sub-Saharan Africa region; within the LAC, 30% stopped
working in Chile and 36% in Costa Rica, while 59%
stopped working in Peru and 69% in Bolivia. They show
that workers were more likely to stop working in services
(38%) and industry (40%) than in agriculture (22%).
