Participants from different professional areas and backgrounds got together to
play and talk about their lives during the crisis and
their desire for better days. The sequence of activities in
the workshop challenged participants, who were studying English in college,
to use such language in a critical perspective. That means
to understand real life situations and share their points of
view based on their own and other peopleâ€™s experiences. The
English language was one of the resources in this multimodal
context, in which facial expressions, laugh, gestures, sounds, and written
texts were all used to establish a connection among participants.
