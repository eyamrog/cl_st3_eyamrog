The largest number of pioneer individuals cataloged was in plots
R, that is, the largest seed bank in this ecological
group was cataloged at the edge of the fragment, which
borders the Mogi Gua√ßu River. Forest areas adjacent to the
watercourse have greater stratification of vegetation, allowing direct light to
enter the area (Wallace et al. 2018), providing subsidy for
the germination of species of this ecological group (Pereira et
al. 2010; Correia & Martins 2015), which justifies the data
obtained here. On the contrary, in plots I (farthest from
the river), most non-pioneer species were cataloged. This can be
explained by the fact that the areas furthest from the
edge generally have a more homogeneous canopy, providing shade and
humidity (Wallace et al. 2018), creating an optimal condition for
such species to develop.
