Invasive alien species are those that, once introduced from other
environments, adapt, start to reproduce and intensely proliferate. This can
cause changes in ecological processes and harm native species. These
biological invasions are the second biggest cause of biodiversity loss
in the world (Mack et al. 2000, Latini et al.
2016). According to the Pombo et al. (2016) biological invasions
produce changes and alterations in the ecological properties of the
soil, in nutrient cycling, in water availability, in the trophic
chains, the dynamic structure and distribution of populations and communities.
Besides that, invasive alien species alter ecosystem functions, through changes
in biomass distribution and decomposition rates (Helsen et al. 2018).
Invasive alien species also interfere with evolutionary processes, with the
local extinction of species and homogenization of ecosystems (Herrera et
al. 2016).
