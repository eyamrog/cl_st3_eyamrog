The use of prudential capital controls would then induce domestic
agents to internalize their indebtedness decisions, and therefore avoid a
financial amplification process. Additionally, prudential capital controls can promote the
intertemporal smoothing of consumption and raise economic growth, thus confronting
the orthodoxy until in force (Korinek, 2011). Following a similar
line of reasoning, Ostry et al. (2012) argue that the
capital influx controls, when focusing on such externality, aim to
reduce this component of the consumption function of the representative
agent, and therefore to promote an intertemporal smoothing in consumption.
