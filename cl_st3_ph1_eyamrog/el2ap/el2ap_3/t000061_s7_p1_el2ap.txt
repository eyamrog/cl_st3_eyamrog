Research ethics is a sensitive field, as it was at
the center of serious ethical violations that occurred throughout human
history, especially during World War II. The proliferation of norms
declared aimed at protecting the moral field is a phenomenon
that has been growing at an accelerated pace in recent
years, especially in educational institutions, where it would be reasonable
to have a preferentially formative answer to the question of
research ethics. As a response to these violations, an intense
normative movement began to regulate research, initially aimed at preventing
the repetition of transgressions mostly practiced in the biomedical sciences,
but which was spreading to other fields of research, most
of the time without due respect to the particularities of
the scientific areas that have come to be regulated (Israel
and Hay, 2006).
