Furthermore, leaves from in vitro plants of V. squamata presented
several structural differences in comparison with plants in acclimatization: they
had no subepidermal fibres, subtler dorsiventral mesophyll, undifferentiated bundle sheath
extension, fewer vascular system fibres, as well as a lack
of aquiferous parenchyma. The aquiferous tissue remains in the leaves
from pineapple (Ananas comosus L.) grown in vitro (Barboza et
al. 2006), so qualitative alterations like those observed in V.
squamata are no ordinary thing, mainly the absence of stomatal
crypts and subepidermal fibres.
