The various online activities, accessing websites, messenger apps, using social
media, and Internet gaming, have become part of most people's
daily lives, especially among adolescents and young adults (Lin et
al., 2017; McLean et al., 2019). Given the emergence of
social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tik Tok,
Snapchat, and others, there has been an increase in the
number of studies investigating problematic social media use, dependence on
this behavior, and its impact on people's lives (Alimoradi et
al., 2019; Montag et al. 2015, 2017). However, assessing aspects
of well-being and self-esteem in the face of social media
use is rarely discussed in the literature, such as the
behavior of taking selfies and sharing them on social media,
especially among adolescents.
