Capturing the culicids was carried out in nature reserves in
18 municipalities (Figure 1) in the state of Paraná between
1967 and 1999. The Dense Ombrophilous Forest phytogeographic region is
represented in the collection as the area that contains the
majority of samples (n= 4,831) with the municipality of Morretes
having 4,774 (98%) recorded samples. In fact, this region has
been used as a collection place for culicids by different
researchers, bearing in mind the availability of conservation areas in
the region. [1–4]. Throughout the 30 years of study, identifications
were carried out and confirmed by taxonomists in the group,
including Dr. Ana Lozovei, as well such collaborators as Dr.
Samira Chahad-Ehlers, Dr. Luiz Gonzaga dos Santos-Neto and Dr. Adson
Luís Sant’Ana, who are three of the co-authors of this
article. Some identifications were confirmed at the time by Dr.
Maria Anice Mureb Sallum of the Public Health Faculty of
the University of São Paulo. The Parasitology Collection of the
Basic Pathology Department is part of the Information System on
Brazilian Diversity (SiBBr) and can be accessed on https://collectory.sibbr.gov.br/collectory/public/show/co446.
