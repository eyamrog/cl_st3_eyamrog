For college students and young professionals taking part in the
workshop, that moment of conversation affected them somehow because they
could relate to their own ups and downs while studying
online, how the job market was dealing with the crisis
in their area, and also how they were personally dealing
with all those demands. Such reactions bring to mind the
concept of affectus, in a spinozian perspective, that is, affectus
is responsible for the transformation of the self through composing
“joyful encounters with bodies” (Spinoza, 2003). Excerpts 2 and 3
are part of two other testimonials that show further how
much participants felt at ease to share experiences during the
workshop.
