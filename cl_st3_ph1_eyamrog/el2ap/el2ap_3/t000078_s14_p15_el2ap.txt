Embraesp database provides information on the size of the property
(floor area and total area), the number of bedrooms, bathrooms,
parking lot spaces, elevators, apartment units per floor, building floors,
and a dummy distinguishing between an apartment or house typologies).
Other information is not considered, such as the composition of
the condominium (swimming pools, playground, courts, etc.). To overcome such
a lack of information, we used the difference between the
total area and the useful floor area as a proxy
for the condominium size per apartment.
