Since being introduced to the market in 2009, WhatsAppâ€™s popularity
has continued to grow. If in its infancy the app
was primarily used for communication, it has proved to be
a tool that can be used to mediate educational experiences.
The ubiquitous and mobile nature of the app, coupled with
its features for creating and sharing oral, written and multimedia
content, replying and forwarding posts has piqued the interest of
teachers, especially in the language context, to integrate this tool
into teaching and learning.
