All approaches that use gross employment density (employment/area) are sensitive
to the areaâ€™s size. More extensive regions tend to have
smaller densities (and vice versa), confounding the identification of subcenters.
Besides, Mieszkowski and Smith (1991) point out that the coefficients
estimated by gross density tend to overestimate the estimated coefficients.
