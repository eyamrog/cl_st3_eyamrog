Crowley and Doran (2020) performed a similar analysis for Ireland.
They found that there is a wide variation of social
distancing and remote working potential across occupations and within industries
and that chances of remote work favor workers located in
more affluent, larger, more densely populated cities, with better education
and better broadband supply.
