The chlorophyll content was slightly greater in the plants growing
in the greenhouse than in vitro, but significantly inferior to
those in the garden (table 1). This content was greater
in the garden plants than the greenhouse ones, but inferior
to the wild plants, and the leaves presented a tonality
of a lighter green, but not suggesting chlorosis, since the
color intensity was uniform (figure 5). Leaf anatomy - The
anatomical analysis showed the effects of environmental and growth conditions
on the structure of V. squamata leaves (figure 6). In
all leaves, the epidermis was single layered and without trichomes.
In leaves of field grown plants (control group) and of
garden condition (figures 6 a, f), the abaxial surface was
smooth and the adaxial was corrugated. On the other hand,
there was no visible epidermal ornamentation in leaves of in
vitro grown plantlets nor of greenhouse acclimatizing plants (figures 6
d, e).
