This analysis is implemented by estimating Probit models of remote
work, the results of which, expressed in marginal effects for
conditional probabilities, are shown in Table 3. In column (1)
the model was estimated without controls for the federation units,
for the months and for the 36 categories of labor
activities; from column (2) to (4), fixed effects for these
variables are added sequentially, with the model in the column
(4) controlling all those fixed effects. Probit estimates are shown
in Table A2.
