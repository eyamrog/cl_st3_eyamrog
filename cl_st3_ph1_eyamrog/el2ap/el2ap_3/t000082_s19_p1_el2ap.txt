The higher the proportion of cheating interactions, the higher the
trait disparity observed across animal species and across plant species
in the network (Fig. 2a-c). The effect of cheating interactions
is similar for the three types of networks studied here,
leading to increased trait disparity (Table 2). Thus, cheating interactions
increase the trait disparity across species (Fig. 2), and this
effect is not dependent on the structure of the ecological
network. Following our results, we develop an analytical approximation which
relates the importance of evolutive effects and the trait disparity
of species. Both simulations and analytical approximation points to an
increase in trait disparity due to cheating interactions (Supporting Information).
