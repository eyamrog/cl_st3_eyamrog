Considering that more and more adolescents and young adults engage
in the behavior of taking selfies, Balakrishnan and Griffiths (2017)
developed the Selfitis Behavior Scale (SBS), whose psychometric tests to
assess the reliability and validity of the scale (exploratory factor
analysis and internal consistency) were satisfactory when assessed in a
sample of Indian university students, as well as in a
sample of university students from Iran and Afghanistan (Lin et
al., 2019), a sample of Turkish university students (Ciplak &
Atici, 2021), and in a sample of Italian university students
(Monacis et al., 2020).
