The covariance between the Gini coefficient and the proportion of
articles by the most prolific author depended on the number
of articles (panel C in Figure 1), as expected from
the relationship between each index and the number of articles.
Journals with more articles had a low proportion, independently of
the Gini coefficient, while journals with fewer articles had larger
proportions if they had larger Gini coefficients.
