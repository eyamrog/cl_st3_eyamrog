Identification. This species is easily distinguishable by persistent membranous exoperidium
in old specimens, endoperidium with a velvety texture and abundant
mycosclereids well visible to the stereoscope on its surface, a
mamiform and fimbriated mouth, and by the globose basidiospores with
ridges which offer a characteristic cross-linked to sub-crosslinked morphology (Campi
et al. 2016a).
