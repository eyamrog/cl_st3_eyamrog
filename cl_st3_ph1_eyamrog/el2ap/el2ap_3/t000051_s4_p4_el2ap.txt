The historically documented Russian position (see Section 4) is here
represented by the indivisible security discourse, which is centrifugal. As
I argue above, its marginalisation supports the Putinâ€™s war discourse
by making it seem as if the concept of indivisible
security were a fabulation only entertained by Putin, a position
that is supported by the ubiquitous watershed discourse, which argues
that Putin will be a security threat for the foreseeable
future, thus invalidating potentially competing discourses of indivisable security and
those demanding diplomacy. Where he does engage with alternative voices,
those represent a tougher stance than his own, for instance
those demanding a rupture of dialogue with Russia and those
arguing that freedom, tolerance and human rights do not generally
exist there.
