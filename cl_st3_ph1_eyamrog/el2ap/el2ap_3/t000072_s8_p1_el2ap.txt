When the vegetation is located close to watercourses, it is
renamed as riparian forest, defined as a transition area, extending
between the limit of watercourses to the edge of higher
lands, being strongly influenced by the water regimen, in addition
to presenting high heterogeneity of habitats (Naiman et al. 2005).
