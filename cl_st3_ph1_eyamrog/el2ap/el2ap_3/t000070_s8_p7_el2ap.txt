According to Mollo et al. (2011), in Alcantarea imperialis (Carri√®re)
Harms (Bromeliaceae), carbohydrates undergo appreciable changes, in adaptations to the
cold. The authors describe that the sucrose contents of plants
under cold conditions can be exchanged for trehalose, raffinose, and
stachyose. They also report that starch concentrations changed with the
presence of cold, possibly reduced to carbohydrates associated with tolerance
and protection of the plant to cold.
