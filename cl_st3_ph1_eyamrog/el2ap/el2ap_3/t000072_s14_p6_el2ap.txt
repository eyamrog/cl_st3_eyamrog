The sampling method in the 10 plots was adapted from
Braga et al. (2016), consisting of the collection of four
samples per splot, with the aid of a 25 cm
x 25 cm template. The samples were collected in September
2018 during the transition from the dry season to the
rainy, since it is the period in which it is
possible to sample greater diversity of species from the seed
bank analysis (Braga et al. 2016).
