However, in this article, the aim is to affirm the
importance of USR for mimetic learning in the moral field,
which applies equally to science in general, with no difference
between biological, SSH or mathematical sciences. If the correct way
to hold a pair of scissors may require a theoretical
explanation that is too abstract for a trainee, what then
about understanding the metaphysical concepts that characterize moral thinking, and,
even more challenging, the application of those concepts to research
practice? However, in USR, it is possible for the student
to visualize the application of the concepts of the moral
field by experienced researchers, for example, in the adoption of
ethical care in conducting a research.
