In Excerpt 8, another objection is raised by Mr. Martinez.
He claims again that the defendant’s answer is not responsive
to the question “What is it that you’re learning?”. However,
in this case, we do not observe any preservation property
in Ms. Willmott’s second version of the question, but rather
deletion and transformation characteristics: “What was Mr. Alexander’s description of
premarital, LDS of you want premarital sex”. The message in
the original question is totally deleted and transformed into a
new one, so much more specific. After several unsuccessful previous
attempts against prosecutor’s objections, Ms. Willmott chooses to restate her
question quite directly (yes/no question), thus preventing the defendant’s answer
from a new objection.
