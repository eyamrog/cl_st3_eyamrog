abstract concepts with observable and measurable indicators of the construct
being assessed (Wynd et al., 2003). It also assesses the
degree to which each scale item is relevant and representative

evaluated through factor analysis and also by the expert committee
which, in this study, was composed of the authors of
the study, in similarity to the study of Toledo Junior
et al., 2018).
