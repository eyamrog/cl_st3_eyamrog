Given the new evidence on the effectiveness of capital controls,
several economists aimed to identify the classes of capital flows
for which the use of CFMs would be theoretical desirable.
In the research in this field, Blanchard et al.â€™s (2017)
study stands out due to the theoretical innovation on conventional
open economy models. The authors distinguish between capital flows destined
for emerging economies in terms of bonds and non-bonds, in
which the first class encompasses debt bonds and the second
one encompasses mainly equity instruments and FDIs, as a method
to identify whether capital flows are expansionist or contractionary. According
to the authors, debts bonds are contractionary, following the IS-LM-BP
models, because this kind of capital flows appreciate the exchange
rate and do not contribute to an expansion of internal
credit backed in a foreign currency. On the other hand,
non-bond flows can be expansionist or contractionary depending on its
net effect on economic activity. This is because non-bond flows
provoke exchange rate appreciation and an expansion of internal credit
backed in a foreign currency. If the latter effect prevails
over the former, then non-bond flows will be expansionist. Consequently,
the use of capital controls on bond inflows is always
desirable, and the use of capital controls on non-bond inflows
will be desirable only if the net effect of these
inflows is contractionary (Blanchard et al., 2017).
