Scholz’s comments on foreign policy can be read as a
turn away from Merkel’s pragmatic policy, which was characterised by
“strong commitment to the Minsk negotiations, as well as to
the so-called Normandy Format, and Chancellor Merkel’s frequent meetings with
Russian President Vladimir Putin” (RÁCZ, 2022, p.3) to maintain dialogue
with Russia. The new coalition government is expected to take
a tougher course in line with US expectations, considering Merkel’s
policy “naive” and akin to the “appeasement” politics in 1938
(RIPSMAN & LEVY, 2008; LATHAM, 2021).
