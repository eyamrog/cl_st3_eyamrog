In turn, the choice of USR6, as the initial phase
of the researcher's profession, was due to the fact that,
although undergraduate students carry out research throughout the course, USR
is the most significant instance of training in scientific research,
as it is properly guided and systematically organized by a
more experienced researcher and by experimenting in a real research
environment. This statement is supported by the regulatory legislation of
the Institutional Program for Scientific Initiation Scholarships (PIBIC), the oldest
public policy to encourage USR still in force in Brazil
and which serves as a base for the other types
of USR. Pursuant to Normative Resolution No. 017/2006 of the
National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), the USR
aims to “awaken a scientific vocation and encourage potential talent
among university graduate students, through participation in a research project,
guided by a qualified researcher” (Brazil, 2006).
