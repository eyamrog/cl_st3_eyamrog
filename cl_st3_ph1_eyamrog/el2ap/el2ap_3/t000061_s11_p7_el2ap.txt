Like Plato, even criticizing mimetic behavior, Frankfurtian authors argue around
the strong human inclination to its practice; more than that,
Adorno recognizes the existence of an “unavoidable moment of mimesis
that is intrinsic to all human knowledge and practice” (Adorno,
2009: 131). Given the inevitability of this moment, Adorno (2009)
argues that the rational emancipation intended by the Enlightenment movement
should, precisely, be built from the overcoming of this first
and inherent mimetic contact with reality. For Adorno and Horkheimer
(1985), strongly influenced by Freud (1996), the absence of the
rational overcoming of the first mimesis would result in the
risk of adopting regressive behaviors, among which the most serious
would be the realization of a “deeply rooted tendency in
the living being and whose overcoming is a sign of
evolution: the tendency to lose oneself instead of actively imposing
itself on the environment, the propensity to let go, to
regress to nature” (Adorno and Horkheimer, 1985: 187).
