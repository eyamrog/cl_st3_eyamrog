The ever-increasing food needs of the population and the animal
species bred in captivity for human consumption are leading to
the use of alternative sources of nutrients for these purposes.
One of the variants coming to be exploited is the
use of flour obtained from insects. The larvae of the
black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens L.), a species native to
America and now widespread throughout the world, can be converted
into flour with a high protein content, useful in feeding
fish (Meitiyani et al. 2020) and birds (Wahid et al.
2021).
