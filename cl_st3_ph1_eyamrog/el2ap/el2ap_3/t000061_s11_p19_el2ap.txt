Following this line, Benjamin (1985) states that art is the
privileged dimension for the occurrence of true experiences. The artist
is the one who retains the ability to produce similarities
non- sensible, to see similarities where no one sees them.
This idea is at the center of Aesthetic Theory Adorno's,
apparently due to the influence of his dialogue with Benjamin
(Gagnebin, 1993). Despite the risks pointed out by Adorno, it
is clear from the Negative Dialectics and, even more, from
the Aesthetic Theory, that the author does not condemn mimetic
behavior; however, he understands that a first and desirable moment
of mimetic approach to reality must be accompanied by the
rational exercise of the subject: “it is neither an immediate
mimesis, nor repressed mimesis, but the process it triggers and
in the which remains modified” (Adorno, 1982: 364).
