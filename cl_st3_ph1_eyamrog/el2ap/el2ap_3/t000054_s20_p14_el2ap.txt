The concession provoked numerous complaints from indigenous communities and an
international lawsuit led by the Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of
the Amazon Basin (COICA). After long years of legal battle,
the patent was withdrawn in 1999, but not as a
direct consequence of the claims of the native peoples, but
on the basis that a specimen of the plant had
already rested in the Chicago Museum since before the request.
Surprisingly, in 2001 Miller presented new documents and obtained the
restitution of the patent until its expiration in 2003, although
without rights beyond the genome of the plant and its
asexual propagules (Beyer 2008).
