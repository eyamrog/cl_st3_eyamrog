Bridi (2020) concluded that job losses in Brazil in the
second quarter of 2020 were significantly higher for informal workers;
whether in comparison between salaried employees with and without a
formal contract, or between entrepreneurs with or without CNPJ. Corseuil
et al. (2021) also found that a relevant aspect of
the current crisis was its magnified impact on informal occupation.
Their studies showed that more vulnerable groups of workers tend
to be over-represented in informality, which cause important negative effects
on equity. Al Masri et al. (2021) found that the
greatest reductions in employment occurred for informal, self-employed and younger
workers in the second and third quarters of 2020; that
the outflow of the workforce for men decreased as early
as in the third quarter, while for women this outflow
continued to increase; and that industries that are more contact
intensive have experienced the largest job losses. None of this
research specifically accessed remote work and its determinants.
