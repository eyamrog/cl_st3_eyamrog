The year 2020 dramatically changed the history of humankind. This
fact not only refers to the impact of the coronavirus
all over the world, but also turns the spotlight onto
some open wounds caused by social inequality, which we have
not yet been able to heal. This worldwide crisis made
us face that what we have accomplished so far might
not keep us away from so many kinds of threats
to our existence. The only hope is to fight against
opposing forces, such as racism, exploitation, violence, prejudice, and the
like. We urgently need to stand up for the planet
we live in and (re)think the ways we lead our
lives as residents (Krenak, 2020).
