We explored the coevolutionary outcomes of cheating interactions in mutualistic
networks. Our results show how trait evolution and network structure
could change due to cheating lifestyles that emerge in mutualisms.
Previous studies already explored the effect of mutualisms and cheating
interactions on population dynamics (Law et al. 2001, Bronstein et
al. 2003, Wilson et al. 2003, Lee 2015) and phenotypic
evolution (Ferriere et al. 2002). In this context, our work
contributes to further our understanding on coevolutionary dynamics of multispecies
assemblages in three different ways.
