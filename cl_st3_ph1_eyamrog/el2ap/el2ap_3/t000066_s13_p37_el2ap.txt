The activities described above exemplify how GPBâ€™s participants integrate play
to a revolutionary cause aligned with the idea of a
moving world in which they, when being affected and affecting
others, can dialectically and collaboratively increase their powers of action
(conatus) and develop agency. Motivated by mutual support and a
more equitable perspective towards society, an activist agency can be
created. According to Stetsenko (2017), confronting the inequality crisis by
expanding what is predicted in the status quo, can guide
people towards co-creating history, and society simultaneously to their own
transforming agencies.
