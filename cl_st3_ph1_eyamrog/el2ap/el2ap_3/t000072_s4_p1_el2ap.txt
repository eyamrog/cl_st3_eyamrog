Through this study we can see that at a distance
of about 30 meters from the watercourse, there is no
significant difference between species diversity. The only factor that separates
the border and interior region is the number of individuals
and ecological group. There is also an ecological balance between
fauna and flora, since most of the cataloged species are
dispersed by animals. Therefore, the conservation of natural fragments is
important both for the maintenance of plant and animal species,
and for obtaining propagules intended for the recovery of degraded
areas. From the analysis of the seed bank in the
study area, it is possible to recognize the potential of
the fragment in question to supply propagules or even litter
transposition for ecological restoration, given the recognized floristic diversity.
