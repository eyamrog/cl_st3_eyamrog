The decision to offer such workshop was made in July,
2020, at the end of a difficult semester in which
their students in areas such as Logistics, Human Resources, Commercial
Management, Systems Analysis, and Business had not yet understood all
the huge changes in their courses routines, let alone the
uncertainty of the job market. Thus, the objective of the
workshop was to help participants share their fears regarding speaking
English online to a stranger as well as finding out
what people were doing worldwide to deal with the crisis.
Hopefully, this would help participants critically understand different views, take
a stance and collaborate in whatever way they could.
