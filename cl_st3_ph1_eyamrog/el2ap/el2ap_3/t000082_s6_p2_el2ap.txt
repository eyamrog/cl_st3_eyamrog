First, cheating interactions promote higher community-level trait disparity in mutualistic
networks. By imposing selection favoring trait mismatching, the presence of
cheating interactions leads to an increase in species trait disparity.
This arms race dynamics partially offsets selection favoring convergence and
trait matching in mutualisms (Guimar√£es et al. 2011, Zhang et
al. 2012). Therefore, cheating interactions may allow us to understand
one of the mechanisms preventing the perfect trait matching in
empirical mutualistic communities (Law et al. 2001); yet trait disparity
cannot increase indefinitely due to factors related to the environmental
pressures and distinct selection regimes (Andreazzi et al. 2017). For
instance, limited genetic variation or limited anatomical and physiological mechanisms
restricts fruit sugar content and flower size (Jordano 1995), which
could limit the potential for trait matching. Also, annual variation
in soil nutrients limit the pulp composition of fleshy fruits
and, consequently, represents a restriction for the development of sugar-rich
fruits that are be highly attractive to frugivores (Herrera 1998),
limiting trait matching in plant-frugivore systems.
