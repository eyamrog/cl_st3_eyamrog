Fish DNA isolation was carried out according to the protocol
of Aljanabi & Martinez (1997): approximately 50 μg of pectoral
fin fragment was sheared into small pieces before being digested
at 55 °C overnight with 20 μl of proteinase K
(20 mg/ml) in 180 μl of extraction buffer solution (1M
Tris, 0.5M Na Cl2, 1 % SDS). The extracted DNA
was suspended in 150 μl sterile double distilled water and
stored at −20 °C until amplified by PCR (Louizi et
al., 2019). The partial mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase (COI) gene was
amplified using FishF1/F2 and FishR1 universal primers (Ward et al.
2005). Each amplification was performed in a volume of 50
μl containing 0.25 mM of MgCl 2, 0.2 mM of
each dNTP, 1 mM of each primer, 5 μl buffer
(10×) and 10 units of Taq polymerase. The replication cycle
was as follows: 94 °C (3 min), 48 °C (30
s), 72 °C (5 min) for 30 cycles with a
final step at 72 °C for 10 min (Louizi et
al., 2019). The sequencing step was performed at the genotyping-sequencing
platform of the “Institut des Sciences de l'Evolution of Montpellier”
(ISE-M) in France. The sequences are obtained with a Genomix
sequencer (MGX), following the manufacturing recommendations and, using the same
forward and reverse primers as for PCR. Cleaning and alignment
of the sequences was done with MEGA X software (Kumar
et al., 2018). Vouchers (Fig. 2) were kept in the
collection of CRH-Uvira (DRC).
