The objective of this study was to analyze who were
the workers who worked from home in Brazil and how
unequal the probabilities of remote work were, considering different sociodemographic
and work characteristics. For this, we used descriptive graphical and
Kernel density analyzes and Probit regressions based on PNAD COVID-19
microdata.
