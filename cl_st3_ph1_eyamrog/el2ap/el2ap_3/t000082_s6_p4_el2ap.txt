Second, the centrality of a cheater species does not change
the trait disparity pattern that results from mutualisms with cheating
interactions. Although species centrality is one of the best measures
to identify important species in ecological networks (Martín González et
al. 2010), it is not the only force driving the
structure and dynamics of networks. For instance, the distribution of
mutualistic and antagonistic interactions between component species within a network
has an impact in maintaining the network structure when facing
perturbations (Montesinos-Navarro et al. 2017). A next step for our
work is to explore how the position of certain cheating
interactions could change the coevolutionary dynamics.
