To control for urban infrastructure, we calculate the minimum Euclidian
distance from each property to transportation sites (train and subway
stations, main avenues, bus corridor, and highway roads) and amenities
variables (urban parks, libraries, cultural centers, art galleries, theaters, concert
halls, theater movies, malls, race stadium, resorts, sports centers, clubs,
courts, soccer stadiums, elementary school, and high school, hospitals, health
centers, and favelas).
