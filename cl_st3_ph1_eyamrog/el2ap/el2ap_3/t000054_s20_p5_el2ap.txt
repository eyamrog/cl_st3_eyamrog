The point is that Western thought, in its homogenizing and
hegemonic tendency, has believed that its version is the version
of the meaning of life and existence, without recognizing that
other ways of seeing humanity and its existence are also
valid, as well as the world it inhabits. (Beltr√°n 2016:216)
