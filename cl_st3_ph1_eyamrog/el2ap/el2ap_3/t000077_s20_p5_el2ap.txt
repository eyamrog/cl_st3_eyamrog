At the other extreme, with an unexpressive portion of remote
work were the following categories: domestic workers, daily cleaners, cooks
(in households); agriculture assistants and farmers and animal breeders in
general; delivery bikers; truck drivers; janitors; bricklayers, painters, electricians, and
joiners; machine operators and production assistants; bakers, butchers and confectioners;
vehicle mechanics; drivers; among others. In the latter cases, the
tasks performed are clearly not compatible, by definition, with remote
work.
