Moraceae was the second in greater diversity of species, represented
by five morphospecies and ten individuals, four of Ficus hirsuta
Schott, three of Ficus guaranitica Chodat, and one of Ficus
eximia Schott. Two individuals were not identified, named Ficus sp.
1 and Ficus sp. 2. Initially, considering the studies conducted
by Mendonça-Souza (2006), he assumed that they were probably Ficus
adhatodifolia Schott in Spreng. and Ficus obtusiuscula (Miq.) Miq. However,
due to the overlap of vegetative characters between the two
species, information about the pseudofruit will be needed to identify
them. The seedlings obtained in the present were in a
vegetative stage and therefore it was decided not to identify
them at the species level. This genus contains the largest
number of species in the family, with approximately 800 species,
distributed in tropical, subtropical regions and hardly in temperate regions
(Pelissari & Romaniuc-Neto 2013). The ecological balance of forests is
largely aided by these species, because their pseudofruits, called syconium,
serve as food for both mammals, birds and even fish,
promoting a high range of dispersion of their seeds (Mendonça-Souza
2006). Pollination of its flowers is carried out by wasps
through a highly singular mutualistic relationship (Pelissari & Romaniuc-Neto 2013).
