The difference between the upper and lower values of the
shares (Figure 1) is notable. The category with the highest
share of remote work, close to 80% on average for
the period, was that of kindergarten, elementary and high school
teachers or college professors. This category also stood out with
significant potential for remote working in the study by Crowley
and Doran (2020) for Ireland.
