Binici et al. (2010) conducted one such study. The authors
aim to identify the effectiveness of capital controls and other
regulatory measures in managing the volume of financial fluxes. The
study examined 74 countries for the sample period 1995-2005 to
analyze the effectiveness of CFMs on three classes of financial
instruments: equity, FDIs, and debts. Their regressions illustrate that, for
the high income countries in the sample, CFMs on outflows
were effective in reducing the gross volume of financial instruments,
and were the most effective for the debt class. Additionally,
the effectiveness of the CFMs on outflows implemented by high-income
countries was comparatively superior to similar regulatory measures imposed by
medium and low-income countries.
