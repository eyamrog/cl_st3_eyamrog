Understanding and studies on selfie behavior are still limited, with
a few studies, conducted mainly by Asian researchers, on the
negative impacts of selfie behavior on psychological and physical health
(Dokur et al., 2018; Pantic et al. 2017). The results
of such studies showed that selfie behavior is possibly associated
with narcissism, self- centered behavior, low self-esteem, loneliness, and depression.
However, these studies did not use any psychometric instrument to
assess the presence of such behaviors, and such results are
seen only as possible inferences.
