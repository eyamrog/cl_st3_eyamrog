First, consider the results of Global Moran’s I test. Table
2 shows the results for the employment variables using the
weighting matrices discussed above. All results are statistically significant at
1%. Note that all tests show a positive spatial correlation.
This result indicates a similarity’s relationship between the level of
employment and the spatial location of the employment level of
the neighbors, suggesting that the MSP employment spatial pattern is
concentrated in the neighborhoods where neighbors are similar to each
other.
