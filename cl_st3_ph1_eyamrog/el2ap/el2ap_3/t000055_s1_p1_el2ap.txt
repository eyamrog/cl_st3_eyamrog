The “Coleção de Flebotomíneos” (FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB) held at Fiocruz Minas is
a curated biological collection comprised of approximately 80,000 individual specimens
of 370 species of sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae, Phlebotominae) mostly
from the Americas collected over the last 80 years by
entomologists interested in understanding and controlling the vector-borne disease leishmaniases.
Since 2010, the metadata of each of the individual biological
specimens held in FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB, including the back catalogue of those
deposited in previous decades, has been digitized. Here, our resulting
electronic catalogue, containing records for 72,624 of the specimens, including
all of the available provenance information associated with each of
them, is published online through the speciesLink network <http://www.splink.org.br/search?collectioncode=FIOCRUZ- COLFLEB&group=animais&lang=pt&action=openform>
and the Sistema de Informação sobre a Biodiversidade Brasileira (SiBBr)
