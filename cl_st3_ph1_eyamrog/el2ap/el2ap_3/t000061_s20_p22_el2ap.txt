To that extent, the answers corroborate the understanding that the
aesthetic aspect of the USR experience, as an instance of
training that enables mimetic learning, favors the understanding of abstract
concepts, such as those that characterize the field of foundation
of moral behavior. The tension between theory and practice in
USR, especially in the moral field, can be evidenced by
the expressive percentage of 73,1% (19) of respondents who said
they had already experienced an ethical dilemma in the research,
contrasting with 80,5% (21) who admitted that they were not
sufficiently familiar with Resolution NHC No. 510 (Brasil, 2016). In
other words, students were able to recognize an ethical dilemma,
despite their little knowledge of the applicable standard.
