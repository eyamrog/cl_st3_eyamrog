The species can obstruct small streams and channels with its
thick rhizomes (Lorenzi 2000, Amaral et al. 2008) and was
considered the most damaging in Hawaii by forming extensive monospecific
patches (Herrera et al. 2016). According to Correa (1984), H.
coronarium can be used as an ornamental, medicinal, fungicide or
cosmetic plant, and its textile fibers are used to produce
cellulose paste (Kissmann & Groth 1991, Silva 2006, Martins et
al. 2010, Carrara et al. 2012). In the study of
Ferreira et al. (2016) a ban on the sale of
this species in florists and nurseries is suggested as a
means of control to prevent further invasions. Brazil's similar climate
to Southeast Asia conditioned the growth of H. coronarium and
its dispersion reached all Brazilian states, this information can be
confirmed at virtual catalogs of Brazilian national herbariums (Flora do
Brasil 2020). It is possible that its area of occurrence
in the Brazilian territory was caused accidentally by transporting lots
of commercial plants that arrived on ships or motivated for
their use in landscaping (Primack & Rodrigues 2001, Ziller 2001,
Petenon & Pivello 2008).
