Overall, the transition between the in vitro phase to rooting
phase has been a limiting point in the production of
seedlings, as the seedlings, which had grown heterotrophically and under
low light intensities, are then planted in a place where
they must turn into plentifully autotrophic (Kaur 2015). In the
protocol of Neto (2009), this transition has given to a
loss of about 55% of the seedlings, but once passed
this phase, the survival has been high, of about 95%,
that is, once surviving and grown under greenhouse conditions, the
seedlings could be cultivated outside. As for a comparison, in
the protocol of micropropagation of the Cerrado species Jacaranda ulei
Bureau & K. Schum., the survival in the transition between
in vitro and rooting phase has been around 80% (Silveira
et al. 2018).
