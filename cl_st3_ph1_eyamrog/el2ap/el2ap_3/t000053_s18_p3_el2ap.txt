Two preserved sand fly specimens record were included in the
Dataset, these insects were captured using CDC/Shannon traps. After capture,
the insects were screened, being separated, and properly identified with
the capture location. The insects were clarified using the procedure
proposed by Forattini (1973) [23]. After the clarification process, the
specimens were mounted between slide and cover slip in Enece
medium (Cerqueira, 1943) [24] and identified according to Galati [2].
