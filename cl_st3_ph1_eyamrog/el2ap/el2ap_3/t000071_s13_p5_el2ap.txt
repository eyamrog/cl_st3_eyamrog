On the peer-review question, we asked the 14 publishers who
responded to our original inquiry, if they would allow us
limited use of password access to their peer review process
(based on our knowledge of OJS). Five publishers granted us
access to a journal (Table 1). In spot-checking an average
of 12 recent articles per journal, we found four of
the five publishers’ journals had complete sets of reviews, while
the fifth was missing reviews for three articles out of
20. There were 1.6 reviews per article on average, although
24 percent of the reviews contained only a recommendation to
publish without comment, suggesting that there is much work to
be done on improving peer review quality. In sum, of
the original randomly selected 50 publishers using OJS on Beall’s
list, 14.0 percent largely compliant with Beall’s basic criteria, with
five of the seven providing direct evidence of peer review.
