Table 5 presents the mean and standard deviation of the
factors in relation to the selfitis's intensity levels. The means
showed that participants with low selfitis's intensity level had the
highest mean (3.39) in "environmental enhancement"; "mood and confidence" factor
had the highest mean (3.21) for those with mild selfitis's
intensity level; "subjective conformity" factor reached the highest mean (3.19)
among those with moderate selfitis's intensity level; and "attention seeking"
and "social competition" factors had the highest mean (4.02 and
3.45, respectively) among those with severe selfitis's intensity level.
