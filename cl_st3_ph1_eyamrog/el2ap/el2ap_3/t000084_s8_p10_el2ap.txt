An essential characteristic of creating social presence in face-to-face settings
is visual cues that individuals express. In online environments, individuals
often have never communicated in person, which can create challenges
in establishing social presence. Kuehn (1993) and Walther (1994) described
ways participants create a connection through the use of emoticons
or other symbols to add affective elements in computer-mediated conversations.
These resources helped establish social presence and added emoticons to
the online experience (Bai, Dan, Mu, & Yang, 2019).
