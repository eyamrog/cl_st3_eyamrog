The results of the empirical model showed that an important
part of the pattern found in the descriptive analysis reflects
differences in selection into occupations and sectors, because almost all
coefficients were significantly reduced when fixed effects for types of
work, position, or function were included. There was a significant
reduction in the public sector-effect, showing that the very high
participation of remote work among public sector workers visualized in
the descriptive analysis results from a composition effect, or from
the types of task prevalent in the public sector.
