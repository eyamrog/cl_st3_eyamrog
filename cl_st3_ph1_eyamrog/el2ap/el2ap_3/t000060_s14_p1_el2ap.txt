The corpus of this research consists of Jodi Ann Arias’s
trial, which gained massive attention from the media. On May
8, 2013, she was convicted of first-degree murder of her
ex- boyfriend Travis Victor Alexander in the United States. On
June 4, 2008, Alexander was shot in the head, repeatedly
stabbed, and had his throat cut. His body was discovered
by friends in the shower of his home about five
days later. They called 911 and when questioned by the
police, they said Arias should be interrogated. On July 9,
2008, Arias was indicted on first- degree murder charges in
Alexander’s death. She was arrested on July 15, 2008, and
sentenced to natural life in prison (with no possibility of
parole) on April 13, 2015 in the State of Arizona.
She is imprisoned at Arizona State Prison Complex – Perryville,
Lumley Unit.
