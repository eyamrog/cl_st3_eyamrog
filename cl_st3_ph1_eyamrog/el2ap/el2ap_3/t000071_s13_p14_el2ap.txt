To support the public value of open access and the
global expansion of scholarly publishing, PKP is developing new tools
for assessing and communicating scholarly trustworthiness. This will involve journals
turning to third-party trade organizations to verify and register who
is doing what in the publishing process, with an example
involving ORCiD, a researcher identity and profile management organization, presented
below. Initially, the goal is to work with five basic
scholarly standards, before considering more granular and specialized standards around,
for example, clinical trials (Table 5). These systems will depend
on the exchange of information between journals and these organizations,
with an openness to a level of scrutiny not possible
today, whether in seeing the background of a journalâ€™s reviewers
or how many reviews a paper is typically subject to.
While involving automated connections and controls, the outcomes will be
subject to human review and challenge. Through open source licensing
of the connecting technologies, such developments will also be made
available to commercial and other platforms.
