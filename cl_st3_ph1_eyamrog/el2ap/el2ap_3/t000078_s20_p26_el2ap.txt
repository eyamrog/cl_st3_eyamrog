As described in the previous section, the coefficients of the
CBD variable estimated by OLS are robust to the different
functional forms and specifications, presenting expected signals in all models
(Table 4, columns 5-8); however, such models have spatial dependence.
When estimating the model with the control by SBD using
the SLX estimator, the total effect of the CBD presents
the expected signals for both matrices of weight considered (Table
6, columns 18 and 19). The results validate the econometric
estimation and support the polycentric hypothesis of SÃ£o Paulo.
