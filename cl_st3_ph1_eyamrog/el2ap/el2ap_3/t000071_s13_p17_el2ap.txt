Although the lack of transparency and clarity in the degree
to which journals adhere to scholarly standards applies to the
larger world of scholarly publishing, these verification and communication systems
will also, of course, help reduce the number of journals
mislabeled as “predatory.” To make journals adherence to scholarly standards
explicit in publicly accessible ways may well encourage wider use
of this work. Journalists and other professionals would get into
the habit of checking the label before using research, while
reading such labels could well form part of what high
school and college students would learn about science. Such an
industry standard for scholarly publishing seems to go hand in
hand with universal open access and public support for research.
