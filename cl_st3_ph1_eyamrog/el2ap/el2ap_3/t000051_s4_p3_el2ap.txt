That shift is constructed as a necessity, not a choice,
to protect the existence of Germany from Russian aggression, “today
and in the future”. Despite envisaging a lasting conflict with
Russia and a paradigm shift also in diplomatic position, the
Ukraine war is presented as “Putin’s war”, an aggression by
an isolated individual that has no public support in his
country. So rather than a profound military threat, it seems
that it is Putin’s mere challenge of the NATO world
order that in Scholz’s view has ushered in a new
era, also evident in a latent regime change discourse. Scholz’s
analysis of Putin’s perspective is supported by the sole argument
that Russia has invaded Ukraine, and no further arguments seem
necessary as Scholz speaks from a perspective of NATO hegemony
(see Section 3). Scholz takes the invasion of Ukraine, stripped
of all its context and pre-history, as legitimation to engage
in astonishing claims on Putin’s motives and ambitions, unbacked by
any serious political or historical analysis. Potential voices arguing that
Putin sought dialogue for decades are brushed away through denial
(see example 6). Instead, through methods of neutralisation (BAXTER, 2011,
p.171; DEETZ, 1992), the conflict is elevated into a conflict
of good vs evil, of the free world against oppression.
