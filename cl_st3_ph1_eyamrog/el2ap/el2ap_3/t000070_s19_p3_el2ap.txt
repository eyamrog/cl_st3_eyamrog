Concerning the germination speed index (GSI), no significant differences were
found between cryopreserved (+LN) and non-cryopreserved (-LN) seeds. Seeds submitted
to the conservation methods started to germinate on the 7th
day of cultivation, and the maximum germination point was observed
on the 15th day. The seeds collected at 150 DAA
had an average GSI equal to 17.0, being, statistically, the
largest and the most significant (p<0,05) when compared to the
results of seeds collected at 120 and 135 DAA (table
2).
