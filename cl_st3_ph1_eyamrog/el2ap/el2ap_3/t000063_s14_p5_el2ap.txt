The resulting cohort included 983 adolescents (63.5% women) of 14
to 19 years of age (mean 16.7, 66% 16-18) from
all different states in Mexico distributed in a non-representative way
according to their population, of whom 971 (98.8%) were in
school (69.8% in public schools), most in their last years
of high school (77%) and 48% reported that none of
their parents underwent university studies. (Fig.1)
