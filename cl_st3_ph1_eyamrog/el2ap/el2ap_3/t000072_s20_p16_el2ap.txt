In a study conducted by Neto et al. (2020), the
Shannon index was higher during the rainy season, with a
value of 2.23, in which these samples were withdrawn between
November and April 2017. During the dry season, between the
months of May and October of 2017, the index was
1.57, much lower than that found in the present study.
On the other hand, in a study carried out by
Pi√±a- Rodrigues & Aoki (2014), observing the deposition of seeds
in fragments of semideciduous forest, it was found that the
greatest deposition of seeds was at the end of the
dry season and at the beginning of the wet season,
comprising the September onwards. However, as several studies point out
that the greatest deposition of seeds occurs at the end
of the dry season and the beginning of the humid
one (Braga et al. 2016), the collection was chosen in
September to contemplate greater diversity. Therefore, one of the factors
that influence the density and composition of species is the
variation of climatic factors (Dalling 2002).
