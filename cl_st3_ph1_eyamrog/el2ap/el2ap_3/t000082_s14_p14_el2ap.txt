Finally, we compare the coevolutionary dynamics of the Central scenario
with the scenario in which cheating interactions were randomly distributed
across the network (the Random scenario). To create the Random
scenario, we measure the frequency of negative effects in networks
(fCh) in the Central scenario, as shown in Equation 10,
and use this value of frequency as a p in
the networks of the Random scenario. We considered n(-+) as
the number of cheating interactions and n(++) as the number
of mutualistic interactions in the network.
