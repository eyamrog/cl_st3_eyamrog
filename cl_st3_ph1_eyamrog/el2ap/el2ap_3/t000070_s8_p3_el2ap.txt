In the effort to protect Bromeliads, several strategies have been
used to better understand and support future studies. In V.
reitzii, certain studies use biotechnological techniques as conservation tools, such
as in vitro cultivation with the nodular cultures (NCs) production.
NCs can be considered as a morphogenic response pattern with
high regenerative potential since they have the ability to generate
more than 5300 micro sprouts g-1 in 10 weeks of
cultivation, which can be generated from leaf base (Dal Vesco
& Guerra 2010, Guerra & Dal Vesco 2010, Dal Vesco
et al. 2014a) or seeds (Dal Vesco et al. 2014b).
In addition to the morphological and histochemical characterizations regarding the
induction and origin of nodular cultures (Corredor-Prado et al. 2015),
proteomic analyzes and identification of differentially expressed proteins involved during
the induction and regeneration of nodular cultures (Corredor-Prado et al.
2016, 2019), as well as in the dynamics of changes
in the levels of proteins, carbohydrates and global DNA methylation
during the induction of NCs. (Corredor-Prado et al. 2020).
