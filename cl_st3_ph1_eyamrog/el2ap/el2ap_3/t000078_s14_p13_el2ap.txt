We used a collection of databases. In the first stage
estimation, the employment data of Annual Social Information Report (RAIS
– Relação Anual de Informações Sociais) produced by the Ministry
of Labor is used to identify the SBD. It covers
all formally established (incorporated) organizations (public and private) and workers
with a labor card and is considered a census of
formal workers. RAIS is restricted to the formal labor market,
and it is a limitation of our analysis since we
are not considering the informal labor market. However, in 2013,
formal employment represented 66% of the labor force localized in
the Metropolitan Area of São Paulo according to the National
Household Sample Survey (PNAD – Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de
Domicílios). The geocoding of firms and aggregation of workers by
Census tracts were conducted by the Municipal Secretariat for Urban
Development (SMDU – Secretaria Municipal de Desenvolvimento Urbano) of the
Municipality of São Paulo (MSP). The MSP has 310 Census
tracts, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics
(IBGE).
