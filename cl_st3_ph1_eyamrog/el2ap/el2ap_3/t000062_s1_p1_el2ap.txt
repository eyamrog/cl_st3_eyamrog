(Impact of Hedychium coronarium J. König (Zingiberaceae) on the assembly
of spiders in the Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga,
São Paulo State, Brazil). The invasive Hedychium coronarium J. König
(Zingiberaceae) is a competitive terrestrial herb. To understand the ecological
relationships and verify whether H. coronarium impacts the mounting of
spiders in the soil, 45 traps were installed, distributed in
three treatments and three replicas. All spiders (292 individuals) collected
between January and December 2018 were identified. The Intermediate Areas
had the highest number of individuals collected and the highest
diversity index, with 107 spiders collected (37% of the total),
distributed in 14 species, followed by Dominated Areas with 97
individuals (33%) distributed in 12 species and Free Areas with
88 individuals (30%), distributed in 10 species. The analysis showed
that the assembly of spiders in Parque Estadual das Fontes
do Ipiranga does not present significant differences, these results may
not be the result of chance and be related to
H. coronarium. Furthermore, two families showed differences in their distribution.
