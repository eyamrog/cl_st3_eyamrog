Although the species richness was small and the number of
collected adult individuals was low, it was possible to make
a Cluster analysis that indicated 82% similarity in the composition
of families between the IA and DA treatments (figure 4).
The IA treatment showed a greater number of species (14),
followed by DA with nine and FA with four species
(table 1), but the treatments not differentiated from each other.
