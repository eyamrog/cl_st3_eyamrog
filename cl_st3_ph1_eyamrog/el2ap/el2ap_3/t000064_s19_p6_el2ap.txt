In the control group and in the garden group, the
external periclinal cell wall and cuticle could not be distinguished
from one another (figures 6 a, b, f), and these
layers are called here the outer layer of epidermal cells.
Hence, this layer in the plants under plentiful sunlight was
considerably thicker (figures 6 a-c) than those in the other
growth conditions (figures 6 d-e). Nonetheless, the epidermis presented an
intermediate thickness in plants in the greenhouse condition (figure 6
e).
