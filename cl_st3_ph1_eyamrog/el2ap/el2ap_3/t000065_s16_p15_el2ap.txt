Focusing on the interlanguage itself, Queiroz (2019) explores CorIFA deeply
to shed light on novice writers’ use of noun phrases.
These phrases have been regarded as a common linguistic feature
in expert academic texts, mainly research articles (Biber et al.,
2009; Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014; Gray, 2015; Biber & Gray,
2016). To investigate the grammatical complexity of noun phrases (NPs),
the study analyzes general topic essays and specific topic essays21
from a CorIFA subcorpus and provides a thorough description of
pre and post-modification of the types: adjective + noun and
noun + prepositional phrase. Two of the study's findings are
particularly noteworthy. First, surprisingly, the subcorpus analysis of upper-intermediate level
texts revealed a higher use of complex NPs (59.3%) than
simple ones (35%). Second, NPs were more frequent in the
specific topic essays, which is interpreted as quite positive writing
practice as complex NPs are characteristic of academic registers: “it
can be assumed that Brazilian learners due to their proficiency
level [B2], the academic context of writing, and the probable
contact with specialized texts in English from their own disciplines,
are capable of using structurally complex and compressed phrasal structures,
often characteristic of professional academic writing” (QUEIROZ, 2019, p. 112).
Above all, this last result shows that discipline-specific tasks can
propel writing at the university level that is more suitable
to the academic context. This research makes evident the potential
of descriptive corpus-based research to contribute to applied linguistics, in
this case, EAP. The corpus design allowed a task variable
(specific topic versus general topic task) to emerge as the
one that affected NP use by Brazilian upper-intermediate level university
novice writers.
