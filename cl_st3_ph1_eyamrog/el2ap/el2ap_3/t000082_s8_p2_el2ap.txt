Mutualistic interactions, for example, can favor trait matching, which is
the trait similarity between interacting species. Although mutualisms may also
generate other trait patterns, such as intensification of traits (Anderson
& Johnson 2008), trait matching is an observed pattern in
a variety of mutualistic systems, such as pollination by flies
and bees (Zhang et al. 2012, Santamaria & Rodríguez-Gironés 2007),
seed dispersal by birds and bats (Galetti et al. 2013,
Mello et al. 2011), and Müllerian rings in velvet ants
(Wilson et al 2012). Hence, trait matching is an expected
outcome of reciprocal selection that could favor higher interaction efficiency
in mutualisms (Thompson 1994, Zhang et al. 2012). In contrast,
antagonisms, such as parasites and hosts, favor trait mismatching between
hosts and parasites, leading to several coevolutionary dynamics such as
coevolutionary alternation and escalation, that favor the maintenance or the
increase in trait variation across and within species (Andreazzi et
al. 2017).
