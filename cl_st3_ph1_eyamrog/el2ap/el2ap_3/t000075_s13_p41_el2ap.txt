Another important contribution of these mainstream studies was the investigation
of the relative effectiveness of the prudential measures and capital
controls imposed by developed and emerging economies in addition to
the analysis of the spillover effects. These studies are extremely
useful to the debate on the multilateral aspects of capital
controls and are therefore indispensable in future discussions about the
international coordination of CFMs. Prudential measures (that discriminate based on
the currency denomination of the transaction) imposed by developed countries
were more effective in reducing the volume of cross-border capital
flows vis-à-vis capital controls (that discriminate based on the investor’s
residency) imposed by emerging markets. One can derive these conclusions
from the studies by Binici et al. (2010), Ghosh et
al. (2014), and Aizenman and Binici (2016). Figure 2 systematizes
the relative effectiveness of CFMs imposed by developing and developed
economies - in the latter case, the measures are basically
prudential policies.
