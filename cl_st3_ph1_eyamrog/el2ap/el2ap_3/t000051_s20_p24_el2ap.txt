The fifth and last point Scholz makes is that “Putin’s
war” represents a “Zäsur” (‘caesura’) for German foreign policy, which
again invokes the watershed discourse. Compared to the previous courses
of action, he is less clear on what future foreign
policy will look like, other than that “wir werden uns
Gesprächen mit Russland nicht verweigern” (‘we will not refuse talks
with Russia’), which implies that “we” will not seek them
either. The judgement “Alles andere halte ich für unverantwortlich” (‘Anything
else, I believe, would be irresponsible’) entertains potential voices that
demand a diplomatic rupture with Russia. Voices that argue that
talks with Russia should be sought are not envisaged by
this statement. Scholz wants to avoid being “naive”, which he
defines as “kein Reden um des Redens willen” (‘no talking
for the sake of talking). Using a dialogically contractive concurrence,
he judges that Putin has never been interested in dialogue
(example 6). This assertion heaps all the blame and responsibility
on Putin and shows that Scholz has no faith at
all in the effectiveness of dialogue. The envisaged caesura for
German foreign policy, thus, seems to entail, as was stated
above, a lasting conflict with Russia.
