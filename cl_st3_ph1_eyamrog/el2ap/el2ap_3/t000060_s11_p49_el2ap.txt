Facework is defined by the author as everything a person
does so that his actions do not make anyone lose
face, including his own. Unlike politeness, facework is composed of
practices that aim to establish, enhance, threaten or weaken the
interlocutor’s image. Politeness, however, concerns behaviours related to people’s need
to be approved and to ensure their autonomy. Originally based
on the notion of face formulated by Goffman (1974), Brown
and Levinson (1987) expanded the concept of politeness, pointing out
two aspects of the socially constructed self-image: negative face and
positive face.
