Furthermore, intracellular ice crystal formation is the most damaging event
during the cryopreservation process. The damage is irreversible. It can
occur during freezing or thawing and may lead to cell
wall rupture, epidermal rupture, protoplast egress, anomalous nuclei of surviving
explants, or explant death (Kaviani 2011). Anatomical studies, such as
the one carried out by Wesley- Smith et al. (2014,
2015), report the importance of understanding the interactions of water
content and ice structure through studies for the atomization of
cryogenic processes and cell survival since ice crystal size and
cell damage can have late effects on cell death.
