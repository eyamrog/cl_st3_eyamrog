Authorship concentration at the journal level, aggregating all five years,
was indicated by the proportion (or rather percentage) of articles
published by the most prolific author and the Gini coefficient.
Each journalâ€™s most prolific author was whoever had published more
articles in that journal, and the proportion of articles was
simply the ratio between the number of these articles and
the journal size (total amount of signed articles in that
journal). The Gini coefficient (zero meaning complete equality and one
meaning complete inequality) was calculated following Jasso (1979); see Davidson
(2009) for a discussion of the relative merits of each
way of calculating the Gini coefficient.
