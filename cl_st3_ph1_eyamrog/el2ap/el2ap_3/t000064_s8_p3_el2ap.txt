Vellozia squamata Pohl, sometimes named by its synonym, Vellozia flavicans
Mart ex Schult (Smith & Ayensu 1974), is a common
species from the Cerrado of the central region of Brazil
(Flora do Brasil 2020). The obtention of seedlings from seeds
of this species failed due to a high mortality of
the young plants (Neto 2009), just as other Vellozia species
(Alves 1994). Also, the production of seedlings by stem cuttings
ended unsuccessfully (Neto 2009).
