The germination test was conducted in vitro and the seeds
were placed in Petri dishes (60 x15 mm), on sterilized
filter paper, soaked with 2.0 mL of liquid culture medium
MS (Murashige & Skoog 1962), and added with Morel vitamins
(Morel & Wetmore 1951) and 30 g L-1 of sucrose.
The pH was adjusted to 5.8 before sterilisation in an
autoclave for 20 minutes at 121 °C and 1.3 atm.
The cultivations were kept in a BOD chamber at 25
ºC ± 2 ºC for a 16 hours photoperiod of
light in a luminous intensity of 55 ± μmol m-2
s-1.
