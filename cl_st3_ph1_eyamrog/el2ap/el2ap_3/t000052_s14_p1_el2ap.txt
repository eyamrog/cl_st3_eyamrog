The parasites described in this study were collected from 11
specimens of Auchenoglanis occidentalis (Claroteidae, Siluriformes). They were captured in
the North- Western part of the lake, a few meters
from the orthodox church in Uvira (Northern part) and at
the Mouth of River Mutambala (Southern part) (Fig. 1). They
were killed by severing their chordal spines, and identified on
site as Auchenoglanis occidentalis using the Fermon et al. (2012)
keys. The gills and a small section of the pectoral
fins were stored in 96% ethanol.
