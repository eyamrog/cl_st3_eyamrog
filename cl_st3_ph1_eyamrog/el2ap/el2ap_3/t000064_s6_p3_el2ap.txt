The leaves from plants grown in vitro conditions show typical
effects of shading (Barboza et al. 2006, Chaari-Rkhis et al.
2015, Ziv & Chen 2008), with poorly developed anatomical structures,
including stomata. Moreover, some ultrastructural features of shaded leaves are
the limited cytoplasmic content and flattened chloroplast with an irregularly
arranged internal membrane system and a higher proportion of intercellular
spaces (Wetzstein & Sommer 1982, Chirin√©a et al. 2012). In
the present work, some of these features include qualitative alterations,
as the absence of aquiferous cells, subepidermal sclerenchyma fascicles, and
stomatal crypts.
