At a first glance, we might think that he seeks
to summarize the events in order to check if he
understood them well (“So... after two o’CLOCK... that... you... took
everything and put it down in the car correct?”). However,
by asking her to answer if this information was correct,
he asks her to make the decision to confirm it,
and uses the interactional discourse marker correct, which suggests that

strategy is obviously the best for him to base a
subsequent question on. By means of using so and correct
in the same question, he tries to lead her to
confirm that what he was saying was an acceptable version
of the truth, leading the audience to assume that his
interpretation is valid by obtaining confirmation of a version of
events that he had in mind. Besides, as it was
already mentioned, he uses a so-prefaced question which plays, according
