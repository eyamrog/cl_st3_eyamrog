The testimonial in Excerpt 1 seemed to have a particularly
strong impact on all participants because the world had recently
watched demonstrations carried out by the Black Lives Matter movement6
in the USA. At the same time in Brazil, people
were affected by the news of the death of Miguel7,
a five-year old black kid, who had been left alone
by his mother’s employer before falling nine floors in a
luxury seaside apartment. It was clear that this testimonial (see
Excerpt 1) caught participants’ attention as they nodded in agreement
and displayed their surprised face while carefully watching or listening
to each testimonial that was voluntarily shared in the group.
