In this initial phase, conducted from July to December of
2018, we worked through Beall’s 2017 list until we had
identified 50 publishers and 51 standalone journals using OJS. We
then emailed the publishers and editors and publishers, noting their
appearance on Beall’s list and offering to provide guidance on
their journal websites. Of those contacted, 14 publishers (representing 113
journals) and two of the standalone journals responded with interest.
We then reviewed example journals for each publisher. We were
guided, in part, by Beall’s Criteria for Determining Predatory Open-Access
Publishers, for which the 54 bullet points range from “no
single individual is identified as any specific journal’s editor” (p.
2) to “the publisher has an optional ‘fast-track’ fee-based service
for expedited peer review which appears to provide assured publication
with little or no vetting” (2015, p. 6). Two of
the publishers, Scholar Science Journals and Khalsa Publisher upgraded several
features within a month of our emails, while COES&RJ (Center
of Excellence for Scientific & Research Journalism) responded that it
was acting on our advice.8 Three of the fourteen publishers
stated that they had unsuccessfully petitioned Beall to take them
off the list, while a fourth convinced Beall to note
their inclusion in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ).
