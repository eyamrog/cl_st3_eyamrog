Although several studies have been done on the use of
this species and recent warnings about the impacts caused by
this plant, studies related to arthropods, especially spiders, are scarce
in the literature. Spiders are a megadiverse group with characteristics
that make it possible to occupy different environments (World Spider
Catalog 2021), they are grouped into guilds according to habitat
and foraging (Uetz 1977, Cardoso et al. 2011), are known
as efficient pest population controllers (Aguilar 1988, Fl√≥rez 2000) and
can interact with invasive plants indirectly and any change in
the spider assembly changes the arthropod community (Mgobozi et al.
2008). According Bultman & De-Witt (2008), the invasive alien species
Vinca minor L. (Apocynaceae) influenced the mobility of native spiders,
reducing their abundance.
