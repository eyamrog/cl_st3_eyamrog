The very conception of biodiversity as a set of resources
is misleading: Klier (2016) and Martínez et al. (2018) agree
in stating that the preservation of biodiversity is assumed in
western policies as the conservation of “the other”, that is,
of animals, plants, and areas that, due to their characteristics,
differ from the model of what is considered a developed
society. In this way, communities and cultural practices associated with
biodiversity and its responsible use by the members of these
communities are excluded, and nature is given the connotation of
merchandise. Developing countries, on the other hand, need to boost
their economy, and most of them cannot do so if
it is not at the expense of the rational use
of that biological diversity that they must also protect. The
concept of bioeconomy has recently emerged to define the efficient
use of biological and natural resources, as well as the
use of their waste to reduce the use of fossil
energy and decarbonize the economy (Hodson, Henry y Trigo 2019).
