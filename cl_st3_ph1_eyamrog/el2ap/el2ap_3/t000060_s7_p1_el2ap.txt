As stated by Schegloff (2001, p. 230), conversational interaction can
be thought of as a “form of social organization through
which the work of the constitutive institutions of societies gets
done − institutions such as the economy, the polity, the
family, socialization, etc”, and it is “the basic and primordial
environment for the development, the use, and the learning of
natural language”. From this perspective, we have developed an interest
in applying conversation analysis to interactions in forensic settings and
the tools that speakers can employ to achieve specific goals
and results. This research therefore consists of a textual- interactive
approach to the spoken language, which is based on the
interface between the concepts of conversation analysis and forensic linguistics.
Above all, we intend to analyse how formulations, politeness, and
facework are employed by speakers in courtroom interactions to achieve
specific goals. We have analysed some elements such as: adjacency
pairs “question/answer”, so-prefaced questions, discourse markers, paraphrases, face threatening acts,
mitigation devices, verbal planning markers, formulations prefaced by discourse markers,
tag questions, and three central properties of formulations which are
preservation, transformation, and deletion.
