Benjamin (1985), in turn, took mimesis from a perspective more
similar to that adopted by Aristotle, perceiving a (cri)active character
inherent in human mimetic behavior (Gagnebin, 1993). This is because
mimetic behavior presents elements of a knowledge relationship with the
active participation of the subject, who needs to form an
image of the environment to make it possible, rather than
simply being able to recognize similarities, it is necessary to
produce similarities (Benjamin, 1985). Indeed, the human being, unlike the
chameleon, for example, is not able to change the color
of his own skin, he needs to imagine the object
or subject to be imitated and rationally create mechanisms that
allow the representation. As this production does not generate perfect
copies, it forces the subject to (creatively) fill gaps based
on his subjectivity. Benjamin (1985) uses writing as an example:
even writing letters, understood as a simple imitation task that
could produce perfect copies, is impregnated with the personal traits
of the writer.
