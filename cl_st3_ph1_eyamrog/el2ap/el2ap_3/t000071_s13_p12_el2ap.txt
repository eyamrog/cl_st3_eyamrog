We take little comfort from the proportion of journals using
OJS on these two lists. An open source publishing platform
that is free to download and documents setting up and
operating journals might have been expected to be more widely
used by fake journals. It may be that OJS’ design,
dedicated to providing editorial oversight of peer review, is off-putting
to those with no such intent, or that the platform’s
design and support enable journals to rise above the subjective
judgments behind the “predatory” label. Still, some journals are almost
certainly using OJS to illegitimately charge authors for publishing their
submissions without peer review to the detriment of science. While
there is evidence of overcounting on both lists, the proportion
of journals using OJS is higher in the more recent
list maintained by Cabells Predatory Reports (3.2 percent) than in
Beall’s list (1.2 percent), just as Cabells appears to be
providing greater coverage of journals in the Global South than
Beall. This increase may reflect OJS’ growth rate, which only
adds to our responsibilities as platform developers to address this
issue.
