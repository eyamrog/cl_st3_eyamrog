This context, prior to the workshop, is understood as collaborative
itself, as it implies people working together and mutually supporting
one another. Such an environment demands trust and dedication from
each party to achieve a common objective shared by the
group. These characteristics follow the philosophical trail, proposed by Spinoza
(2003, IV, p. 9), which says that when “(…) two
individuals of entirely the same nature are united, they form
a combination twice as powerful as either of them singly”.
In this sense, the collaborative perspective implies engaging with others
towards some common ground to enhance everyone’s potential for existence,
that is, finding out ways to interact, which enable collective
and individual growth.
