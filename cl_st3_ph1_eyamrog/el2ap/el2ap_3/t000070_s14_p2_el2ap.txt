The moisture content (%) of the seeds was obtained from
a pool of 1000 seeds of different fruit collection times.
The oven method was used at 105 ± 3 ºC
for 24 ± 1 hours, according to Brazil (2009), using
four replications of 200 seeds. The moisture content, expressed on
a wet basis, was obtained through the expression: <>. Where:
Iw: Initial weight of the sample (g); Fw: Final sample
weight (g) and X%: water content in percentage of wet
basis (w.b), %.
