The last activity in the workshop that will be described
and discussed in this paper was named The change I
want to see is. It was conducted after some questions,
answers, and testimonials were shared in the group. During this
activity, participants were invited to write, in the chat, the
change they hoped for. This would be their final remark
in the workshop. The idea was to explore their creativity
using everything that was shared in the workshop. They were
encouraged to express what they were looking forward to achieving
personally or to seeing change in the world. They had
a few minutes to reflect upon what they would say
and, all together, entered their thoughts in the chat. All
participants could see one anotherâ€™s posts and these were read
out loud by one of the facilitators. Excerpt 4 illustrates
some of the posts.
