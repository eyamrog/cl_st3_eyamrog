Face validity assessment of the SBS was performed using the
sample of the pilot application of the scale with the
participation of 45 adolescents. This application of the scale was
essential to assess face validity, which includes the understanding, clarity,
and simplicity of the language used in the questionnaire (Campos
et al., 2019).
