The history of the Lake Tanganyika parasitic fauna begins with
the description of Ancyrocephalus limnothrissae Paperna, 1973 from the gills
of Limnothrissa miodon (Boulenger 1906). This species was redescribed under
the name Kapentagyrus limnothrissae by Kmentova et al. (2018). The
second description of Lake Tanganyikaâ€™s monogenean species was one belonging
to Gyrodactylus by Vanhove et al. (2011). Since then, the
number of studies in Lake Tanganyika monogeneans has increased, with
particular attention given to Cichlidogyrus monogenean of Cichlid fish, which
currently has 30 published and 10 other undescribed species (Rahmouni
2017, 2020, 2021).
