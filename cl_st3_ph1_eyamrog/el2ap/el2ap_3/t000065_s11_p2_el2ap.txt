Any selection of texts is a sample. Whether or not
a sample is 'representative', however, depends first of all on
the extent to which it is selected from the range
of text types in the target population; an assessment of
this representativeness thus depends on a prior full definition of
the 'population' that the sample is intended to represent, and
the techniques used to select the sample from that population.
