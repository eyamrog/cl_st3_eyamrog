As there is sometimes a correlation between water quality and
helminth infections (e.g. in the Cyprinid fish (Zargar et al.
2012)), overdispersion of Bagrobdella vanhovei and the absence of B.
vansteenbergei in the other six host individuals captured off the
Orthodox Church of Uvira could be due to different water
qualities at the level of these two sampling sites. Thus,
Bagrobdella vansteenbergei could be adapted to the conditions found at
the Mouth of Mutambala River, while Bagrobdella vanhovei could be
more resistant to variations of abiotic conditions.
