The first published study were carried out by Martins and
Silva (1964) [7] on the sand fly fauna in the
capital Rio Branco recording 30 species, with Pintomyia nevesi (Damasceno
& Arouck, 1956) being the dominant species. In the early
1980s, Arias and Freitas [8] carried out researches in the
municipalities of Cruzeiro do Sul, Feijó and Rio Branco, found
50 species, with Trichophoromyia auraensis (Mangabeira, 1942) the most frequent.
In the late 2000's, Azevedo et al. [9], in the
municipalities of Rio Branco, Bujari and Xapuri found a predominance
of Nyssomyia whitmani (Antunes & Coutinho, 1939), Ny. antunesi (Coutinho,
1939) and Th. auraensis. At the same time, Silva-Nunes et
al. [10] in rural areas of the municipality of Acrelândia
found a predominance of Ny. whitmani and Ny. antunesi. Similar
observations have also been made in peri-urban and forest areas
of Rio Branco [6, 11]. In Assis Brasil, 67 species
were collected, with three new records for Acre, Evandromyia georgii
(Freitas & Barret 2002), Lutzomyia evangelistai Martins & Fraiha 1971
and Psychodopygus complexus (Mangabeira, 1941), with the most abundant species
being Trichophoromyia spp. (Th. auraensis / Th. ruifreitasi) and Ps.
davisi (Root, 1934) both found with Leishamnia braziliensis Vianna 1911
and L. guyanensis Floch, 1954 by molecular techniques [12]. In
this same locality, two species were described Lutzomyia naiffi Teles
et al. 2013 and Th. ruifreitasi Oliveira et al. 2015,
being the female of this indistinguishable from several others of
the genus Trichophoromyia. In addition, Assis Brazil has recently unveiled
new records of sand fly species [13, 14, 15].
