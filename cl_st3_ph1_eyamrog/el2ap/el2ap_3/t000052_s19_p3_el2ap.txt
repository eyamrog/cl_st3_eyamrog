Remarks. Bagrobdella vanhovei has seven pairs of hooks of different
sizes, and has a trapeze-shaped piece associated with the median
projection of the ventral bar (Fig. 6, latter visible in
15 of the 78 studied specimens), both characters have been
mentioned in the descriptions of the four already known species
in this genus. Its dorsal anchors have a long point,
while its ventral anchors have a very short one, like
in Bagrobdella auchenoglanii and B. fraudulenta (B. parauchenoglanii and B.
anthopenis having points of the same size for both ventral
and dorsal anchors). Bagrobdella vanhovei could be easily distinguished from
all species already described by the morphology of its MCO
which is unique (sub-terminal opening) (Fig. 5).
