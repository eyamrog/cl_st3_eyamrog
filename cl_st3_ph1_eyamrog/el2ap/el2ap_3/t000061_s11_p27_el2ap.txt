The formative potential of USR resides, fundamentally, in the fact
that it enables the realization of the human tendency to
learning through imitation, recognized by all authors who serve as
the central foundation of this text. In the title Minima
moralia, Adorno (1993: 147) states that “[the] human clings to
imitation: a human being becomes truly human only when he
imitates other human beings”. This aspect is essential to think
of USR as a privileged instance for the formation of
researchers' morality, as in which, according to Adorno (2009), the
process of human formation moves by mimetic identification with individuals
who contain the universal, in this case, humanity.
