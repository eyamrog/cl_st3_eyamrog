Although the weighting matrices (queen, rook, and ùëò neighbors) point
to different results, they have smaller deviations from the aggregate
result than the distance weight matrix. To consider the SBD
candidates from the city of S√£o Paulo, we only take
those that are statistically significant for all specifications and those
areas characterized as HH and HL clusters. In this case,
with at least 5% significance, 37 tract areas are found
as candidates for SBD, and all of them are labeled
as HH only, as displayed in Table 3. For the
three spatial weighting matrix specifications (queen, rook, and k neighbors),
only one weighting area is not significant for the rook
and queen specification simultaneously. As a result, 36 weighting areas
are considered as SBD candidates.
