Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was performed from seeds of
each treatment, fixed in a glutaraldehyde solution (2.5%) in 0.1
M sodium cacodylate buffer pH 7.2 and 0.2 M sucrose
at 4 °C overnight; followed by immersion in 0.3 M
sodium cacodylate buffer solution, pH 7.2, 0.6 M sucrose and
H2O, five times, reducing the concentration of sucrose in each
wash by 25% and in osmium tetroxide (2%) and 0.2
M sodium cacodylate, pH 7.2 (1: 1, v v) for
4 hours at room temperature. The dehydration in an increasing
series of acetone (30 - 100 °GL) and pre- infiltration
in series of acetone and Spurr resin solutions (3:1, 2:1,
1:1, 1:2, 1:3) and infiltrated in Spurr resin. Sections (60-90
nm) were obtained with a Power Tome XL ultramicrotome diamond
razor and contrasted with uranyl acetate (1%) and lead citrate
(1%). Images were obtained using a Jeol JEM1011 Transmission Electron
Microscope (Tokyo, Japan) at CEML-UFSC, and the relevant events were
recorded in micrographs.
