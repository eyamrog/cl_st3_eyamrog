The literature focused on Brazil has already identified that job
losses were more intense for informal workers – with important
negative effects on equity given the over- representation of more
vulnerable groups in informality – and in industries that are
more contact intensive (Al Masri et al., 2021; Corseuil et
al., 2021; Bridi, 2020). Regarding tele- workability, the report by
Góes et al. (2021) analyzed the composition of the “remote
workforce”, considering different attributes, and identified that it is predominantly
composed of formal-sector workers with complete college education, aged between
30 and 39 years, women and white people.
