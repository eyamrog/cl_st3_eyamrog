From a total of 26 respondents, 46,2% (12) started their
activities in the USR with less than 20 years old,
34,6% (9) between 21 and 24 years old, 15,4% (4)
between 24 and 30 years old and only 3,8% (1)
over 30 years old. Based on these data, considering that
80,5% (21) of the respondents were under 24 years of
age when starting the USR, we can see the realization
of one of the main purposes of the USR, which
is to promote the initiation of young people in the
research activity, as recommended by CNPq in Normative Resolution No.
017 (Brazil, 2006).
