Acetogenins are natural substances that exhibit high antitumor activity, several
orders of magnitude higher than that of some drugs commonly
used in cancer chemotherapy. These compounds are found only in
species of the Annona genus, such as custard apple (Annona
cherimola Mill.), soursop (Annona muricata L.) and sugar apple (Annona
squamosa L.). The phytochemical activity of acetogenins has been demonstrated
in vitro, in animal tests, and in simulations of the
human digestive system (Gutiérrez et al. 2020; León, Pájaro &
Granados 2020; Naik, Dessai & Sellappan 2021; Nayak & Hedge
2021).
