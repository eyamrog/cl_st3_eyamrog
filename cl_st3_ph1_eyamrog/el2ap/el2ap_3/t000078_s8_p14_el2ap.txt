The following two procedures are transformations of the pioneer method
proposed by McDonald (1987). The method considers the residues of
a log density specification of employment. The main contribution offered
by Craig and Ng (2001) is to eliminate the problem
of the discretion of the previous method. The authors use
quantile regression focusing on the 95th percentile of the employment
density distribution. They consider the rings that present high density
and employment, given their knowledge of the city. McMillen's (2001b)
criticizes the estimation of symmetric density function around the CBD
and the a priori researcherâ€™s knowledge of employment distribution in
the city under analysis.
