Pioneer economists from the New Urban Economics developed a theoretical
model in which job supply was concentrated in the Central
Business District (CBD), i.e., a monocentric city. For example, this
central assumption is based on the historical context that the
city center was likely developed near one transportation node. Hence,
results from the monocentric models hypothesize the CBD as a
price- anchor, where the distance from the city center increases
the negative effect on vector prices. Thus, a distance increase
from the CBD can be seen as the transport cost
increasing dually. The modelâ€™s bottom line is that land price
must be compensated by distance increases from the central city
place to balance firms and households in this economy. In
short, the endogenous variables from the model (population density, lot
size, land price, wage, etc.) face an inverse spatial cone
pattern, and they are estimated as a simple function of
the anchor (CBD).
