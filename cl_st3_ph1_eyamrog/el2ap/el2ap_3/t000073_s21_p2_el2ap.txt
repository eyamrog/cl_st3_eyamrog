It is not possible to speak of the most represented
species in terms of distribution since the country lacks extensive
samplings to represent all the ecoregions appropriately. Dring (1973) and
Miller & Miller (1988) estimated a hundred genera of gasteromycetes,
therefore the diversity of this group is still not well
represented in Paraguay, since only 15 genera are recorded in
the literature.
