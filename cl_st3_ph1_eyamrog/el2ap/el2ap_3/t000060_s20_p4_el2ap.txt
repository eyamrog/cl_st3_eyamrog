After reading the defendant’s statements under direct examination, Mr. Martinez
asks her to confirm his comprehension about what really had
happened. Although in everyday conversation, questions and answers are widely
used by participants, the typical adjacency pair “question/answer” can vary
in forensic contexts. Gibbons (2008, p. 119) states that “in
courtroom examination however the atypical social relations mean that the
underlying assumption, subject to certain exceptions, is that the lawyers
and the judge ask the questions, and the witness replies”.
In these settings, “witnesses are usually not permitted to reply
off topic or to refuse to reply (unless a reply
would be self-incriminating)”. We have to take for granted that
many cross-examining lawyers do not ask questions to which they
do not know the answer.
