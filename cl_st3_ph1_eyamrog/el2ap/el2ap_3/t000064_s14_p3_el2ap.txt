Light response curves - For each treatment, two leaves per
plant from five plants (n = 10 measurements) were analyzed.
From each leaf, the curve of light intensity/net carbon absorption
(A, µmol CO2 m-2 s-1) was obtained with a portable
infra-red gas analyzer (IRGA) model LI-6400XT, manufactured by LI-COR Bioscience®.
Since the leaves of the in vitro plantlets and the
recently rooted seedlings were too small to completely fill the
leaf chamber of the IRGA, data were adjusted according to
the leaf area.
