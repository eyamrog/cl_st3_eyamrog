Considering the ecological importance of bromeliads and endemism, it is
of fundamentally important to establish conservation strategies that ensure the
availability of genetic diversity (Costa et al. 2014, BFG 2015).
In this context, available information on ex situ conservation procedures
of bromeliad species in Brazil is still incipient, revealing the
need to establish effective programs for the conservation of native
flora (Rodrigues et al. 2014).
