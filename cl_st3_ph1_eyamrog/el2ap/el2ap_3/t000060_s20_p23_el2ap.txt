In the example above, there are two markers well which
are used to help speakers gain some time to elaborate
their speeches. We also observe the marker you know employed
for purposes of social interaction. These devices are widely used
in spoken language and are responsible for the development of
the conversational turn. By means of the marker you know,
speakers seek interlocutors’ anticipatory discursive approval in order to prevent
themselves from the possibility of possible disagreements. It implicitly induces
the listener to identify with the speaker’s speech or dissuade
those who have a different opinion. It is a measure
taken by the speaker to prevent something unpleasant or inconvenient
from happening.
