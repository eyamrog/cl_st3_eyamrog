Some variables maintained important independent effects after controlling for types
of work fixed effects. We can highlight the positive effects
on the probability of remote work of college education, salaried
employment (other than self-employed or employers) and labor income â€“
indicating that the propensity to remote work varies between occupations
but also within these occupations. Furthermore, everything else kept constant,
younger, female and white workers are somewhat more likely to
work remotely.
