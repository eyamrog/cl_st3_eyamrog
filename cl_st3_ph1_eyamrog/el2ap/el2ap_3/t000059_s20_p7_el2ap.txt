The importance of journal size appeared again when the LILACS
journals were grouped by subject or country of publication. Figure
2 shows the average of each concentration index, by journal
size, for the six countries with at least 20 journals
(out of the 18 countries in the database). Likewise, Figure
3 shows the average of each concentration index, by journal
size, for the six subjects with at least 20 journals
(of the 183 subjects in the database). For each country
and each subject, the proportion of articles by the most
prolific author was lower and the Gini coefficient was higher
for larger journals.
