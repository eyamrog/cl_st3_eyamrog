Is important to notice that the number of species for
Rio Branco and Xapuri can be different that showed here
(Table 2) as one of the articles clustered the results
for both municipalities. So we had to group all species
records (for this specific article) under the same name (Bujari/Rio
Branco/Xapuri) (Table 2). Another issue is regarding Psychodopygus corossoniensis, as
it is the only one for the state and the
author does not provide the municipality where specimens were collected
(the only location reference is “AC Highway Km 22”). Therefore,
the county for this observation is NA.
