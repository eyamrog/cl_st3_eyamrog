Considering selfie behaviors levels (low, mild, moderate and severe) it
was found that people who had low levels of selfie
scored higher on the "environmental enhancement" factor. This factor demonstrates
that people who engage in selfie behaviors feel privileged to
connect to the environment through the selfie to create emotional
memories, and associate the selfie with some environment (e.g. they
always take selfies when they are with friends in some
environment, or when they are in a bar, restaurant, or
any other place, in order to record the moment) (Boursier
& Manna, 2018; Kiprin, 2013).
