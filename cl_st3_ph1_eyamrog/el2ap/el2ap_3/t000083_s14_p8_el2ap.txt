As mentioned earlier, the exploratory factor analysis performed in the
original study detected 6 factors, and of the 20 items,
four items were related to the "environmental enhancement" and the
"social competition" factors and three items in each of the
remaining four factors, attention-seeking, mood modification, subjective conformity and self-confidence.
The original instrument showed satisfactory internal consistencies in each of
the six factors, with overall internal consistency 0.876 (Balakrishnan and
Griffiths, 2017).
