Employment decentralization from within the city is one of the
changes which foster urban landscape modification, influence wages, housing prices,
transportation demands, and worker commuting (Fujita and Ogawa, 1982; Anas
and Kim, 1990; Helsley and Sullivan, 1991). The decentralization of
employment stems from the suburbanization process (Glaser and Kahn, 2001).
Such a process, where economic growth sprawls from the CBD
towards the cityâ€™s edge, utilizes comparative advantages in transportation costs,
wages, and land prices (McMillen and Smith, 2003). McMillen (2001b)
points out that city growth is a mechanism that promotes
a large employment concentration outside of the CBD. This city
pattern is typical in big American cities, where suburbs have
families, offices, and employment. In some cities, the suburbs aggregate
more workers than in the center (McMillen, 2001a). Notably, these
new sub-centralities have a meaningful impact on the city structure.
Urban Economics literature refers to these new employment clusters as
employment subcenters or Small Business Districts (SBD).
