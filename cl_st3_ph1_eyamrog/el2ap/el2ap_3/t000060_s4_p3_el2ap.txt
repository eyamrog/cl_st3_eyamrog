As observed in our corpus, mitigation devices contributed to preserve
the self-image constructed by speakers as well as to produce
certain meaning effects on listeners. The hedge technically and markers
such as I think, I don’t think, and I don’t
believe collaborated to neutralize possible contrary reactions or negative interpretations
from interlocutors; they lessen the impact of speakers’ utterances and
decisions by distancing their image from divergent judgments or opinions,
therefore protecting their positive face. When the Judge sustained the
objections claimed by the deputy county attorney, for instance, she
chose to employ politeness strategies with the defense lawyer. To
reduce the force of an imperative form, she used “why
don’t you restate” in: “why don’t you just restate the
question that you technically asked her”, which functions as a
polite request that plays down its face threat.
