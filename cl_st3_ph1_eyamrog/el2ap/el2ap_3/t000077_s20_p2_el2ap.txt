The pandemic created the need for different remote work regimes
for a large part of the employed population in Brazil
and the ability to remain working under these circumstances depended
on the occupation. Therefore, considering that the type of task
performed at work is an essential determinant of the possibility
of remote work, the analysis of the results starts from
this characterization. Figure 1 shows the share of workers who
worked from home by categories of types of work, position,
or function.
