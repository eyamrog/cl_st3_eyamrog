The Mini-disk infiltrometer is a two-chamber device in which the
Mariotte principle is applied to control soil suction. Such equipment
uses the analytical solution proposed by Zhang (1997). Similar to
Ghimire et al. (2013), to increase the contact area between
the infiltrometer and the soil, we carried out two steps:
(i) we carefully removed the litter layer and (ii) we
used a thin (< 1 mm) of fine sand. These
procedures ensure optimum contact between the infiltrometer and the soil.
To capture the highest range of pores, we set a
suction pressure of 0 cm which corresponds to Ko, that
is, the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Reichardt & Timm 2019). The
rates of water discharge through the Mini-Disk, as inferred from
changes in the water levels in the storage chamber, were
recorded until steady-state flow was reached. Infiltration was measured using
three linear transects randomly distributed within the riparian forest (figure
2). To randomize linear transects, we used a randomizer software
(randomizer.org) which selected 3 out of 50 grid transects. Ten
infiltration samples were taken from each of these transects. Transects
were established in parallel to stream channel. When measuring infiltration,
it is important to minimize the effect of soil moisture
on infiltration measurements since substantial variation can occur from one
month to the next (see Pereira et al. 2021). Thus,
we carried out two steps: (i) measurements were made in
August (dry season) when soil moisture in the region is
minimal (Oliveira et al. 2005), and (ii) we set 0
cm of suction pressure in the Mariotte bottle.
