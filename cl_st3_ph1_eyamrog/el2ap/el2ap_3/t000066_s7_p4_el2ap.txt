In Brazil, this happened with group Brincadas2, an initiative that
the LACE Research Group3 decided to launch when the researcher
group leader, Fernanda Liberali, joined the GPB. Soon after, Brincadas
became a Brazilian community that both offered support to educators,
principals, coordinators, parents, and students in school contexts and provided
food, medicine, and conversation to people in need. The group
also provided other intervention services through national campaigns and international
sponsors, such as donating masks and other personal protective clothing
and equipment to health professionals, who had to fight covid-19,
but did not have enough support from the government at
that time.
