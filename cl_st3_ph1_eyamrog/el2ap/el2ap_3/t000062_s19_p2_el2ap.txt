The greatest richness was found in Theridiidae with five species,
followed by Corinnidae and Linyphiidae, both with three species. Of
the 20 species identified, only two were more abundant: Ianduba
varia (Keyserling, 1891) with six individuals (17.14% of the total
adults) and Agyneta sp. with five (14.28%). All other species
had only one or two individuals each (table 1).
