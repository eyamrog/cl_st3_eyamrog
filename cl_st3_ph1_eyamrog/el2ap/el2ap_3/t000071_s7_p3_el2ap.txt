First of all, our findings bear directly on the reputation
of PKP’s software and those who employ it for their
journals, as well as on the reason for this open
source software project, which is to support open access to
research as a human right and provide a means of
improving this body of work. The data from the OJS
journals used in this analysis have been made available for
purposes of reproducibility and further studies, as a check on
possible bias (Khanna et al., 2021). A second conflict of
interest is rooted in how open source software projects, such
as OJS, are generally committed to respecting users’ “freedom to
run the program for any purpose,” to cite a common
open source software definition (Wheeler, n.d.).5 Yet rather than taking
the typical open source “hands-off” approach to software’s users, we
are prepared to intervene out of a responsibility to assess
and affect where OJS fits into the “predatory” picture. Our
goal is to better understand the role that open source
software and open infrastructure platform developers can play in addressing
this issue.
