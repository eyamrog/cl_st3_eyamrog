The design of two of the largest learner corpora compiled
in the 1990s (Granger, 1998) are worth mentioning: the International
Corpus of Learner English (ICLE) and the Longman Learners’ Corpus
(LLC), especially due to how they have dealt with language,
task and learner-related features (Tono, 2003). Language-related features are mode,
genre, style and topic. These corpora encompass texts in the
written mode with slight differences in the other features: mostly
argumentative essays on a previously defined list of topics in
ICLE and essays and exam scripts on a variety of
topics in LLC. Task-related characteristics concern (a) data collection: sectional
rather than longitudinal, (b) type of elicitation: spontaneous as contrasted
to prepared or edited texts, (c) production time: either fixed
or timed or untimed and done as homework, and (d)
use of references allowed, for instance, dictionaries, with such information
recorded. As for learner- related features, ICLE is a corpus
with texts produced by university level students, while LLC allows
for participation of different academic level groups. Both corpora have
texts written by learners from a variety of first language
backgrounds. While ICLE has high-intermediate to advanced material, LCC allows
for the submission of texts at all levels. ICLE was
“the first large collection of computerized learner data to be
made available for research” while LLC “has been commercially available
for research” (Tono, 2003, p. 800). Whereas ICLE has recently
released a new version presenting over 5.5 million words (Granger
et al., 2020); LLC, with 10 million words (Tono, 2003)
does not have such updated information on their website.13
