Yasenov (2020) analyzed the US labor market and found that
lower paid workers are up to three times less likely
to be able to work from their homes; as a
result, remote work is less possible for the least educated,
the youngest, the ethnic minorities and immigrants. Also for the
United States, the results of Bartik et al. (2020) corroborate
that remote work is much more common in industries with
better educated and better-paid workers.
