The concept of mimesis, in its etymological origin, is centered
on the ideas of imitation and representation (Gebauer and Wulf,
2004). The idea of learning by imitation, linked or not
to the concept of mimesis, is the subject of several
researches and authors in different areas of CHS, and it
is possible to state that there is an inseparable relationship
between imitation and education in Western culture (Carvalho, 2019). Christoph
Wulf (2016) state that the human being child or adult,
learns to act in society mainly in a mimetic way.
This learning often takes place through participation in rites and
rituals in which knowledge is passed on in an incorporated
way into action.
