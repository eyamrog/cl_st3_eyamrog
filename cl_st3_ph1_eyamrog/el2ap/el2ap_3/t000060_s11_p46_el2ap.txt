Every person lives in a world of social encounters that
involves contacts with others. In each of these contacts, people
tend to externalize their opinions, judgments and points of view
that lead them to act out what is called a
line, that is, “a pattern of verbal and nonverbal acts
by which he expresses his view of the situation and
through this his evaluation of the participants, especially himself” (Goffman,
1974, p. 9). The individual hence expresses an evaluation of
participants and, above all, of himself, so that his line
presents a view of self. In addition, this line has
to be in accordance with the way he wants to
be seen.
