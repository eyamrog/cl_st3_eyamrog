In the second activity, called What’s true about me, facilitators
wanted all the participants − not only the guests −
to have a chance to share information about themselves. To
this end, all participants were instructed to cover their cameras
and listen to a general fact about one of them,
such as What’s true about me is that I like
to wake up late. Those to whom the information was
true had to uncover their cameras, so they would be
able to see who shared something in common with them.
After a few rounds, participants felt more confident to connect
to one another through their differences and similarities.
