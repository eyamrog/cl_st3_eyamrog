Adolescents and young adults post selfies on social media in
search of popularity, recognition, and appreciation (McLean et al., 2019).
In a study conducted by Chua & Chang (2016), adolescents
described that peer recognition was the greatest motivation for sharing
selfies, indicating that the amount and valence of feedback play
a predominant role in self-esteem and feelings of acceptance. On
the other hand, when a post does not receive the
desired amount of "likes" or comments, it can result in
impoverished feelings of well-being (Jong & Drummond, 2016). Young people's
recognition of social media photo sharing and feelings of well-being
highlights selfie practices as an important area of research. Increasing
understanding about these effects on adolescents is particularly important, as
adolescence is a significant period of identity development, self-image, and
social interactions, all of which are likely to be impacted
by selfie practices.
