Several researchers (e.g., Cashion, 1985; Harris, 2003) have focused on
the connection between politeness and power and have come to
the same conclusion. Surprisingly, those participants who hold the most
powerful roles tend to use politeness strategies abundantly to redress
the face-threatening acts that they have to perform. But these
participants can also choose not to use politeness strategies in
case they need to explicitly show their power. According to
Harris (2003, p. 33), it is negative politeness features that
are especially relevant to institutional settings (i.e., those strategies that
prevent imposing on the speaker or impeding them). The counsels
in Cashion’s study (1985, p. 13) were found to exhibit
mostly negative politeness features whereas positive politeness strategies (strategies that
attend to the speaker’s needs to be liked) occurred only
rarely. In his cross-examination, Rampton employs a negative politeness strategy
‘correct me if I’m wrong’ to avoid imposing his knowledge
on the witness.
