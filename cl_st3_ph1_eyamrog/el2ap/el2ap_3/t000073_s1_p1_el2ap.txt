(A first review of Gasteroid fungi (Agaricomycetes, Basidiomycota) in Paraguay).
Based on the available literature, a list of 40 gasteroid
species recorded in Paraguay since the earliest known collection is
presented. A total of forty species are reported, distributed among
16 genera and 4 families. This work represents the first
compilation of data available on this group of fungi for
Paraguay. These numbers reveal the scarce amount of species formally
cited for the Paraguayan Funga.
