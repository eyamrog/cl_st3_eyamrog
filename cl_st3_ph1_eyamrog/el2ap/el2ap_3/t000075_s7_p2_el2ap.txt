In the other hand, it is also widely recognized that
mainstream economics did not share such interpretation back in the
1970s and 1980s, period in which the supposed benefits of
free mobility of capital stood out. However, the mainstream approach
on financial openness and capital controls has been changing considerably
over the last two- and-a-half decades for several reasons. The
orthodox presumptions that theoretically grounded the financial openness processes in
the 1980s and 1990s were contradicted by the crises that
hit emerging economies in the late 1990s. In addition, the
global financial crisis that broke out in 2008 introduced another
important shift in these mainstream studies, which were also boosted
by the use of capital controls by several emerging countries
in the post-crisis period. In this perspective, in the past
few years the emerging mainstream literature is characterized by: i)
new recommendations on regulatory measures on capital flows; ii) studies
that empirically investigate the effectiveness of capital controls and macroprudential
policies; and iii) new orthodox models that ground the use
of capital controls. Unlikely two decades ago, in which the
mainstream advocated free capital movement, the new empirical studies and
theoretical models suggest that countries – especially emerging economies –
can use capital controls to ensure financial stability, monetary policy
autonomy, and even greater rates of economic growth.
