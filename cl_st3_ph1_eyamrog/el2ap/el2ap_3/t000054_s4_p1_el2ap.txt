Latin America hosts an important part of the Earth's biodiversity,
closely linked to the existence of still unexplored regions and
the presence of aboriginal communities that have not been contacted.
The indigenous traditions of respect for nature and harmonious coexistence
with it determine that this biodiversity is closely associated with
cultural practices of different types.
