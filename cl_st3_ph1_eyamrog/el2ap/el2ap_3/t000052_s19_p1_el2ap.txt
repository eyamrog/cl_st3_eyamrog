The identification of host species was confirmed by the molecular
analysis, and the sequences were deposited in Genbank (Identification number
XXX). Gills of eleven Auchenoglanis occidentalis specimens were examined for
parasite infection. Seven out of eleven hosts were found be
parasitized. The most parasitized fish host is the sole specimen
caught at the Mouth of Mutambala River.
