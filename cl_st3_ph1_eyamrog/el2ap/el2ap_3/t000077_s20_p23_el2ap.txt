The positive effect of hourly earnings on the probability of
remote work was also maintained in column (4); therefore, for
similar workers, the higher the income, the greater the chance
of being able to work from home. And the effect
that remained the highest in the column (4) model was
that of college education. A worker with college education has
an increase of 11.78 p.p. on the probability of doing
remote work, compared to the worker with no education. This
effect fell by almost half when controlling for labor activities,
indicating that the greater participation in remote work for workers
with higher education also reflect the occupation selection in the
labor market. According to Gaudecker et al. (2020), the important
role of education after controlling income may indicate that the
possibility of working from home is driven mainly by the
composition of tasks rather than the availability of home office
resources.
