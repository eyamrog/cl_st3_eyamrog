Finally, there is a latent discourse of inner-EU discipline, at
the level of the proximal not-yet-spoken, observable in the judgement
that preserving the “Geschlossenheit” (‘unity’, the official translation has the
more military term “united front”) is an opportunity, and in
the dialogically contractive pronouncement of a demand that unity means
that member states not simply ask what they can extract
in Brussels for their own country, but ask what the
best decision for “our” Union is. This discourse is connected
to the watershed discourse (“die Zeitenwende […] trifft ganz Europa”,
‘the watershed affects all of Europe’), suggesting that the new
reality German politicians are discursively constructing is envisaged for all
of Europe.
