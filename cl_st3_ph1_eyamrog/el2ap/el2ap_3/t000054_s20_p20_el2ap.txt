The frog Epipedobates anthonyi is endemic to Peru, Colombia, and
Ecuador; on its skin there is a powerful poison that
has earned it its name and that drew the attention
of science starting in the 1970s. At that time, the
chemist John Daly, of the US National Institute of Health,
collected skins of this amphibian in Ecuador, which possibly left
the country through diplomatic channels, since there is no evidence
that the Ecuadorian Institute of Forestry and Natural Areas (INEFAN,
later merged into the Ministry of Environment) has granted a
license for the operation (GRAIN 1998). Laboratory studies led to
the synthesis of a non-opioid alkaloid (epibatidine) of pharmaceutical interest.
