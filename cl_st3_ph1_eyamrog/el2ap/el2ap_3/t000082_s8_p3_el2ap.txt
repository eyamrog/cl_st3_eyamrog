Antagonisms and mutualisms are not isolated in nature but coexist
in a variety of ways. Studies have explored the effects
of combining mutualisms and antagonisms on population dynamics (e.g., Melián
et al. 2009), community stability (e.g., Wilson et al. 2003),
and network structure (e.g., Genini et al. 2010), highlighting the
importance of considering the multiple outcomes that interactions may have
at a single community and assigning the extremes of a
gradient between mutualism and antagonism (Fontaine et al. 2011, Rodríguez-Rodríguez
et al. 2017). Individuals of the same species can function
as antagonists or mutualistic partners of the same interacting species,
e.g., seed-caching rodents acting as seed predators and seed dispersers
of the same plant species (Loayza et al. 2014). In
other scenarios, individuals may act as antagonisms of some species
and as mutualisms of others (Gómez et al. 2018, Gómez
et al. 2014, Montesinos-Navarro et al. 2017). Finally, there are
species in which individuals are specialized cheaters, exploring mutualistic interactions
without providing any benefit in return like fig wasps and
yucca moths (Bronstein 2001). Thus, in mutualistic interactions, selection may
favor the evolution of life histories that exploit the resources
and services provided by mutualistic partners without providing benefits, hereafter,
cheating interactions (Bronstein 2001, Vieira et al. 2003).
