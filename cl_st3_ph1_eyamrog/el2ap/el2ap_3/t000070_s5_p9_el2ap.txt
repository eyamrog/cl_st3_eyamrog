It was observed, in the present study, that cryopreserved seeds,
when compared to those non- cryopreserved, do not show structural
or biochemical differences, thus, corroborating that cryopreservation did not affect
the seeds. Seen in these terms, non-reducing sugars, sucrose, and
some oligosaccharides are important for the protection of membranes against
the formation of crystals at the moment of freezing, as
well as the accumulation of lipid bodies and starch grains
(Zaritzky 2015). In embryonic corn cells, protein bodies were also
observed (Wen 2009), while in the embryonic cells of Livistona
chinensis (Jacq.) R.Br. ex Mart., the accumulation of these substances
was not detected, probably because they are considered recalcitrant seeds
(Wen 2010). Therefore, it was observed, concerning the present study,
that the seeds of V. reitzii have reserve organelles in
the form of lipid bodies, protein bodies, and orthamyloplasts, which
can confer tolerance to desiccation and cooling and also reaffirm
the orthodox behaviour of the seeds.
