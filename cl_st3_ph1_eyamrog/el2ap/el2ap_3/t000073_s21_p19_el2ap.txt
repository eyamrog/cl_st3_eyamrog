Identification. Bates et al. (2009) reported Calvatia lilacina as a
synonym of Calvatia fragilis in Arizona, USA. On the other
hand both species are treated as independent by Trierveiler-Pereira &
Baseia (2009) in Brazil. Cortez et al. (2012) consider this
species a synonym of C. cyathiformis but other authors differ
and consider C. cyathiformis as a different species (Verma et
al. 2018).
