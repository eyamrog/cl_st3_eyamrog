As a starting point for the estimation of the Hedonic
Price Model, it is considered that the OLS estimation, used
in Equation 1, contains the following restrictions for the spatial
parameters 𝜌= 𝜆= 𝜅𝑜= 𝜏𝑝= 0. This estimation allows for
evaluating if control variables can solve the possible spatial dependence
pointed out in the literature, permitting to assess if the
price gradient decreases due to the distance from the CBD.
