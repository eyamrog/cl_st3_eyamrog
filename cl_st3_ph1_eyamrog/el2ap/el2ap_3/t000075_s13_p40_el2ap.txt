Since the results above refer especially to sporadic CFMs, some
other studies that analyze permanent versus sporadic capital controls provide
a measure of their relative effectiveness. Permanent capital controls were
superior to sporadic capital controls in boosting economic growth and
reducing financial risks. Permanent capital controls also showed a stronger
co-movement between the different classes of assets/debts subject to controls,
indicating a higher effectiveness in avoiding evasion. Klein (2012) and
Fern√°ndez et al. (2016) conduct the main studies from which
one can draw this conclusion.
