This checklist has been compiled based on literature records of
gasteroid fungi recorded from Paraguay. The information retrieved from the
literature includes distribution records per department (figure 1), notes about
habitat and substrate, and detailed descriptions and remarks of the
basidiomata. The current taxonomic position is indicated, as have been
described in previous publications and a brief introduction of the
most outstanding characteristics of each species is provided. The classification
and nomenclature followed the database Mycobank (http://www.mycobank.org). Genera and species
are listed alphabetically (table 1) and the authorities for the
binomials, as well as the author names and spellings, are
in accordance to Robert et al. (2005) database.
