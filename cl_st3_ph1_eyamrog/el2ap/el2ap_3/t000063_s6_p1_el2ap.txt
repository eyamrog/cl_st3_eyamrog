As of mid-2021, almost all 14-19 year olds that responded
the anonymous questionnaire had a favorable perception of science (91%)
being “knowledge” the main word associated with it. Also, 7
out of 10 adolescents stated that their experience during the
COVID-19 pandemic improved their opinion of science, scientists and health
care workers while only 8% and 4% worsened their perception
of science and of scientists and health care workers, respectively.
It is interesting to note that more adolescents improved both
their perception of scientists and health care workers as a
result of the pandemic (58%) than those who worsened their
perception of both professionals (1%).
