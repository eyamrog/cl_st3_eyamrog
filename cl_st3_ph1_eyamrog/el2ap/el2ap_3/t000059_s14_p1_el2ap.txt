This bibliographic study covered LILACS from years 2015 to 2019,
and included journals with at least 50 articles with at
least one identified individual author (“signed articles”). In January 2022,
the iAH (Interface for Access on Health Information) search interface
in the BIREME’s Virtual Health Library was used to search
for any documents indexed as journal articles in that study
period. In May 2022, BIREME provided a database listing journal
data such as (abbreviated) journal title, LILACS indexing, and subjects
(described as Health Sciences Descriptors – DeCS). All data were
downloaded in the ISO 2709 format, imported into the R
statistical environment 4.2.1 (R Core Team 2022) with its package
stringi 1.7.8 (Gagolewski 2022) and code written for this purpose
(Fontenelle 2022), and then filtered to include only signed articles
from systematically indexed journals with at least 50 of those.
