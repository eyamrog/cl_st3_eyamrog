Mainstream media, decision makers and the general public increased their
interest towards science understanding and engagement to take better decisions
and lower the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Since the beginning
of the pandemic, society showed great admiration and gratitude to
both health care personnel and the scientific community for their
dedicated work in managing and solving this health crisis (6).
Life-transforming events such as a pandemic can dramatically impact young
adults’ attitudes (7). The 1969 arrival of mankind to the
Moon inspired a generation of youngsters to pursue careers in
science (4). Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many
countries and organizations have reported an increase in public confidence
and interest towards science and an increase in applications for
scientific and medical studies, an effect popularized as the “Fauci
effect”(8, 9, 10, 11, 12).
