The emerging economies that triggered the CFMs had mainly six
goals: i) to counter an appreciation of the exchange rate,
ii) to raise the degree of monetary policy autonomy, iii)
to stretch the maturity of external liabilities, iv) to reduce
the net volume of financial inflows, v) to counter credit
booms, and vi) to counter asset inflation (Habermeier et al.,
2011). Capital controls, however, are not due only to their
effects on the economies that use them. Other studies point
out the spillover effects of CFMs. To investigate the effectiveness
of capital controls imposed by emerging economies, Habermeier et al.
(2011) estimate VAR regressions6 which results point to the relative
effectiveness of raising the degree of monetary policy autonomy for
Brazil, Thailand, and Colombia, as well stretching the maturity of
external liabilities of the latter.
