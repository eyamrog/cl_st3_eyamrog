The results derived from the estimation of Equation 1 (controlling
for SBD) by OLS (Table 4, columns 5-8) are supported
by the urban theoretical models (decreasing gradient price) - for
both functional forms and specifications of the CBD variable. However,
tests on spatial randomness reject the null hypothesis. Due to
spatial dependence, the signals and tests may be inaccurate. Therefore,
to overcome the OLS estimator limitation, we estimate the econometric
model by the SLX estimator.
