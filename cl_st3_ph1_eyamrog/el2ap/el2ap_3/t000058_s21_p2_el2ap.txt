Climatic alterations with constant modifications in the environment over time
promote significant changes in biodiversity, above all in the insect
population, where one can observe a greater dispersion in the
environment, mainly of those species of medical/epidemiological interest. The data
made available in this work could be fundamental in future
studies on aspects regarding ecology, the environment and biodiversity, principally
of the species of medical interest from the perspective of
“One Health”. An important point concerning the current collection is
that it represents 18 new first recorded samples of species
for the state of Paraná, serving as an important reference
for research into the biodiversity of mosquitoes. This demonstrates and
reaffirms the importance of maintaining and constantly updating biological collections.
