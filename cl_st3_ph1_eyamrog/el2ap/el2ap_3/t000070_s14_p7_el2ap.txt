Representative samples of the seeds were fixed in paraformaldehyde solution
in phosphate buffer (2.5%) 0.2M pH 7.2 for 72 hours
at 4 °C, for anatomical analysis. The dehydration was in
an increasing ethyl series (0-100 °Gl), and soon after the
samples were pre-infiltrated in a solution of ethanol (100%) and
historesin glycol methacrylate (GMA) (1:1 v v) for 6 hours,
infiltrated in Historesin (Leica Historesin, Heidelberg, Germany) and arranged in
histo-molds at 35 °C in an oven for 24 hours.
