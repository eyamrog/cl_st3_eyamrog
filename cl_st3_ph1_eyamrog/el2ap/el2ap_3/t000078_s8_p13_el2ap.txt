McDonald (1987) firstly proposed the cut-off method, applying for the
Chicago metropolitan area, and Guiliano and Small (1991) extend the
empirical approach, identifying 32 SBD in Los Angeles, United States.
Under their method, a sub-center is a set of contiguous
areas that have a minimum density of ten employees per
acre and hold 10,000 employees. These models received several criticisms
due to the discretion of the chosen locations, the sensitivity
of the results to the cut-off, and the impossibility of
generalization to any other city (Anas et al., 1998; McMillen,
2001b; Baumont et al., 2004).
