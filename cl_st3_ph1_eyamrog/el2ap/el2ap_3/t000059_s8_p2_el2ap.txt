Recently, a high-profile scandal involving editors affiliated to the same
institution as the authors motivated Locher and colleagues (2021 Mar
30) to propose an authorship concentration index (proportion of articles
by the most prolific author) as an indicator of endogeneity.
A second index (the Gini coefficient of inequality) was soon
proposed by Scanff and colleagues (2021), who validated both indexes
in a representative sample of journals indexed in MEDLINE. When
either index was above its 95th percentile, the journal’s most
prolific author was more likely than not to participate in
the journal’s editorial board. Furthermore, the most prolific authors were
more likely to have their articles accepted in less than
three weeks, and this publication lag was even shorter in
journals with a larger number of articles by their most
prolific author. As discussed by Scanff and colleagues (2021), while
there are legitimate reasons for editors to publish in their
own journals, and for articles from prolific authors to have
shorter evaluation times, both authorship concentration indexes can be used
for flagging journals as potentially endogenous, “self-promotion journals” (as in
Locher and colleagues (2021 Mar 30)), or “nepotistic journals” (as
in Scanff and colleagues (2021)).
