The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic required individuals to look for information
to increase their safety, and to use terms previously only
common in academic contexts and used by audiences interested in
science and medicine. Since the beginning of the pandemic, platforms
like Google reported an increase in the search tendency of
words related to the detection, symptoms, transmission, treatment and prevention
of COVID-19 (1). Social media platforms like Twitter reported having
“coronavirus”, “covid”, and “pandemic” as trending topics, while “quarantine” was
mentioned 1.6 million times in 2020. Experts, both form scientific
and medical fields used social media platforms to share technical
information in real time with peers while also informing the
general public (2,3). Few worldwide events in modern history have
put science and health sciences on center stage as much
as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which by December 2021 had
over 5 million confirmed deaths around the globe (4,5).
