By facing the world the pandemic created, the GPB community
stands up for global collaboration in its multiple facets. The
workshops, as the one focused here, try to engage participants
in social transformation through affectus (Spinoza, 2017) generated in play
and talk sessions. They seek to conceive new realities by
means of discussion as well as a range of creative
means, such as imagination, improvisation, and performance. It is a
movement to fight against those forces that push back the
possibility of coexistence, which is, after all, the combination of
everything that constitutes the self and what enables us to
be.
