This is the longest section in the speech. Here, Scholz
connects the previously introduced watershed and Putin’s war discourses to
claim that Putin “will ein russisches Imperium errichten” (‘wants to
build a Russian empire’). This claim is supported by a
strategy of acknowledgement through negative appreciation of Putin’s voice, as
manifested in his “historisierende Abhandlungen” (‘historicising essays’), televised declaration of
war and personal talks Scholz has had with him. This
voice is then represented through the dialogically contractive pronouncement “kann
keinen Zweifel mehr haben” (‘can no longer have any doubt’)
as allowing only one conclusion, which is the one Scholz
has drawn. The validity of his conclusion is further alleged
by the dialogically contractive endorsement “Das sehen wir heute in
der Ukraine” (‘We can see that today in Ukraine’) and
when he makes the judgement “schreckt er nicht zurück vor
militärischer Gewalt” (‘has no qualms about using military force’).
