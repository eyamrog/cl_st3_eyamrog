There is a space that the development of the Latin
American economy can occupy, and it is a paradox that
the main resources to do so are found precisely in
biodiversity, which, on the other hand, is essential to preserve.
The central idea for this projection is based on the
bioeconomy, which is centered on the efficient use of biological
and natural resources and the recycling of their waste; its
use has among its advantages the reduction of the use
of energy provided by fossil fuels and the reduction of
carbon emissions (Hodson, Henry & Trigo 2019).
