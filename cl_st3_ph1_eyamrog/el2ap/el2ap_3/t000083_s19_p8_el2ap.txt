The MANOVA indicated that the factors differ across the four
selfitis's intensity levels (low, mild, moderate, severe) with the following
rates: Wilks’ l= 0.421; f=39.32 (15.981); p<0.001). The average results
concerning the mean difference of the individual factors at the
intensity level (ANOVA) are shown in Table 4. The effect
size was calculated with the partial eta-squared test (ɳ2) which
showed moderate to large level of significance (Cohen, 1988). Among
the factors, "attention seeking" was identified to differ widely across
the four levels of selfie intensity, followed by "social competition,"
"mood and confidence," "subjective conformity" and "environmental enhancement" factors.
