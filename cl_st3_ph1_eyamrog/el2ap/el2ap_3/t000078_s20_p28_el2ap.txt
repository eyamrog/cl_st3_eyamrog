The Morumbi district starts to present the statistically significant coefficient
with the sign expected from the theoretical models after increasing
the distance cut-off by 10%. However, the coefficient of region
A7 ceases to be statistically significant, although the signals remain
as expected. It should be noted that the coefficients that
estimate the commuting effect concerning the areas A4, A28, and
A32 are statistically significant for both specifications of the spatial
weight matrices.
