[in USR,] learning takes place through observation and imitation of
what the most experienced people do. In the field work,
an intern informed me that she could only succeed in
a certain procedure because the employee had taught her a
special way to hold the scissors and that without it
she would not be able to advance. Tacit knowledge thus
accounts for a large part of the work in science,
forcing those who wish to continue in the scientific endeavor
to spend a good deal of time in the laboratories.
