The vascular bundles were heavily fibrous with two strands of
phloem placed laterally to the xylem (figures 6 a, e-f).
However, this feature was less pronounced in leaves from in
vitro plants (figure 6 d). The vascular fibres had thick
lignified cell walls (figures 6 a, e-f). The vascular fibres
were present in a greater amount in the control plants,
in an intermediate amount in the greenhouse plants and in
a small amount in the in vitro plants (figures 6
a, e-f).
