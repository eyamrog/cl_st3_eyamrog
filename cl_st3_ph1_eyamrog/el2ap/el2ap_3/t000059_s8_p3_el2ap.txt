As noted by Scanff and colleagues (2021), about one third
of the journals suspected of endogeneity were published in at
least one language other than English, even if MEDLINE is
skewed towards journals in English. This skewness also means the
proposed 95th cutoffs may not generalize to health sciences journals
in other languages, which are often not indexed in MEDLINE.
Such journals are more likely to be included in the
World Health Organization’s Global Index Medicus, which comprises five regional
bibliographic indexes targeting low- and middle-income countries. The first and
foremost of such regional indexes is the Latin American and
the Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS), which is maintained
by the Pan American Health Organization’s Latin American and Caribbean
Center on Health Sciences Information (BIREME, from its original name
in Portuguese) (Clark and Castro 2002).
