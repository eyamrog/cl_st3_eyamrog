During the post-global crisis period, in which several emerging economies
imposed capital inflow controls, many economists examined their potential effectiveness
in the context of high global liquidity and the concerning
possibility that these CFMs could form a new ‘impoverish the
neighborhood’ policy. Among these economists, Pasricha et al. (2018) contributed
greatly to the literature on capital controls and macroprudential policies.
The authors use a capital controls database to analyze the
effectiveness of the capital controls imposed by emerging economies before
and after the financial crises in terms of financial fluxes,
exchange rate variation, and monetary policy autonomy. The authors examine
two models to analyze the domestic impacts of the capital
controls and the spillover effects of the imposition of controls
by some BRICS members on other emerging economies.
