Regardless of whether an individual intends to take a line,
he will think that he has effectively done so (cf.
Goffman, 1974). “The other participants will assume that he has
more or less wilfully taken a stand, so that if
he is to deal with their response to him, he
must take into consideration the impression they have possibly formed
of him” (Goffman, 1974, p. 9).
