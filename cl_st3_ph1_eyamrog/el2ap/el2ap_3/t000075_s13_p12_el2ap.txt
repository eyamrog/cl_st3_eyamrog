Facing capital flow volatility in the last years, several economists
began inquiring into the presumptions and theories that advocate the
free mobility of capital. One of the more important examples
is the denial of the validity of the macroeconomic trilemma
(or impossible trinity) for emerging economies, as in Rey (2015).
Based on econometric regressions, the author concludes that cross-border financial
fluxes through banking institutions (the financial credits) cause deviations in
emerging economies’ interest rates uncovered parity, despite the exchange rate
regime and the macroeconomic fundaments of these countries. With these
results, only the use of capital controls can raise an
emerging economy’s degree of monetary policy autonomy, such that CFMs
must fall on financial credit and debt bonds fluxes. Additionally,
these regulatory measures should be imposed during booms of financial
inflows and relaxed during a bust (Rey, 2015).
