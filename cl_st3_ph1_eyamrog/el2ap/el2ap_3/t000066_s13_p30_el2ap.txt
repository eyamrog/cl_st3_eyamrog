“Life here changed a lot since March. I don’t feel
totally comfortable… going out and everything. We had such a
hard time in New York, but I guess we could
handle the situation a little bit better. We took it
seriously, and we could flat the curve… My English classes
were online like everywhere. It was a little bit difficult
because I like the interaction with teachers and friends at
classroom, I like to talk, and it was a little
bit lonely because I couldn’t talk to anyone, but I
didn’t have another choice. But life is getting back on
track little by little, you know… and things will be
better. I hope.”
