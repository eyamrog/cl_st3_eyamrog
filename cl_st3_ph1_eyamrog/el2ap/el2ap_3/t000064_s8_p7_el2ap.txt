There have been many reports on the anatomy of Velloziaceae
species (Ayensu 1968, 1969, 1974; Menezes 1977, 1988; Coetzee 1974;
Ayensu & Skvarla 1974; Menezes & Semir 1991; Amaral &
Mello-Silva 2008; Mello-Silva 2010), including V. squamata (Ayensu 1974, Menezes
1977). However, none of which described the leaf anatomy of
micropropagated plants either anatomical responses to shading for those species.
In addition, there is no anatomical report of Vellozia species
grown in vitro at all. Therefore, the present paper aims
to verify the impact of the conditions of in vitro
micropropagation in the photosynthetic responses and in the leaf anatomical
structure of V. squamata.
