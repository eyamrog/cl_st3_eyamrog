An implication for practice is that journal evaluations, both internal
and external, should always mind the journal size when interpreting
the authorship concentration indexes. While a journal publishing a thousand
articles can be expected to have its most prolific author
signing only 1% of them (ten articles), journals publishing fifty
articles have a lower bound of at least 2% for
even the least prolific authors. Likewise, larger journals can attend
to larger and more heterogeneous scientific communities than smaller journals,
and the Gini coefficient (or any other inequality measurement, really)
for aggregate populations is larger than the Gini coefficient of
their sub-populations, if thereâ€™s any inequality among said sub- populations
(Pyatt 1976).
