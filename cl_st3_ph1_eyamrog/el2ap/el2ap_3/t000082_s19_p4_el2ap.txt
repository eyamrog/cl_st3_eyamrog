Our results do not support the prediction that highly connected
species would have a stronger effect on trait evolution in
mutualistic networks (Table 3). In fact, there is high variability
in mean trait disparity within scenarios and types of interactions
across simulations shown by the 0.05 and 0.95 quantiles from
our simulation results represented by the vertical bars in Fig.
3a-b. Thus, highly connected cheaters species do not promote higher
levels of trait diversity than those promoted by cheating interactions
distributed across the network in our simulations (Fig. 3a). Similarly,
the number of trait clusters of species between scenarios are
also variable (Fig. 3b).
