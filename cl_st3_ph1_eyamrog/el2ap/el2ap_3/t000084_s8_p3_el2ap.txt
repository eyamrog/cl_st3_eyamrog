As Paiva (2016) points out, informal written language is becoming
increasingly multimodal. For Paiva, who identified and analyzed emojis in
social media, the use of emojis can be understood as
an attempt to convey meaning economically in certain interactions. The
creation of emojis, associated with mobile applications and their emoji
keyboards, has transformed the way we communicate and interact onTwitter,
WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, and other social media platforms. There is
a growing body of research that is focused on interpreting
the uses of emojis in all forms of digital communication
modes. Researchers have found that even though many emoji’s look
similar, their meaning and interpretation are influenced by individuals' cultural
backgrounds, gender differences, and their own visual characteristics create a
language for communication (Bai, Dan, Mu, & Yang, 2019). Fullwood,
Orchard, and Floyd (2013) conducted extensive research on emoji use
in Internet chat rooms. They found that all age groups
use emoticons for expressing emotions in communication. Their research looked
at specific use of emoji’s based on gender. They found
female participants were more likely to use expressive emoticons more
often than male participants and overall were more likely to
use emoticons during direct interactions with others.
