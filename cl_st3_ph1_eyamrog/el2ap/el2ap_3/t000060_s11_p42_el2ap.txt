While each formulation preserves parts of the meaning established before,
it deletes other parts and adds new aspects of meaning
(Heritage and Watson, 1979, p. 129). In addition, there is
a reﬂexive relationship between ﬁrst and second versions: Formulations make
meanings explicit which were implicit in the prior version (or
which are at least treated as if they had been
implicated in it), but their local meaning rests itself in
part on the versions they are meant to replace. When
studying semantic properties of formulations, it is important to attend
both to the sequential organization and the precise linguistic design
of the formulation. Deppermann (2011, p. 122)
