Given that Brazil imposed the most capital controls after the
global financial crisis, a study of this case contributed greatly
to this subject. Unlike cross-country studies of effectiveness and the
spillover effects of capital controls, Forbes et al. (2016) examine
whether Brazil’s controls during 2006-2013 had spillover effects on other
economies, besides their direct impact on the Brazilian capital account.
Forbes et al.’s (2016) regression shows that the imposition of
IOFs during the sample period reduced the position of institutional
investors in the asset class subject to the controls, specially,
fixed income instruments. However, the regression establishes that the effect
of reducing investor’s positions was even larger on some equity
classes, demonstrating a certain fear among investors regarding the government’s
controls.
