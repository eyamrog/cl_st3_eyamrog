While Borges (2015) reported only a partial success in the
micropropagation of V. sincorana, Neto (2009) managed to micropropagate V.
squamata. Some individuals of the micropropagated V. squamata were planted
in gardens and have been growing since then, for more
than a decade, having reached about 20 cm (figure 5
e, C.E.S. Silveira, not published data). So, the in vitro
propagation protocol of Vellozia squamata somehow overcame unknown factors that
generate high loss of seedlings produced via seeds.
