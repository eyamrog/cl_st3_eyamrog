Although research indicates that selfie behavior can become an addiction
(Kaur and Vig, 2016; Kela et al., 2017; Shah, 2015;
Singh and Lippmann 2017; Griffiths and Balakrishnan, 2018) little is
known about the impact, positive or negative, of this behavior.
Furthermore, there are several instruments and studies developed in Brazil
on problematic internet use and its impact on people's lives.
However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no
Brazilian study that addresses the behavior of taking selfies. We
can infer that this lack of Brazilian studies on selfie
behavior is due to the absence of an existing instrument
validated for use in Brazil.
