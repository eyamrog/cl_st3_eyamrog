At first sight, this activity might seem too simple and
just a pastime, but it actually set the scene for
participants to get connected to everyone through their tastes and
habits, giving them the opportunity to realize how diversity is
present everywhere and how people might feel about it. In
other words, it helped participants see that despite the disagreements
that may arise, we have some common ground as human
beings and, as such, a longing for respect. In this
perspective, play becomes this powerful revolutionary activity (Newman & Holzman,
2002), in which participants reflect about themselves and others in
their process of becoming (Liberali, 2019).
