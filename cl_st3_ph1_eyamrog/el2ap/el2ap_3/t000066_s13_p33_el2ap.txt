The power of human action is grounded in encounters because
it is related to the infinite possibilities of composition between
the affectus. In order words, it is related to the
potential to affect and be affected. In this sense, Sawaia
(2009) explains that affectus is responsible for the union of
powers in conceiving a single body and a single mind.
This joining of power constitutes the collective political subject and
the multitude, originated from peopleâ€™s desire to ensure better conditions
for their existence towards a common objective that can improve
the social benefit of the collectivity (Spinoza, 2017).
