The evolutionary effects mij(t)and vij(t) that affect the magnitude of
trait change due to the mutualism and cheating interactions, respectively,
are defined as the relative effect of species j on
i, such that mij(t)=amijqij(t) and vij(t)=avijqij(t). amij and avij depict,
respectively, the presence of a mutualistic or a cheating interaction
between species i and j. The term qij(t) is defined
as: <>, where the parameter Î± controls the sensitivity of
the evolutionary effect due to trait matching between species i
and j and aik=1 if there is a mutualistic or
a cheating interaction between i and k and aik =
0, otherwise.
