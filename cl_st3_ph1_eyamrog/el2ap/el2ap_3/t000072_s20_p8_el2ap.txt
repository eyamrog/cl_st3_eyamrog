The species cataloged in the seed bank are similar in
30% (12 species) with the floristic study that is being
conducted in the same area as the present study. Thus,
this similarity is consistent with the considerations of Marcante et
al. (2009), who highlight that there is, in general, great
differentiation between the composition of the seed bank and the
vegetation itself. The diversity of vegetation tends to be greater
than the diversity in the seed bank, as some dispersed
seeds cannot persist for long periods in the soil in
a dormant state, expecting optimal conditions for germination (Martins et
al. 2015).
