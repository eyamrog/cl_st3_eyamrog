Among the species recognized in the present study, a possible
new occurrence was found for the São Paulo State, Combretum
leprosum Mart., initially recognized for the semideciduous forest in Minas
Gerais and Espírito Santo States (Flora do Brasil 2020 2021).
Queiroz et al. (2021) also report the occurrence of C.
leprosum seedlings for the same study area and bring evidence
that suggest the occurrence of this species in the São
Paulo State. Ongoing floristic studies may confirm the existence of
adult individuals of C. leprosum in the study area, thus
reinforcing the importance of studies on seed banks as an
important tool for studying flora.
