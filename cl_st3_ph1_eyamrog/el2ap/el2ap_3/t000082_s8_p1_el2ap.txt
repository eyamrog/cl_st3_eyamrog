Selection imposed by ecological interactions is one of the main
forces impacting phenotypic patterns observed across levels of biological organization
(Thompson 2005). Selection imposed by ecological interactions partially shapes trait
matching among interacting individuals (Zhang et al. 2012), trait distributions
within interacting populations (Bronstein et al. 2003), trait variation across
populations of the same species (Thompson 2005), and trait patterns
at the community level (Strauss & Irwin 2004). At the
community level, ecological interactions can be a driving force leading
to trait convergence (Wilson et al. 2012) and trait disparity
(Siepielski & Benkman 2010). In this sense, theory and empirical
results indicate that distinct ecological interactions (e.g., mutualistic, antagonistic) may
favor different trait outcomes at the community level (Thompson 1994).
