In the first stage, the original version of the questionnaire
was translated into Brazilian Portuguese by the authors of this
study who are fluent in English. The translation process included
the general analysis of each item of the questionnaire, comparing
it to the original English version. This correspondence transcends the
literalness of the words, including more subtle aspects, such as
the impact that a term may have on the cultural
context of the target population. This comparative analysis between the
versions (translated and original) is necessary because the literal correspondence
of a term does not imply similar interpretations in different
cultures (Giusti & Befi-Lopes, 2008). In this approach, there is
the understanding that culture has a significant impact on the
understanding of the variables, necessitating cross-cultural adaptation to ensure that
the original objective of the scale is equally achieved when
applied in the language in which it is being adapted
(Herdman et al., 1998).
