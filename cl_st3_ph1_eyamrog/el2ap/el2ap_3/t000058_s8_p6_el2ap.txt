Biodiversity is a world heritage and must be valued for
the development of each nation. Similarly, national scientific collections must
be seen as the memorial heritage of the country’s diversity
[5–7], since they are temporary records of the diversity of
the organisms in an environment. Furthermore, biological collections are of
extreme importance to science, given that their data allow for
strategic research of the country and are of enormous value
in complying with international commitments and treaties [5,8,9]. Their use
in research is essential for any researcher in need of
reference to a currently recognized name and other information related
to any taxon of interest [10,11].
