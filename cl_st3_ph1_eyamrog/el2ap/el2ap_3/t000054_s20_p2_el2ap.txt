In the particular conditions of Latin America, where large unexplored
areas and communities that have not come into contact with
"modernity" persist, the vision of biodiversity is polarized in two
directions: on the one hand, the western/usufructuary, in which everything
what exists on planet Earth can be considered a resource
and is susceptible to massive exploitation; on the other, the
traditional/indigenous, attached to respect for nature, coexistence with all species,
and its rational use and even worship. Unfortunately, as pointed
by Mart√≠nez et al. (2018) although the properties of a
resource are independent of human being, it is the latter
who attributes its market value to it and who determines
the extent to which it is exploited or conserved.
