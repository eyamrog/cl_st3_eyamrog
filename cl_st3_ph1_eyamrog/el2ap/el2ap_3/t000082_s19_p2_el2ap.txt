We observed that cheating interactions affect the number of species
trait clusters. At low levels of cheating interactions (p =
0.01, with p being the frequency of cheating interactions in
the networks), we found a low number of clusters in
simulations (2.43±0.62, Fig. 2d-f). At intermediate levels of cheating interactions,
the number of trait clusters increased (p = 0.5, 3.03±0.79).
Finally, if most of the network is formed by cheating
interactions then, on average, we saw the formation of lower
numbers of species trait clusters, similar to when there is
low frequency of cheating interactions (p = 0.9, Fig. 2d-f).
Thus, increasing the frequency of cheating interactions fuels trait disparity
in mutualistic networks by promoting the emergence of trait clusters.
However, these trait clusters disappear under higher frequencies of cheating
interactions.
