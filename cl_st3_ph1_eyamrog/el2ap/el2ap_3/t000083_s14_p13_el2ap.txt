MANOVA was applied to analyze the relationship between several response
variables in relation to the construct and then ANOVA was
performed to evaluate the mean results regarding the mean difference
of the individual factors in the level of selfie intensity
(low, mild, moderate and severe). We applied the calculation of
the average variance extracted (AVE) which is one of the
indicators that can be used to assess the quality of
the structural model of a psychometric instrument (Hair et al.,
2009; Fornell & Larcker, 1981). To this end, the AVE
calculations were performed based on the parameters estimated through Structural
Equation Modeling (SEM). The AVE represents the squared factor loading.
In the SEM equation, the measurement error and the square
of the factorial loadings are indicated in the same unit
of measurement, therefore, the SEM represents the average proportion of
the items' variance explained by the latent variable (or common
factor between the items). Fornell and Larcker (1981) presented the
AVE value equal to or greater than 0.50 as an
indicator of adequate model fit. According to several researchers, it
is possible to assess convergent validity through AVE and Cronbach's
alpha (Fornell & Larcker, 1981; Pestana and Gageno, 2005; Hair
et al., 2009). The use of AVE for convergent validity
is growing in the scientific literature and can be easily
verified in recent empirical research (Fock et al., 2013; Niclasen
et al.,2013; Obasi et al., 2014). For the analysis of
variance of the factors identified in the SBS, the four
levels of selfitis were considered: 20-40 indicates low selfitis behavior,
41 to 60 indicates mild selfitis behavior, 61 to 80
indicates moderate selfitis behavior and 81 to 100 indicates severe
level on selfitis behavior.
