Thus, in the Random scenario, negative effects are not concentrated
in central species but distributed across the network. For each
combination of empirical networks (n = 24) and scenarios (Random
and Central), we performed 1.500 simulations, leading to a total
of 72.000 simulations. We ran all simulations until the equilibrium.
