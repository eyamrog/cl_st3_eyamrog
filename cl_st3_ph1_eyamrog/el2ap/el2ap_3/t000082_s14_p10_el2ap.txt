We evaluated the impact of the emergence of cheating interactions
on the coevolutionary process. For each simulation, we define a
probability p that an interaction within a “mutualistic network” is
not a mutualism per se but a cheating interaction. We
explore values of p ranging from 0.01 to 1 to
test how different frequencies of cheating interactions change the outcome
of the coevolutionary process. Thus, in this first analysis, we
assume that cheating interactions are randomly distributed across all interactions
in the mutualism network, whereas the frequency of cheating interactions
in the network is fixed in each simulation. This process
of defining the outcome of interactions based on p generates
a network with both positive and negative effects, merging the
effect of mutualism and cheaters in a single network (Melián
et al. 2009). Because we are defining a cheating interaction
as interactions with a negative effect on one partner and
positive effect on the other one (i.e., an antagonism), we
prohibit the occurrence of double-negative effects between two species. For
this purpose, we only apply the transformation from positive to
negative effect based on p in the lower triangle of
the adjacency matrix, therefore maintaining cheating interactions as a combination
of positive and negative effects. We also assumed that the
outcome of the interaction did not change across time. Such
an approach does not allow us to explore the effects
of conditional outcomes of many interactions, but it is a
starting point to unravel how cheating interactions changes the outcome
of coevolution. We performed a set of sensitivity analyses in
which we relaxed the assumption of fixed outcomes of interactions
in time, allowing interactions to shift from positive and negative
outcomes during simulations. Our sensitivity analyses suggest that temporal variability
on the interaction outcome does not influence our main results
(Supporting Information).
