One of the most influential studies on the quality of
online learning was Garrison, Anderson, and Archerâ€™s (1999) Community of
Inquiry (CoI) Model. Their framework aimed to identify key elements
for a successful text-based communication in online courses, with the
assumption that learning occurs through the interaction of three core
elements: social presence, cognitive presence and teaching presence. Although their
study recognized the use of emoticons in forum interactions, identifying
the role of emerging languages in educational experiences via mobile
devices may contribute to the discussions regarding online communication. Researchers
have continued to analyze different forms of communication in online
learning using the CoI model (Micsky & Foels, 2019; Rath,
2012).
