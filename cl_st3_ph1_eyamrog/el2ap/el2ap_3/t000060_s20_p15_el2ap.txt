The first part of such a question takes the form
of a statement, in which the lawyer can include his/her
version of events (the information). The second part consists of
a tag, which exerts various forms of interactive pressure upon
the witness (the social). This form of courtroom question is
therefore a paradigm example of linguistic form matching pragmatic function,
and in consequence it is not surprising that many questions
in cross examination take the form of tags, and that
there are many types of tags â€“ some of them
unusual in everyday discourse.
