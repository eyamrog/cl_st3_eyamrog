The variables in Table 2 were chosen in line with
the objective of our study, to investigate inequalities in the
probabilities of remote work in view of different socioeconomic and
work characteristics. Also, those variables were selected according to: i)
classical studies that addressed labor market issues as in Mincer
(1962) for labor force participation decisions, Heckman (1974) for shadow
prices and market wages, and Mincer (1974) and Willis (1986)
for earnings functions; and ii) recent empirical works on labor
issues associated with COVID-19 – see Bridi (2020), Mattei and
Heinen (2020), Pouliakas (2020), Yasenov (2020), Al Masri et al.
(2021), Corseuil et al. (2021) and Góes et al. (2021).
