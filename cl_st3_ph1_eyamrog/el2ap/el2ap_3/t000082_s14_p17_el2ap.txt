In our baseline coevolutionary model, the trait barrier 𝜀𝑖𝑗 indicates
that the evolutionary effects of a cheater species on a
victim became negligible. To explore the effect of cheating interactions
on the network structure, we changed our baseline coevolutionary model
to add an additional trait barrier, bij, defining the maximum
absolute trait mismatch between two species traits so they can
