Identification. This species is recognized by small cespitose basidiomata and
by the presence of a white to yellowish, subiculum that
spreads throughout the substrate, which is generally decomposing wood (Baseia
et al. 2003). Some specimens previously identified as G. schweinitzii
for the neotropics were different species based on phylogenetic analysis
and thus the species could be endemic of the region
were the type material was collected (Accioly et al. 2019)
