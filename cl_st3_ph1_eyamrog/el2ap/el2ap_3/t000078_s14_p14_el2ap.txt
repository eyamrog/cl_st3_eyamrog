In the second stage, real estate formal market data are
used. The database was obtained from the Brazilian Company for
Heritage Studies (Embraesp) with 4,758 thousand vertical and horizontal newly
constructed housing between January 2006 and March 2013 for the
municipality of SÃ£o Paulo (MSP). The base covers 271.861 apartments
and houses in the period. According to the 2010 Census,
the number of domiciles (formal and informal) is 3,573,509 units
in the MSP. Even though we are considering about 6%
of total domiciles in the MSP, each property launch price
captures the average market price behavior of each neighborhood composed
of many existing apartments and houses. Furthermore, the Embraesp database
permits the understanding that property launching growth rate and housing
typologies are spatially heterogeneous, reflecting the non-isotropic pattern of land
use policy, consumer behavior, and financial viability of constructor companies.
This database has already been widely used in applied work
(Biderman, 2001; Maciel, 2010; Nadalin, 2010; Campos, 2017; Campos and
Almeida, 2018).
