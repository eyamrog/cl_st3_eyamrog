The American Psychiatric Association (APA) has officially confirmed that taking
"selfies" is a mental disorder. The APA made this publication
during its annual board meeting in Chicago (Vincent, 2014). The
disorder has been termed selfitis, being defined as the desire
to take pictures of oneself (body and/or face) via a
smartphone and post them on social media (McLean et al.,
2019). It is a worldwide phenomenon, especially among adolescents and
young adults (Griffiths and Balakrishnan, 2018; Lin et al., 2019;
McLean et al., 2019). Selfitis behavior involves several actions among
them preparing the image (staging), editing the image such as
color and background changes, selecting the best image, posting the
image, viewing and evaluating the amount of "likes" and comments
made by others towards the posted image (Balakrishnan and Griffiths,
2017; McLean et al., 2019). About half of the 7.6
billion people in the world are on some form of
social media, with an average of over 170 selfies per
day (Kemp, 2018). This equates to 650 billion selfies per
day worldwide. The practice is more widespread on some platforms
than others. On Snapchat, for example, 74% of all images
shared are selfies (Reilly et al., 2019).
