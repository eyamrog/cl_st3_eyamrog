Since then, the GPB has offered free Play and Talk
workshops in different languages and time zones around the world.
As stated in the GPB Mission, these sessions offer people
a chance to play, improvise, grow, and tell stories together.
It is a place to share and listen to others
while everyone is going through a crisis. From kids to
adults, the GPB has tried to embrace people virtually, as
that was not possible physically, in an attempt to experience
joy, pain, reflection, creativity, and affection through play in a
way they can change their immediate reality first, but also
aim at long-term outcomes.
