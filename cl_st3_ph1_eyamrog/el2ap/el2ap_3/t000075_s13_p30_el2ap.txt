An extremely important point these regressions establish is that the
regulatory measures imposed by source countries on their capital outflows
were relatively more efficient than the inflow controls imposed by
recipient economies (Ghosh et al., 2014). Based on their regressions,
the authors defend the necessity for global coordination for capital
controls and other regulatory measures, both between source and recipient
economies, and between recipient economies, since this kind of coordination
can potentially soften currency wars, such in Korinek (2012).
