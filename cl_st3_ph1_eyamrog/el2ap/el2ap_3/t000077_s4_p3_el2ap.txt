The relatively high participation in remote work for workers with
complete college education and from the public sector stood out,
with a very significant difference compared to other levels of
education and to the other employment statuses. The direct, strong
and monotonic relation between participation in remote work and labor
income also stood out: the remote work share increases rapidly
from the 60th percentile and even more rapidly from the
80th.
