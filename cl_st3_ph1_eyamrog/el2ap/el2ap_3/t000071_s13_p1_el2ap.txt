First released in 2002, the use of OJS has grown
to 25,671 active journals in 2020, publishing in 155 countries,
with 81.7 percent originating in the Global South, led by
journals in Indonesia, Brazil, and the USA, and with research
published in 56 languages, led by English, Indonesian, and Portuguese
(Fig. 1).6 These journals published an average of 38.8 articles
in 2020, and over 4.7 million articles since 2010. PKP
gathers this and other data from these journals through the
software’s optional beacon feature. The beacon provides PKP with access
to journal data, although a portion of journal users turn
the beacon off, implying the numbers reported here are undercounts.
Other studies have found that the journals using OJS are
largely open access (89 percent), and account for 60 percent
of what are termed “diamond open access” journals, neither charging
readers subscription fees nor authors APCs (Alperin et al., 2017;
Becerril et al., 2021; Edgar & Willinsky, 2010;). While largely
indexed by Google Scholar and in more limited ways by
the Directory of Open Access Journals, the journals utilizing OJS
represent an emerging force in research that includes a mix
of century-old journals, new and inexperienced publishers, and a few
outright crooks.7
