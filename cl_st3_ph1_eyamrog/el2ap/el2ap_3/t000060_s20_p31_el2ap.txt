Our analysis shows that formulations are very important tools in
courtroom interaction since the questioners can selectively preserve, omit, alter,
or even add to what the interlocutors have said. It
is also relevant to consider that, by means of a
textual-interactive perspective to the spoken language, it is possible to
observe the process of text construction as well as the
strategies that are employed to achieve the interests and purposes
of the participants in this kind of forensic context.
