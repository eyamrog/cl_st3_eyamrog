In the other case I intend to briefly explore, we
look at other Brazilian immigrants in Portugal, but now from
a different point of view: from the family members who
remain in Brazil, more specifically in the city of Governador
Valadares. For these migrants, the issue was different: they lived
the experience in Portugal as "target migrants", with specific goals
to amass during migration. A specific amount for building their
homes and setting up a business that would guarantee the
family's livelihood. The experience of these immigrants is the result
of an obvious kinship order in Governador Valadares. As I
have previously demonstrated elsewhere, this kinship order was based on
the desire of constituting standalone family units which simultaneously concentrate
relationship bundles.
