The PNT and the PNM Serra do Mendanha (Pontes et
al. 2015) shared 25 amphibian species (SÃ¸rensen index of similarity
= 0.6; Magurran & McGill 2011) and 29 reptiles (=
0.8). Despite these similarities, 13 amphibian species were exclusive to
the PNT, while 27 were exclusive to the Serra do
Mendanha. Similarly, seven species of reptiles were exclusive to PNT
and ten to the Serra do Mendanha. Similarities of the
herpetofauna between these two areas would be accounted at least
partly because they would have originally been part of a
single continuous forest in the past, and can also be
indicative of the effectiveness of the reforestation of the Tijuca
massif, carried out during the 19th century (Rocha et al.
2003, Rocha 2017). However, the existence of a unique fauna
in both areas also reinforces the importance of the preservation
of both forests for the protection of the herpetofauna of
the Atlantic Forest in general.
