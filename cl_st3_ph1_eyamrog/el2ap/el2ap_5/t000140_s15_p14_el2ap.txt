Although textbooks are not the focus of this analysis, it
is still worth noting that the majority of courses had
an assigned textbook, amounting to 66.0 percent (2,238 syllabuses) of
our sample (Table 5). This is more than twice as
many syllabuses as had assigned readings (923 syllabuses; 27.2%) (Table
3.a). The textbooks were assigned in relatively similar proportions across
the three subject areas, 69.3 percent of the science syllabuses
requiring a textbook, and 60.0 percent of the social sciences
syllabuses, and with 70.0 percent of the humanities syllabuses. Given
the frequency with which courses rely on textbooks, it is
worth noting that the steady price increases for textbooks over
the last few decades have levelled off in the last
few years, some of this as a result of open
textbook initiatives (e.g., Open Stax, Flatearth), which represent another of
the digital transformations specific to academic publishing (Fox, 2020; Jhangiani,
2018).
