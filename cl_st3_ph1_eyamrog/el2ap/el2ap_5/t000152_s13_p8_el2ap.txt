Although the National Educational Plan (PNE) projects annual growth of
1.8% in HEI enrolments (Ministry of Education of Brazil 2020b),
there are other factors that reinforce the difficulties in access
to higher education. The less developed regions of the country
do not have a wide dispersal of public HEIs, barring
or hindering access for high school graduates unable to move
to large urban centres. Only in recent years have public
HEIs begun to open decentralized campuses in the more remote
regions of the country. On the other hand, thanks to
Decree 9057/2017 (Federative Republic of Brazil 2017b), which allows for
and recognizes degrees obtained entirely through distance education, that sector
has expanded rapidly. Nonetheless, there is considerable resistance and a
low acceptance of distance learning within the Brazilian educational establishment.
