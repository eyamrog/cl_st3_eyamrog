The analysis of external forces (for example Desai and Yetman,
2015), in particular the donation market, for the configuration of
governance in the third sector, still lacks operational and empirical
evidence for a stronger support. The underlying governance structure identified
in this research is a reflection of internal and external
forces (including the donation market) in NPO governance. Renz (2007)
proposes that project governance be the response to the gap
between governance (strategy) and project management (operation) in the third
sector environment, reconfiguring the generalities for the for-profit organizations. We
advance this understanding by suggesting that projects bring reflections to
governance through temporary governance mechanisms. Therefore, governance would be (re)configured
through the projects, in a continuum.
