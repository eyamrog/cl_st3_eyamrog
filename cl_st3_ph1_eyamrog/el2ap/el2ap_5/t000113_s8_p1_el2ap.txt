The historical and contemporary processes of discrimination, inequality, stigmatization, injustice,
social exclusion, racism, and violence have affected different sectors of
the Brazilian population (e g., women, blacks, indigenous people, immigrants,
the homeless, elderly, and special education students). The colonial history
of American countries reached thousands of human beings in a
state of oppression.
