Data analysis: the experimental design was completely randomized in a
2 x 5 factorial scheme respectively with two salts and
five saline concentrations. The variables expressed as percentages were converted
to arc sen <>. Data were subjected to analysis of
variance and when significant, qualitative variables were compared by the
Scott-Knott test at 5% error probability and quantitative variables were
submitted to regression analysis using the Sisvar software (Ferreira 2011).
