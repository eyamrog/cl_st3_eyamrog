The analysis of the number of citations made in the
native language of the authorâ€™s country revealed that there was
a linear relationship between the percentage of publications and their
impact on their native language. Brazil and the USA publish
the least amount of research in their own language and
have a more substantial audience in other languages. In contrast,
Colombia, Cuba, Spain, and Peru publish the most in their
native language and, thus, have an impact that is predominantly
in Spanish. We have also noticed that in the case
of Spain and the USA, their lowest impact is found
in SciELO, which suggests that their citations come from outside
the domain of SciELO CI. On the other hand, the
Latin American countries were notable for the extent of their
impact in this research area (about two-thirds of what they
obtain from the WoS platform).
