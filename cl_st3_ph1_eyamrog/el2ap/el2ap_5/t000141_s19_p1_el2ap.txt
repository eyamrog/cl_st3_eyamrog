Regarding the records that regulate the process of economic reopening,
among the 27 federative units, only 18 formalized reopening documents
based on epidemiological and health indicators. The states of the
Federal District, Goiás, Paraná, Roraima, and Tocantins, have not formalized
official plans to resume economic activities. Although four other states
(Bahia, Pernambuco, Amapá, and Maranhão) have government plans to make
social isolation flexible, they were not included in this analysis
due to municipal scope and absence of well-defined indicators.
