Next, by evaluating the discrimination measures of the variables, we
decided to add a sixth dimension, since we did not
get discrimination measures for three dimensions above the dimensionsâ€™ inertia.
The six dimensions explained 78% of the variance, and allowed,
at least, one value of the discrimination measure to be
above the inertia of its corresponding dimension. This improved the
adjustment of the model.
