On the meta-worry scale (Mean [M] = 12.5, Standard Deviation
[SD] = 4.90), 41% (n = 837) of the participants
scored above the mean, and 59.0% (n = 1205) scored
values up to the mean. As for anxiety or depression
symptoms (cutoff at score three), 36.2% (n = 739) had
symptoms suggestive of anxiety, 24.8% (n = 506) had symptoms
suggestive of depression, 42.8% (n = 873) had symptoms suggestive
of just one diagnosis (anxiety or depression), and 18.2% (n
= 372) had both. In the full sample, 57,2% (n
= 1169) of the participants did not show significant symptoms
for anxiety and/or depression.
