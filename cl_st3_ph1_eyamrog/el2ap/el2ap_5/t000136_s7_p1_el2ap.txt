Governance is a constant topic in studies on Nonprofit Organizations
(NPO). In general terms, governance in the third sector refers
to the set of internal and external mechanisms designed to
limit the improper use of resources and to ensure that
NPO fulfills its fiduciary duty, as well as to better
align the executivesâ€™ goals with those of the NPO and
the audience it attends (Harris et al., 2015).
