A number of amphibian and reptile species of interest occur
in the PNT, including those endemics to either the Atlantic
Forest or to Rio de Janeiro state and/or municipality, those
under some threat of extinction, and those with declining populations.
The presence of all those taxa reinforces the importance of
the park for the conservation of the regionâ€™s herpetofauna. The
considerable diversity of reptiles and amphibians found in the PNT
also testifies to the success of the reforestation program of
this protected area, which now provides an important refuge for
species of both groups. The results of our inventory, which
recorded a total of 74 species, constitute the first comprehensive
published overview of the composition and abundance of the herpetofauna
of the Parque Nacional da Tijuca.
