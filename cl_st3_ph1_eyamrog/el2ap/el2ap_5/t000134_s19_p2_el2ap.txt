The cumulative curve for the amphibian species reached the asymptote
at 213 hours of sampling with a total richness of
22 species, while the curve for the reptiles reached the
asymptote at 276 hours, with a total of 14 species,
based on a total sampling effort of 460 hours (Figure
8). The confidence intervals of the rarefaction curves converged to
zero for the amphibians, but not for the reptiles, for
which the error was estimated as 2.3 species (Figure 8).
The species richness estimated by the Bootstrap procedure was similar
to that recorded by the VES method for both amphibians
(estimated richness = 22.4 species) and reptiles (estimated richness =
15.6 species).
