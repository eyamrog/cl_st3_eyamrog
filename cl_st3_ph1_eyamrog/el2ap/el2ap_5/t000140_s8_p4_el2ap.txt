In 2013, Access Copyright sued York University for failing to
pay the Copyright Board of Canada approved tariff covering the
millions of copies associated with York from 2011 to 2013.2
Access Copyright is a not-for-profit collective that represents 11,000 Canadian
writers, visual artists, and publishers. It strikes agreements with organizations,
such as universities and provincial ministries of education, to cover
royalty payments for course materials. The Copyright Board of Canada
has approved an Interim Rate for an annual Access Copyright
tariff of $14.31 per university student (ACT, 2019). Yet with
much unsettled in applying fair dealing to education, a quarter
of Canada’s 96 universities are not paying Access Copyright’s tariff
(Access Copyright, 2020a). In the face of the 2013 Access
Copyright lawsuit, York claimed its employees followed the university’s guidelines
on the “fair dealing” exception in Canada’s Copyright Act. York’s
guidelines advise that “a single copy of a short excerpt
from a copyright-protected work may be provided or communicated to
each student enrolled in a class or course” (“Fair Dealing,”
2012). In 2017, the federal court ruled against York, holding
that “the Interim Tariff is mandatory” and “the York Fair
Dealing Guidelines are not fair” for, among other reasons, its
“material negative impacts on the market” (CCLA, 2017, 13, 356,
353). In 2020, the Federal Court of Appeal ruled that
“the tariff is not mandatory,” as the Copyright Board of
Canada tariff-setting process is only intended to protect the public
from excessive pricing (YU, 2020, 206). The appeal court also
upheld the earlier decision that “York’s Guidelines did not ensure
that copying… was necessarily fair dealing” (311). At this point,
the Supreme Court of Canada has agreed to hear the
case.
