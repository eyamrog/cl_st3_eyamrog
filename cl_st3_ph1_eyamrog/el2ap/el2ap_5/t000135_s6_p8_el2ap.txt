This is the first study known to the authors which
shows a reduction in prenatal procedures, diabetes and medical consultations
in middle-income countries. This data is extremely important to alert
the scientific community and managers about the postponed agenda for
2021. Studies with primary data or data that can point
out the possible effects on mortality, infant mortality, drop in
immunization and the development of disabilities, are fundamental for detailing
this gap. Although the recording of procedures for actions directed
towards chronic and prenatal diseases points to a reduction in
actions, the formalization of new procedures such as Teleconsultation in
Primary Care can benefit the reorganization of PHC services in
the SUS, to reduce the repressed demand and mitigate a
post-pandemic rebound effect resulting from the discontinuation of care. It
is important that, in addition to PHC practices, the effect
of the pandemic is monitored in relation to morbidity and
mortality patterns in hospital services resulting from preventable causes in
PHC, aiming to direct and restructure health practices even during
the period of restrictive measures to combat COVID-19.
