For all such reasons, it seems that, increasingly, the concept
of whole life education is asserted, given the advantages that
are offered in terms of flexibility, diversity and accessibility over
time and in space. It is this idea of permanent
education that must be thought afresh and widened. Because, besides
the necessary adaptations related to changes in professional life, it
must be considered as a continuous construction of the human
person, of its knowledges and aptitudes, of its capacity to
discern and act. It must lead each one to be
aware of oneself and of the surrounding environment, and to
play the given social role as a worker and citizen.
