Based on these results, maintaining the fluctuations in exchange rates
under control and ensuring that they remain within a specific
range is important regarding the value of the national currency,
foreign trade, growth, and employment, and also in terms of
preventing deaths of women and girls. This study is a
contribution to the literature as it is the first study
to reveal this subject matter empirically using current and advanced
analyzes. It is clear that the independence of the Central
Banks, whose main task is to protect the value of
the national currency, and the implementation of correct policies in
this direction is of vital importance. Policymakers have important responsibilities
in preventing violence and murder of women and girls, which
have become widespread and legitimized by discourses and policies. It
is essential to carry out future studies investigating widespread and
systematic violence against women and girls and femicide from an
economic perspective.
