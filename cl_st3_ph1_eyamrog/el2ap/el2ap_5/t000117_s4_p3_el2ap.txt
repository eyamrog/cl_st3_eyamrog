The second aspect, as announced in the Introduction of this
text, via the education portal of the Terra platform, regards
the constant need of the teachers to adapt to the
Internet’s connectivity, as if this was a big novelty in
the educational field or something that is about to take
place in the future of education. However, as analyzed, even
with the proliferation of the use of technological and communications
devices (videos, short films and long features, television among so
many other media interfaces), the discourses that connect these enunciations
feature the same regularity and are anchored in the same
discursive order. And even if they nowadays appear original and
innovative, they only scratch the surface, they are like the
foam of subjective forces that have been in the order
of the day since the end of the twentieth century
(Noguera-Ramírez, 2009).
