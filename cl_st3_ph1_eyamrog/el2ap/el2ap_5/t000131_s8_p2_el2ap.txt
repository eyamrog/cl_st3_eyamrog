In the last decades, lianas abundance and productivity increased in
tropical forests especially due to high rates of deforestation and
human-induced climate change (Granados & Korner 2002, Phillips et al.
2002, Wright et al. 2004, Zhu et al. 2004, Schnitzer
& Bongers 2011). In addition, evidences indicated that in mature
and undisturbed forests the increased density of lianas may be
consequence of changes in precipitation patterns (Schnitzer & Bongers 2011).
Another important factor that influences lianas growth and distribution is
light availability. For example, it is recognized that increased solar
radiation improves lianas seedlings growth rates (Kurzel et al. 2006,
Schnitzer & Bongers 2011). Furthermore, lianas may experience different amounts
of radiation and spectral quality during growth. Therefore, it is
expected a high phenotypic plasticity of lianas regarding photosynthetic and
gas exchange adjustments in response to different light conditions (Bazzaz
& Carlson 1982, Ribeiro et al. 2005). Stomatal opening level
determines the trade-off between CO2 absorption and water loss by
transpiration (Caemmerer & Baker 2007). The adaptative success under different
light conditions depends on adjustments of leaf morphology, anatomy, and
photosynthetic apparatus. Therefore, adjustments ensure greater efficiency in the conversion
of radiant energy into carbohydrates to sustain plant growth (Dias-Filho
1997, Campos & Uchida 2002, Gratani 2014).
