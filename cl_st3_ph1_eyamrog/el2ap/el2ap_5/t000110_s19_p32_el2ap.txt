According to Wetzel et al. (2015), Naviculadicta sassiana Metzeltin &
Lange-Bertalot (1998) was first described for the Amazonian region (Tapajós
river, Brasil), and was later on transferred to Sellaphora based
on the LM illustrations in Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot (1998). Sellaphora
sassiana was present in 5% of the core samples, reaching
9.6% maximum abundance. It occured in samples corresponding to the
Late Holocene (~408 cal. yr BP). The species was already
reported for Brazil, from the Tapajós river, as Naviculadicta sassiana
(e.g., Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot 1998), however, the present is to
be considered the first report for the country using its
correct name.
