President Fernando Henrique Cardoso initiated several public policies aimed at
extending access to higher education to socially vulnerable populations with
the creation of the National High School Examination (ENEM) in
1998 and the Higher Education Finance Fund (FIES) in 1999.
The latter greatly expanded the Educational Credit Program (CREDUC) launched
by the military dictatorship of Ernesto Geisel in 1975 (National
Education Development Fund 2017). From 2003 the government of President
Luís Inácio Lula da Silva embarked on a series of
education policies designed to democratize access to higher education. Significantly,
these aligned the standard curriculum for secondary education with the
ENEM and replaced the traditional and exclusionary “vestibular entrance examinations”.
The new HEI entrance system did not, however, immediately result
in increased admission to either public or private HEIs. In
the latter case, access was limited by high monthly tuition
fees. Thus, even though public institutions lacked the capacity to
admit the many students who were now graduating high school,
the private network was underutilized.
