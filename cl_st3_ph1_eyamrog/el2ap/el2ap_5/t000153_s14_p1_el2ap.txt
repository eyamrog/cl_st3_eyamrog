We have conducted an exploratory study, with a view to
addressing the relationship between the stigma of abortion and the
healthcare professionals who are members of the Network. By accessing
these professionals’ accounts, we sought to understand how healthcare providers
relate themselves, from their job, to the stigma of abortion,
prior to and after, their becoming members of this group.
A negative self-perception of the job done, fear of information
disclosure and a strong social disapproval of their job, together
with detachment from their fellow professionals (O’Donnell, Weitz, Freedman 2011),
are included as indicators of the stigma of abortion.
