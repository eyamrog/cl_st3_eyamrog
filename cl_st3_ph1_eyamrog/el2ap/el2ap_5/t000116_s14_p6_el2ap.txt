Once we completed this first stage, we performed a visual
inspection of the time series to recognize changes in the
pattern of total hospitalizations and groups within the three periods,
considering the sequential information from the three periods previously described.
We used segmented linear regression models of interrupted time series
(ITS) to determine the effect of changes in primary care
policy across all ACSC groups. When estimating the effects, ITS
models adjust to pre-existing trends before the policy change and
can detect changes in the pattern and level of the
trend. We built the segmented linear regression models using the
Prais method. The models included three segments, referring to the
periods previously described. We adjusted the baseline segment (January 2008
to December 2009) with an intercept and a trend estimate
variable.
