Seedling length: normal seedlings were obtained by sowing four repetitions
of 20 seeds moistened with distilled water or solution. Rolls
of paper containing the seeds were kept in a germination
chamber for seven days, at a temperature of 20 Â°C.
Total length of 10 normal seedlings were randomly evaluated for
each repetition using a millimeter ruler. The average length of
the seedlings was obtained by adding the number of measurements
of each repetition and dividing this by the number of
normal seedlings measured, with the results expressed in centimeters (cm)
(Nakagawa 1999).
