Therefore, the absence or poor governance practices can result in
donors’ reluctance to contribute to NPO. According to Fisman and
Hubbard (2005), a poor governance leads to a poor management
monitoring, thus giving rise to agency costs. Figure 2 presents
the R2 of each endogenous latent variable, which is a
measure of the model’s accuracy. It is important to mention
that R2 of the latent variable of the first order
reflective construct indicates how much this latent variable is a
sign of the latent variable of the second-order construct and,
therefore, we analyzed it, since it also generates paths in
the structural model.
