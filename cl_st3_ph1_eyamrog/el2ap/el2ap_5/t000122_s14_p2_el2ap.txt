In laboratory remaining sediment adhered on the thalli was physically
removed by several washing and spraying with sterilized seawater and
macrofauna individuals associated (e.g. molluscs, crustaceans and annelids) were removed
with tweezers. Thalli parts with filamentous and crustose macroalgae were
removed by cutting with scalpels. Removing of macrofauna individuals and
cutting of thalli parts with epiphytes were performed under a
stereoscopic microscope. All instruments used in the handling of macroalgae
were sterilized in ethanol (70°) and tweezers were flamed. The
seawater used in all procedures was sterilized through filtering using
sterilized cellulose membrane filters (0.45 µm pore), followed by heating
in a laboratory drying oven at 90 ºC for two
hours (after cooling, it was heated up again) (Borburema et
al. 2020). The seawater was not autoclaved to preserve its
vitamins.
