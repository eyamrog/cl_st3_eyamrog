Currently, there is not enough qualitative research done, at a
regional level, which allows for knowledge to be available on
strategies leading to removing the stigma linked to abortion. In
line with this fact, the proposal of the present work
is to contribute to such removal, exploring, from the perspective
of the professionals involved, their change in the perception of
stigma once they joined the Network. This article intends to
show how the performance of an active role, together with
the defense of oneâ€™s own activity, constitutes a form of
resistance to, and removal of, the stigma of abortion linked
to the professional job.
