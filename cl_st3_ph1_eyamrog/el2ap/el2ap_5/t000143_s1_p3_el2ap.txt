Results: The spatial distribution of the femicide rates was not
random and showed high spatial autocorrelation and predominance of significant
spatial groupings of municipalities with the highest mortality rates due
to feminicide in the central region of Sergipe State. In
the multiple regression, the percentage of women heads of families
and the Municipal Human Development Index were positively associated with
the rates of femicide in Sergipe's municipalities in the studied
period (p <0.05). The opposite situation occurred between the GINI
Index and the rates of femicide.
