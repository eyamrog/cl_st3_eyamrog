Overall, only six of the species recorded in the PNT
(Allobates olfersioides, Cycloramphus eleutherodactylus, Scinax trapicheiroi, Thoropa lutzi, Vitreorana eurygnatha,
and V. uranoscopa) are listed under some category of extinction
threat (Bergallo et al. 2000, ICMBIO 2018, IUCN 2020), although
the populations of 15 species are thought to be declining
(IUCN 2020). Of these six species, we recorded only one,
S. trapicheiroi, during our field surveys. However, although S. trapicheiroi
is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN due to
its greatly reduced area of occurrence of less than 20,000
km2 (Rodrigues & Carvalho-e-Silva 2004), it is assigned to the
Least Concern category in the Brazilian red list (ICMBIO 2018).
Verdade and Rodrigues (2007) allocated three other specific names for
geographically widespread populations into synonymy of Allobates olfersioides (Lutz, 1925):
A. alagoanus (Bokermann, 1967), A. capixaba (Bokermann, 1967), and A.
carioca (Bokermann, 1967). According to this arrangement, A. olfersioides is
widely distributed along much of the eastern coast of Brazil,
between Rio de Janeiro and the state of Alagoas, 2,000
km to the north. However, Haddad et al. (2013) still
considered these disconnected populations as different species: A. olfersioides in
the state of Rio de Janeiro, A. capixaba in the
states of Espírito Santo, and A. alagoanus in the state
of Alagoas. The clarification of whether these populations are distinct
species or lineages of the same species is essential (Forti
et al. 2017). In their assessment of the conservation status
of this amphibian, Haddad et al. (2016) considered only A.
carioca to be a synonym of A. olfersioides, which restricted
the species distribution to the metropolitan region of Rio de
Janeiro. In this case, the reduction of the area of
occurrence of the taxon to approximately 7,730 km², the lack
of records from some localities, including the PNT, over the
past 30 years, and the loss of habitat quality over
this period has led to the classification of this species
as Vulnerable in both the Brazilian red list (ICMBIO 2018)
and that of the IUCN (2020).
