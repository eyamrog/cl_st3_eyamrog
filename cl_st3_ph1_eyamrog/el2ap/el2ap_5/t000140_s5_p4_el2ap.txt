3. Deal fairly with professional writers: The third step applies
to media articles and trade book chapters (including poetry) that
are not licensed by the institution. These are largely the
work of professional writers and their publishers, and to whom,
we hold, royalties should be paid. After all, university faculty
assign these works because they are essential to achieving their
own and their institution’s instructional goals. If academic authors benefit
from the reputational gain, then professional authors are not less
deserving of recognition, rather than being subject to a fair-dealing
blanket exception for this million-student market in Canada (with more
on the financial and existential “substantial adverse effect” below).
