During the first examination, the most frequently observed species were
the protozoa Giardia duodenalis (41.9%), Entamoeba coli (41.9%) and Endolimax
nana (37.2%), and the helminth Hymenolepis nana (23.3 %). These
results are similar to those observed in other studies with
indigenous populations from Paran√° 4-6,8 and from other locations20, although
the majority of them had a lower frequency of H.
nana. Kato-Katz method was not used to assess the parasitic
load of geohelminths, which would be a limiter for the
assessment.
