One of the main arguments against considering the quem-sentences in
(1) as containing an ordinary appositive relative is the possibility
of eliding the anchor nominal in (1), but not in
real appositive relative clauses (for the anchor in these sentences
is the name been relativized. Also, I argued that in
utterances as (1), the anchor and the appositive can switch
places, contrary to what happens when an appositive relative is
present.
