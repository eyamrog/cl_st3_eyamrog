On the other hand, in the case of Brazil, publications
in other languages are more evident â€“ 17.8% are in
English (IN), followed by the USA, with 16.1% in Spanish
(ES) and 10.5% in Portuguese (PT) - once again the
US-Americans stand out as important contributors. Brazil has been making
a significant attempt to internationalize its journals, and this is
reflected in its current output. Peru and Colombia are countries
whose journals mainly publish articles in the national language.
