In other contemporary discourses, that have been disseminated internationally, one
intends to correct the missteps of western civilization as a
return to nature grounds children’s education. Instead of an institution
aimed at the relay of bookish culture and of civility
rules, one champions the “school as a site for meeting
nature”. This is the subtitle of the Brazilian publication Demmuring
Childhood, in its second edition in 2018. This publication puts
forward an educational proposal based on the fundamental principle of
the freedom to play in contact with nature and relates
experiences in schools working in Brazil and abroad, both public
and private, all which have proposed to “demmure” childhood. It
consists of an initiative of Instituto Alana in partnership with
the Child and Nature (Criança e Natureza) project, with civil
societies organizations geared towards education and childhood.
