The publication language is an essential means of communication owing
to of the extent of the international audience that it
encompasses for research purposes, as it directly affects the linguistic
accessibility and geographical scope of the question under study. English
is the lingua franca of science and the fact that
most educated people can understand it is a great benefit
[1]. It should also be noted that a significant part
of Latin American research is published in national languages and
this is often mentioned as one of the reasons for
the limited visibility of its scientific output [2-3]. Added to
this is the fact that some disciplines are characterized by
the their centrality on research of local significance. This is
reflected in the following: a) the large amount of scientific
output devoted to issues of national interest, b) a low
proportion of articles written in English, c) articles of predominantly
national authorship, d) low levels of international collaboration and e)
publications that tend to be published in national journals with
a limited circulation [4-7].
