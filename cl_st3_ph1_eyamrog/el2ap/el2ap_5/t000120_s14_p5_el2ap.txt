To identify the glomerospores, 50 grams of each soil sample
were weighed. The glomerospores were extracted by wet sieving (Gerdemann
& Nicolson 1963) and density gradient centrifugation (Daniels & Skipper
1982), and fixed on microscopy slides with PVLG (lacto-glycerol polyvinyl
alcohol) and Melzer resin (De Novais et al. 2017). The
spores were characterized morphologically (Schenck & PÃ©rez 1990) and identified
taxonomically (Morton 2018, Blaszkowski 2018, Goto & Jobim 2019).
