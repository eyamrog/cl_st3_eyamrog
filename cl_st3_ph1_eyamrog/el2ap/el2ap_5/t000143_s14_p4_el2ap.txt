The dependent variable of this study was determined from the
female mortality rates due to aggression, calculated according to each
municipality in Sergipe, in the period from 2013 to 2017.
The coefficients were grouped into five years to decrease the
temporal and geographic oscillations common in events of small magnitude.
Gross mortality data due to aggression of women were retrieved
from the Brazilian Ministry of Health's Mortality Information System and
causes of death were be considered according to the categories
of the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases
(ICD-10) in the range of X85 to Y09 19. The
data of the total resident population in each municipality in
the state of Sergipe in the period corresponding to the
study were based on the 2010 population census and estimates
for the inter-census years that were obtained on the website
of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics 17. Femicide
rates were calculated by dividing the data on mortality from
aggression by women in each of the Sergipeâ€™s municipalities by
the data on the total female population residing in the
same place.
