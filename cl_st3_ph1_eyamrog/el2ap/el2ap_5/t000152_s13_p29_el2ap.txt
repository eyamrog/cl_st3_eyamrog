Highlighting the insensitivity of the current Brazilian government to social
vulnerabilities and inequalities, the former Minister of Education Abraham Weintraub
stated in an interview with CCN Brasil that ENEM does
not have the mission to alleviate social injustices but merely
to select the best candidates. He went on to mock
the notion that some candidates lacked adequate internet access, claiming
that they could not have enrolled for the exam if
they did not have access (Mendon√ßa 2020). While the minister
argued that demands to postpone ENEM were politically motivated, other
major world powers like China cancelled their entrance exams even
after bringing the pandemic largely under control. In Brazil, meanwhile
the Education Minister is content to see the ENEM, which
was created with the mission of reducing exclusion, become a
means of strengthening social inequality.
