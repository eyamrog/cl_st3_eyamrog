The situation with regard to internet access is even more
aggravated in the North and Northeast regions of Brazil where
only 28.7% and 30%, respectively, of the population, enjoy access.
Among black and mixed-race people in the country as a
whole, just 23.9% have internet access (Brazilian Institute of Statistics
and Geography 2019). Given that a majority of the black
population lives in poverty, black students represent a particularly vulnerable
population in terms of access to quality internet service.
