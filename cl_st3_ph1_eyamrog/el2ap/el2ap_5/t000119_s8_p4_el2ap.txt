The common rue should be cultivated in neutral, well-drained and
periodically irrigated soils and under full sun. Once well-established, the
plant can tolerate drought periods but does not tolerate waterlogged
soils. Common rue development in semi-arid conditions is favorable because
it grows well even in very poor soils and tolerates
warm temperatures (Corrêa Júnior et al. 1994). Unfortunately, this species
is still poorly studied in several agronomic aspects, especially under
saline stress conditions.
