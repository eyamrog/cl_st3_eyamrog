Lacuneolimna novagallia Tudesque & Le Cohu is distinguished from Lacuneolimna
zalokariae Tudesque & Le Cohu (2015: 21) in its continuous
depressions in valve face, wider costae, and more expanded “cross-bar
network” (Tudesque et al. 2015). It was present in 0.6%
of the core samples, reaching 2% maximum abundance. The species
was identified from samples corresponding to the Late Holocene (~1.790
cal. yr BP). This is the first citation of the
species presence in Brazil.
