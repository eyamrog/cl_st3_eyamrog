Regarding to the results of the L. ferrea extract (Table
2), the strains of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and Klebsiella
pneumoniae did not form satisfactory inhibition halos. The decoction utilized
at the concentrations of 100, 50, 25 and 12.5 mg/mL
inhibited the growth of the E. faecalis strains, being the
highest statistical concentration similar to the positive control. These results
are justified by the cell wall composition of the Gram-positive
microbial agent, which is more simplified than Gram-negative bacteria. It
is noteworthy that these results are promising, since the decoction
technique of L. ferrea is simple, decreasing the quantity of
these microorganisms in surfaces of tools.
