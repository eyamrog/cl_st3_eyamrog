(Effect of salt stress on germination and initial development of
Ruta graveolens L.). Salinization occurring through irrigation on arable land
has been a growing concern worldwide. This study aimed to
evaluate the germination and initial development of common rue subjected
to different saline concentrations. Two salts (sodium chloride and calcium
chloride) and five saline concentrations (zero, -0.1, -0.2, -0.3, and
-0.4 MPa) were utilized. Germination tests, first germination count, seedling
length and dry weight were employed to assess seed responses
to the studied variations. Based on the results, the excess
of salt reduces the germination percentage and the initial development
of common rue seedlings, regardless of the substance used for
stress induction.
