The measurement of the floral bracts was done in the
structures of the middle of the inflorescence and additional information

1983, Costa et al. 2007, Rosa 2011, Flora do Brasil
2020 under construction), as well as the Brazilian virtual herbarium
Herb√°rio Virtual REFLORA (Reflora cont. updated) and speciesLink network.
