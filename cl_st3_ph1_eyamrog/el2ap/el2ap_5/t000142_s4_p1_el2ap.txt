The current living conditions of individuals and their economic status
affect their psychology and behavior. Therefore, it is very imperative
to investigate the widespread and systematic violence and murders of
women from an economic perspective, as well as the feminist,
sociological, criminological, human rights, and decolonial paradigms. It is also
necessary to investigate the effects of macro-economic phenomena on the
violent deaths of women and shape the monetary and fiscal
policies based on the findings to prevent future murders.
