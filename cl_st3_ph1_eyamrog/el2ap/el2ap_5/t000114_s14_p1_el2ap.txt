Study site - The Parque Nacional do Caparaó (PNC, figure
1) is located in the Southeast of Brazil along the
boundary of the States Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo (20°37'
to 20°19'S and 41°43' to 41°55'W). Its territory extends almost
32,000 ha with nearly 80% (the entire eastern portion) of
it belonging to the municipalities of Espírito Santo State (ICMBio
accessed 06/01/2021a, Coutinho 2015). The Park is entirely immersed in
the Atlantic Forest domain with predominance of Dense Mountain Ombrophilous
Forest and Dense High Mountain Ombrophilous Forest in the study
site (Coutinho 2015). In addition to forests, we can find
high elevation grass lands at 1,600 to 1,700 m a.s.l
with herbaceous to shrubby vegetation and rocky outcrops (ICMBio accessed
06/01/2021a; Coutinho 2015). The climate is described as tropical in
altitude, with average annual temperatures around 19 °C to 22
°C and annual rainfall between 1,000 and 1,500 mm, with
higher volumes from November to January (ICMBio accessed 06/01/2021b).
