The frequencies of total enteroparasites and species of enteroparasites, and
the frequency of polyparasitism, found before and after the mass
treatment of the population with antiparasitic medication are showes in
Tabel 1. In the initial examination, before antiparasitic treatment, 43
samples of fecal material were examined; 81.4% (35/43) were positive
for enteroparasites and 48.8% (21/43) indicated the presence of polyparasitism,
and the most common association was Hymenolepis nana and Entamoeba
coli. Protozoan cysts and helminth eggs were observed in 79.1%
(34/43) and 30.2% (13/43) of the samples, respectively.
