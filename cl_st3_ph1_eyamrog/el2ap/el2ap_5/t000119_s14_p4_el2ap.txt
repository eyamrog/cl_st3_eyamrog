Germination: test was performed with four replicates of 100 seeds
distributed in plastic boxes (gerbox) on three germitest paper sheets
moistened with distilled water or saline solution at a ratio
of 2.5 times the paper weight. After sowing, the plastic
boxes were kept in Bio-Oxygen Demand (BOD) chamber at constant
temperature of 20 Â°C in the presence of constant light.
Seed germination counts were performed at seven and 28 days
(when the test was ended) and the results expressed as
percentage (Brasil 2009).
