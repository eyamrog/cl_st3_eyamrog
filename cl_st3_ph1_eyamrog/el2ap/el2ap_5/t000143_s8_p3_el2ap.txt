It is clear that despite the promulgation of what is
known as the “Maria da Penha Law” which aimed to
create mechanisms to curb domestic and family violence against women,
female mortality from aggression in Brazil has increased more than
twice in the last 30 years (Maria da Penha Law,
Law n. 11.340, August 7th, 2006; Meneghel et al., 2013).
It is not known for sure whether the increase in
police records of femicide reflects an increase in the number
of cases, or a decrease in underreporting, since the “Maria
da Penha Law” is relatively new, so that there may
be an ongoing learning process by the judicial authorities 5.
On the other hand, this can had happened because this
device often left room for reprisals that often culminated in
femicide 8,9. In order to change this sad Brazilian reality,
another important law called the “Femicide Law” was implemented with
the purpose of being even more rigorous in coercing aggressors
and making this phenomenon still visible. With the amendment of
article 121 of the Brazilian Penal Code, femicide becomes qualified
in the list of heinous crimes (Femicide Law, Law n.
13.104, March 9th, 2015; Teles, 2018).
