In the present study, this taxon was identified as Pinnularia
cf. liyanlingae, because the specimens presented smaller dimensions than those
described by Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot (2007, L: 94-200 µm, W:
24-32 µm). The taxon was found in 15% of the
core samples and reached 1.5% maximum abundance. It was identified
in samples corresponding to the early Late Holocene to the
core top (~1.322 cal. yr BP to the present day).
