Controlled detachment causes numerous concerns in the world in terms
of the potential unintended consequences for the interruption, or partial
functioning, or change of focus of PHC services. The World
Health Organization has observed a 75% reduction in services for
non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and hypertension 27. This reduction
was more profound in lower-income countries 27. The aforementioned data
reinforce the concern about a delayed treatment and monitoring agenda
for patients who live in conditions that require continuous health
care. Specifically, regarding the conditions addressed in this study (diabetes
and prenatal), this postponed agenda may bring about an increase
in mortality, infant mortality and disability in 2021.
