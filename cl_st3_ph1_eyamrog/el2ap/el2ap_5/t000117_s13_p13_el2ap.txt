Two and a half decades after the publication of the
report coordinated by Edgar Faure, Jacques Delors (a Socialist Party
politician and former president of the European Commission, from 1985
to 1995), together with other authors, published the report Learning:
the treasure within. It was a report written for UNESCO,
in which they present a diagnosis of global education, in
view of the approaching century and the new challenges brought
about with it. As in the previous report, the authors
suggest policies and strategies for education in the future with
emphasis on the centrality of the subject in the process
of learning and teaching.
