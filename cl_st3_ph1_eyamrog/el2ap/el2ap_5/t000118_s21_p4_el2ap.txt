According to Costa et al. (2015), through the analysis of
morphological characters, Vriesea sceptrum Mez and Vriesea altodaserrae L.B. Sm.
belong to the same clade, along with basal lineages of
Vriesea species. These species can be characterized by the compound
inflorescences, with bracts longer than the peduncle of the branches,
erect and linear to narrowly-oblong petals with apressed apices, and
included stamens as detailed below.
