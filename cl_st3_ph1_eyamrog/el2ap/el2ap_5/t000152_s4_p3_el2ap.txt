All in all, the COVID-19 crisis has rendered more visible
and urgent the need to improve access to higher education
for socially disadvantaged students, also with a view to the
post-pandemic future. In our view the most important task of
all is the universalization of higher education by law, as
already implemented for primary and lower secondary education in 1996.3
It is essential that public policies for the financing of
private higher education are expanded by the State, allowing for
lower tuition fees and increased accessibility for socially disadvantaged students.
