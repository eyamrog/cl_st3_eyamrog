In the report organized by Edgard Faure (1973), we are
presented with an epilogue to the second part, called (In
the manner of a presage) - A Educational City, that,
as it conceives education as an advent, employs the term
presage. As the term is employed, the authors of the
document guide us through at least four meanings around a
given idea of education and, therefore, of what is “educational”:
as something that is outside us and, therefore, of the
order of the unthinkable; as something that is yet to
come and, in this sense still not feasible; and, finally,
as something imminent that will transform the present day education
modes into something much better in this not-so-distant future unveiled
before us. This way of conceiving education as something perpetually
yet to come, coupled with an idea of transcendental schooling
spatiality\ambiance, is not so different from today’s enunciations regarding educational
cities and their educational spaces conceived beyond school ambiances –
these are also something yet to come. Thus, the education
of the future is still to be born from a
present that impregnates it, providing something potentially better for humanity
when it sees the light of day.
