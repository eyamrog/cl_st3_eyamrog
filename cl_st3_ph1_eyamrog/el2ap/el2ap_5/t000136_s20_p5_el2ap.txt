Due to the theoretical domain defined for each dimension, we
decided to group some variables with the dimensions for which
they showed higher discrimination measures. Two referred to dimensions for
which their discrimination measures were not the highest. However, they
were superior to the inertia of the dimension to which
they were associated.
