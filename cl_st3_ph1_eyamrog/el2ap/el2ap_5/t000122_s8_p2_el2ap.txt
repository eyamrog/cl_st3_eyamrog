Procedures have been developed and are used to prevent the
contamination of cultures. Methods for surface decontamination of macroalgae have
used chemical compounds as antibiotics, disinfectant solutions (detergent, povidone iodine,
sodium hypochlorite, sodium hydroxide) and also physical methods as brushing
and washing (e.g. Oliveira et al. 1995, Kawai et al.
2005, Bravin et al. 2006, Shea & Chopin 2007, Fernandes
et al. 2011, Holdt et al. 2014, Saminathan et al.
2014, Yong et al. 2014, Kerrison et al. 2016, Ali
et al. 2018). However, the methods for surface decontamination of
macroalgae must be adjusted for each species (Fernandes et al.
2011), because the effects of procedures, mainly the use of
chemical compounds, can vary among macroalgal species.
