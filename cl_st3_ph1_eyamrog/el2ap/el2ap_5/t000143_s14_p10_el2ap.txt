The variables in this study were grouped into three blocks
to jointly assess the indicators associated with femicide by Pearson's
correlation coefficient (r), where the direction and magnitude of the
associations between the independent variables were assessed using a correlation
matrix: 1) socioeconomic status; 2) demographic status and 3) services
and health status. For this analysis, all variables were standardized
with a mean of zero (0.0) and standard deviation equal
to one (1.0), due to their different dimensions, which could
impair their inclusion and interpretation in the model.
