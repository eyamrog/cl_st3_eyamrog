Freitas and Perez (2016) call camouflaging factors the characteristics of
“invisibility” or “non- existence” of these students, which can affect
their indication, identification, and attendance in the AEE classrooms. The
authors consider three factors: individual (e g., low self-esteem, depression,
perfectionism), familial (e g., low parental expectations, excessive pressure for
academic performance, family conflicts), and environmental (e g., low teacher
expectations, labels pejoratives label such as nerd). They influence the
under-representation and under-performance of these D&T students. Factors that hinder
the manifestation of D&T, which generate low self-confidence, make these
students invisible and, consequently, hide their D&T indicators before teachers
(Freitas & Perez, 2016). The invisibility of these D&T students
is notorious when women (second invisibility) and black (third invisibility).
