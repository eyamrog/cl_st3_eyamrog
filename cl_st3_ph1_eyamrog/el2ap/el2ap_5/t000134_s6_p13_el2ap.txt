Hylodidae species of three genera, Crossodactylus, Hylodes and Megaelosia, are
rheophilic and endemic to the Atlantic Forest (Laia & Rocha
2012), where they are typically found in well-preserved forest fragments
(e.g., Santos-Pereira et al. 2016, Malagoli et al. 2017). These
species are strongly associated with this type of environment, and
depend on streams throughout their life cycle (eggs, tadpoles, and
adults), being thus vulnerable to the loss of riparian forest
(Almeida-Gomes et al. 2014b). These anurans are particularly relevant to
conservation initiatives, given that their effective area of occupation is
normally restricted to water courses, a minor fraction of the
total area of most forests, which makes them especially vulnerable
to extinction (Almeida-Gomes et al. 2014b).
