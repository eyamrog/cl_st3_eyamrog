The second sample was shown to contain less organic matter
than the first, suggesting that the organic matter underwent decomposition,
considering the increment (addition of serapillera) received by the treated
plots. Phosphorus content decreased by 3 mg dm-3 between samples.
It is possible to correlate this result with the presence
of U. brizantha in the soil because, in addition to
being a good host for FMA, this plant has a
high photosynthetic rate and a high demand for phosphorus in
the early stages of its development (Smith & Gianinazzi-Pearson 1988,
Carrenho et al. 2010). Another way to understand the reduction
of phosphorus content between samples is offered by Quesada et
al. (2010): after analyzing soil samples from six South American
countries, including Brazil, they pointed out that the total phosphorus
content may decline due to a loss of dissolved organic
and inorganic phosphorus, caused by weathering processes that produce leaching
or a reduction of soil mass, in addition to the
permanent occlusion of soil minerals.
