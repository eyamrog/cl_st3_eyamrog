Data obtained in this study allowed us to determine procedures
for the removal of contaminating organisms on B. binderi. We
concluded that thalli immersion procedures in 5% liquid detergent and
after in 1% povidone iodine were not effective, whereas immersion
procedures in 5% liquid detergent and after in 0.2% sodium
hypochlorite were effective. Since the RGRs of the thalli immersed
in sodium hypochlorite for 5 minutes significantly differed from the
immersed for 2 minutes and control, whereas the RGRs of
the thalli immersed for 2 minutes did not differ from
the control, we recommend a 2-minute immersion to avoid a
longer exposure of the macroalgae to the compound. We recommend
the physical removal of remaining annelids with sterilized tweezers under
stereoscopic and optical microscopes. The protocol for surface decontamination of
B. binderi is summarized in table 2.
