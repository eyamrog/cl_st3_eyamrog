The floristic survey was carried out at different times of
the year in the natural areas with anthropogenic use. Standard
species recognition techniques were used to identify the taxonomic groups.
Collection trips to the study area were undertaken periodically, taking
account of the climatic conditions and the rotation of cattle
in the different pastures. Phenological observations were made and photographs
of the plants and the habitats where they grow were
taken at the same time. The specimens were herbalized and
the environmental data were recorded. Specific bibliography was used (Correa
1999; Kr√∂pfl et al. 2012; Velasco & Siffredi, 2009; Zuloaga
et al. 2008) for identifying the species and establishing their
biogeographic origin (native / exotic), as well as electronic databases
of the regional flora, such as SIB (www.sib.gov.ar) and the
Catalogue of Flora Argentina, published by Darwinion Botanical Institute (www2.darwin.edu.ar/Proyectos/FloraArgentina/FA.asp
).
