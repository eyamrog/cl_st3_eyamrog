Diffusion test results in wells used the decoction and the
hydroalcoholic extract from C. ferrea leaves to the bacteria are
described in Tables 1 and 2. It has been noticed
that the strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis demonstrated
sensibility at the concentration of 100 mg/mL regarding the decoction
of L. ferrea with halos of 10 and 10.67 mm,
respectively. According to Thomazi, Bertolin and Pinto (2010), such values
were considered satisfactorily, whereas they were sensitive for halos equal
to or larger than 10 mm.
