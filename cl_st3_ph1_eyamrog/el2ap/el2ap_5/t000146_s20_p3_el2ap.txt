When analyzing the citations obtained, two variables allowed us to
assess their relative impact, on the basis of the proportion
of article citations that correspond to the total number of
citations: a) in the national language compared with citations in
any language (Fig. 1-A); and b) citations from the SciELO
CI database compared with all the WoS databases (Fig. 1-B).
