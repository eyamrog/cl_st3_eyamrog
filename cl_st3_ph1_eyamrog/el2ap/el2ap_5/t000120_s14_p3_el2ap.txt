In five of the ten plots, the treatment was implemented
by transposing 1.2 liters per parcel of serapillera from the
second organic sub-horizon of a fragment of Semideciduous Seasonal Forest
at an intermediate stage of regeneration, located at a distance
of seven kilometers from the experimental area. After nine months
following treatment implementation (July 12th, 2018), a new integrated soil
sample was collected for chemical analysis as well as two
samples from each plot for chemical, physical and microbiological analyses.
