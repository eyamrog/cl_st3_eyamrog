Using web-scraping strategies that attempted to target course syllabuses at
Canadian universities, we collected 5,898 documents from nine of Canadaâ€™s
ten provinces (Table 1). Of these, 3,916 proved to be
unique syllabuses for the period 2015-2020. We eliminated 525 of
the syllabuses that referred to assigned readings but did not
identify them (as they were to be found in a
coursepack or on a website). This left 3,391 syllabuses, of
which 2,800 listed readings and/or textbooks, and 591 of them
having no required or assigned items, although these courses sometimes
listed optional and recommended materials for the students.
