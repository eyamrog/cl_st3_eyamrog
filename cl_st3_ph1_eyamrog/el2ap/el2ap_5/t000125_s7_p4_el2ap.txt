After that, other international rankings appeared. The “Webometrics Ranking of
World Universities” (http://www.webometrics.info/en; AGUILLO; ORTEGA; FERNANDEZ, 2008) appeared in 2004,
as well as the ranking “THE-QS”, which would be divided
in “Times Higher Education World University Rankings”, known as “THE”
(https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings) and “QS World University Rankings”, known as “QS” (https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings)
in 2010. In the sequence several other countries created regional
or national rankings (SHIN; TOUTKOUSHIAN, 2011; RIGHETTI, 2015 and 2019).
