COVID-19 also interferes with secondary education in Brazil and will
have repercussions for access to higher education. The Brazilian Association
Higher Education Administrators (2020c) already points out that, for example,
the delay in the realization of the National High School
Examination (ENEM) may generate a “blackout” in the skilled labor
in the future. The transition between school and labour has
already been heavily impacted by the pandemic. The ENEM, an
important public policy governing access to higher education, is the
object of heated political debate in this pandemic year. The
Ministry of Education, contrary to WHO guidelines, retained the schedule
for the tests in November 2020. Several segments of society
opposed this decision and mobilized the justice system to assess
the adequacy of the schedule. Finally, the Ministry of Education
agreed to postpone the ENEM by 30–60 days (National Institute
of Studies and Educational Research Anísio Teixeira 2020).
