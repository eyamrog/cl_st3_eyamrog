In the year 2018, showed in Table 3, there is
again a clear advantage of São Paulo State University (UNESP),
although its score has decreased from 2.81 points in 2017
to 2.49 points in 2018. It still has a good
advantage over the second place, again Federal University of Mato
Grosso, which has an average of Dimensions of 1.57 points,
just 0.01 ahead of its result in 2017. Once again,
after the two first places, all the Universities are below
the mark of 1.0 point and they are very close
to each other, with only 0.29 points of difference between
the third and the last position. Unesp leads again in
all Dimensions, with emphasis in the same two Dimensions: “Teaching
and Learning”, again with 3.25 points in a Dimension where
only Unesp and Federal University of Mato Grosso (2.00 points)
have reported data, as happened in 2017; and “Regional Engagement”,
where Unesp had a large decrease, from 4.00 in 2017
to 2.50 in 2018, while Federal University of Mato Grosso
increased from 1.17 to 1.33. This is the main factor
of the reduction in the difference between the top two
Brazilian Universities.
