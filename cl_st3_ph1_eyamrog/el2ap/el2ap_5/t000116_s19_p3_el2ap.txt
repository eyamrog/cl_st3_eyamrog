The measures presented refer to point estimates. They give us
initial suggestions for describing trends. We performed then a visual
inspection of the temporal trends in the three periods of
study (Figure 2). The illustration of time-series suggests a slight
increase in the trend in the first period, with a
tendency of reduction during the RCAPS, and maintenance of reduction
with PNAB. However, it occurs with a change in the
rate level. We point out that RCAPS reflected a reduction
in rates for most groups. Regarding PNAB, there was a
change in the previous trend. It suggests that, for some
causes, the new PNAB changed the flow for detection and
treatment.
