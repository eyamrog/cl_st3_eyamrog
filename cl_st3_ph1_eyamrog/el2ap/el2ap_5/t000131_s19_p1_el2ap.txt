Gas exchange - The solar radiation level significantly affected stomatal
conductance (gs) and transpiration rate (E) regardless of species, except
at 150 DAT (figure 1 a-d; ANOVA in supplementary material
table S2). E and gs values were lower in plants
grew under higher retention of solar radiation flux (I75). At
150 DAT, gs showed the lowest values when compared to
previous samplings. When species were compared, gs was higher in
M. laevigata than in M. glomerata (supplementary material table S2).
