After meeting with the local UBS team, it was established
that indigenous health agents (IHA) would make direct contact with
the villagers, aiming to increase the adherence of the population
to the study. The studied sampling structure consisted of 396
students aged between 5 and 19 years old, matriculated at
the local indigenous school. The sample size was calculated using
the software StatiDisk Version 8.4, considering the samplying structure, a
95% confidence level, an error of 10% and a prevalence
of 90% for intestinal parasitosis in indigenous villages in Paran√°5,
the required sample of at least 32 people in each
assessment. The population sample consisted of ramdom students whose parents
or guardians voluntarily consented to participate in the research, after
an active search by the local health team. Even though
some indigenous children were included in the two moments of
development of the collections, all were selected randomly.
