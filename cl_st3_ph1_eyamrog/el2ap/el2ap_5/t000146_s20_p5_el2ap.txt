The impact on the native language is also more significant
in the cases of Colombia and Spain. In the case
of Spain, the percentage of articles cited in Spanish, (when
the paper cited is in the same language), is more
than double that of the papers cited in English. The
same is true for the USA, with 42.5 percent of
citations in its own language when it is published in
English, and 14.7 percent when it is only published in
Spanish.
