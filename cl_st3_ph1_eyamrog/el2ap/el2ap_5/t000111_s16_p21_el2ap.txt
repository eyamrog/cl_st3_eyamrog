Therefore, the conclusion is a free relative must be derived
from a restrictive relative clause. This leads us to conclude
that Emonds was partially correct in 1979 in saying that
free relatives have no appositive counterpart. It is clear that
free relatives must be derived via restrictive relatives, but the
data in (1)/(47) show there can be appositive free relative
clauses. How are those appositive free relative clauses characterized?
