In South America, this ranking is still not much popular
and there are only 35 Universities listed in the version
2020: 3 from Argentina, 20 from Brazil, 6 from Chile,
3 from Colombia, 2 from Ecuador and 1 from Peru.
It gives a strong regional leadership to Brazil in this
ranking, besides the small number of Brazilian Universities listed in
the ranking.
