Present species resembles S. dubia (Grunow) Morales & Manoylov, however
according to the authors S. subcapitata (Frenguelli) E.A.Morales has less
lanceolate and silicified valves than the second species. It occurred
in 98% of all core, with a maximum abundance of
15%. S. subcapitata was identified in all subsamples from the
Late Holocene (~4.000 cal. yr BP) up to the core
top (~300 cal. yr BP). Despite the species was already
reported for Brazilian Amazon, in the Negro river (Wetzel 2011),
the present is to be considered the first publish citation
for the Brazilian Amazon.
