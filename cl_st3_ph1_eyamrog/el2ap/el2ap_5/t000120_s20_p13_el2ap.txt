The AMF species richness of the control group (p =
0.91) and the percentage of organic matter in both control
(p = 0.32) and treatment groups (p = 0.81) did
not show significant differences between sampling periods (figure 1). The
wide variety of niches and opportunities in severely degraded areas
also contributes to the greater richness of AMF species at
the beginning of plant succession, according to research conducted in
forest areas at various successional stages in the municipality of
Alc√¢ntara, MA (Reyes et al. 2019). However, the reduction in
AMF richness over time in the treatment group may be
related to reduced fungal niche competition, higher population stability and
a predominance of k-strategist species, with occasionally low levels of
sporulation and better performance in competitive survival, as mentioned by
Pereira et al. (2014). The amount of litter transposed into
the treatment plots was not sufficient to promote a significant
difference in the total percentage of organic matter between samples.
