With most of the scenarios for the likely course of
the pandemic in Brazil being pessimistic, it is vital that
the State be obliged to guarantee access to the internet
as a civil right and the use of the internet
and ICT as a guarantee of continuity and permanence in
higher education. It is up to the State to develop
mechanisms that sustainably boost purchasing power for laptop, desktop, or
tablet computers. It should also be the stateâ€™s obligation to
equip students in vulnerable situations with technological resources, guaranteeing internet
access to synchronous and/or hybrid classes in public HEIs. In
private and public HEIs, the regulatory state must not only
ensure the availability of courses of study, but also guarantee
access for all students, including, if necessary, distributing SIM cards
for internet access.
