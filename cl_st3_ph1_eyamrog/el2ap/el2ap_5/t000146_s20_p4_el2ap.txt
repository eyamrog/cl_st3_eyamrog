The percentages in Fig. 1 were only calculated in cases
where the country had published at least 50 articles in
that language. It can thus be observed that Brazil is
the only country that met this criterion in Portuguese. In
addition, Fig. 1-A shows that Brazil achieves the greatest impact
in its own language (55.7%) by publishing in Portuguese. When
articles are published in English, the impact on its own
language is 47.9%, followed by 34.4% when they are published
in Spanish.
