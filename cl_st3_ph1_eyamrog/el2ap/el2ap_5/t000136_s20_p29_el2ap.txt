This result strengthens the field of agency theory, which underlay
and inspired this study, because it indicates that Governance (presence
of governance mechanisms) positively affected Donations. This confirms Singh and
Indgdal (2007), who discussed best practices for NPO donors in
Nepal, and showed that donors require a range of NPO’s
governance practices for deciding to donate. Thus, governance practices allow
NPO to have an easier access to the donations market,
since they ensure more efficient and effective operations (Greiling and
Stötzer, 2015). This contributes to the improvement of the organization's
reputation in the market of product and factors, and reduces
the information asymmetry and consequent agency costs; therefore, it follows
that agents apply the resources according to the principal’s interests
(mitigating agency problems).
