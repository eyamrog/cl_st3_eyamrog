The first germination count evaluated seven days after sowing indicated
that seeds presented delayed germination when subjected to saline stress.
Gradual decrease in the percentage of normal seedlings was detected
with increased NaCl concentration, observing zero germination from seeds as
from -0.3 MPa of CaCl2 (figure 1 b). This evidence
may be related to the rate of seed water absorption,
which decreases with the reduction of water potential, and the
excess of salts causes cytotoxicity and dehydration of the cells,
reducing the metabolic activity and the synthesis of new tissues
in the seeds due to low water availability (Marcos Filho
2015). Therefore, water becomes less accessible and can reduce the
percentage of seeds that complete the process or completely inhibit
germination (Velázquez-Márquez et al. 2015).
