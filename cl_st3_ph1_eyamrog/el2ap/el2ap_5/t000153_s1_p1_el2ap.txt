This paper examines the stigma of abortion among professionals who
are providers of the service, considering, in particular, the time
when they joined the Network of Healthcare Professionals for the
Right to Decide. This network was created in Argentina at
the end of 2014 by a joint alliance of womenâ€™s
and feminist organizations and healthcare professionals. We have conducted an
exploratory study, of a descriptive type, based on a qualitative
strategy. From 2016 to 2018, we carried out interviews with
healthcare professional, with a view to addressing the relationship between
the stigma of abortion and the healthcare professionals who are
members of the Network. The main results indicate that the
professionals have changed their perception of the stigma of abortion
by becoming members of a group made up of peers
among whom there exists homogeneity regarding their goals, and objectives
in their profession. They admit to gaining confidence to resist
stigma indicators, such as a negative self-perception of the job
done, the fear of information disclosure and the silencing of,
and detachment from fellow professionals. The experience permits to show
how it is possible to resist stigmatization effects, by performing
an active role regarding professional identity.
