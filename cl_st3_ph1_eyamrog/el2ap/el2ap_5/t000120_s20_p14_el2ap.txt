The richness of AMF species in the treatment group during
the dry season may have been influenced by gravimetric humidity
and the presence of Urochloa brizantha. In order to make
the restoration of the area possible, its complete removal is
indispensable; manual or mechanized removal techniques, however, may produce changes
in the physical and microbiological structure of the soil. The
adoption of a chemical approach, in addition to contaminating the
soil, may affect the life cycle of microorganisms, so it
becomes necessary to develop a technique that has minimal impact
on soil structure and composition.
