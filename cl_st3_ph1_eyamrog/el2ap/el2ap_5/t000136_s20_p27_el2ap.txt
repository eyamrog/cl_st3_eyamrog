Figure 2 shows that the direct relationships of the structural
model were significant and caused a positive impact, since path
coefficients assumed positive values. Within the second- order hierarchical model,
it was possible to observe that The Fiscal Council mentions
Governance in a less pronounced way, with a path coefficient
of 0.425. Governance appears in the other dimensions in a
similar way (between 0.631 and 0.727). This may occur because
the Fiscal Council, within the legal environment of the sample
NPO (Brazilian NPO), is not a mandatory body for NPO
or for the companies.
