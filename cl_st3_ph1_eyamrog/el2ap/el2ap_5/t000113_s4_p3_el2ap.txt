To paraphrase Rodr√≠guez (1988): the worst disgrace that can happen
to a woman is to think evil of herself. Consequently,
the history of oppressed black women has created one of
the most disastrous aspects of this process: making them invisible
by nullifying their culture, history, references, talents, abilities, capacities, and
virtues; to the annihilation of any reference that could make
us proud, stimulate or provide the possibility of acceptance of
being different and having their individuality.
