As regards the limitations of the present study, we used
public secondary data from the Ministry of Health. In pandemic
conditions, there may be a relaxation regarding the professionals' commitment
to communicating and updating the data. Some important information regarding
conditions of interest to the topic, such as hypertension, was
not available. The data regarding the number of procedures are
the only ones made available by the Ministry of Health
at the municipal level. In ecological studies, although data do
not directly measure quality and access to care, they can
point to root problems in PHC services. Ecological designs also
have the potential for systematic differences between areas in the
measurement or recording of variables. The estimates do not indicate
a causal effect, and inferences at the individual level cannot
be made from the results of aggregate data, as it
is not a causal interference study.
