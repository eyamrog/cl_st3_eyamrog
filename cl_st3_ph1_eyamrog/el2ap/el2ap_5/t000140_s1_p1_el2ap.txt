In the context of the significant court battles that are
being fought over the potential copyright infringement involved in distributing
the articles and excerpts assigned to students in university courses,
this study analyzes 3,391 course syllabuses (2015-2020) from nine provinces
and 34 universities across Canada. It identifies the types and
proportions of required readings among academic and non-academic sources. Academic
readings are assigned on 26.6 percent of the syllabuses, compared
to 8.3 percent of syllabuses for media articles and trade
book chapters. Among the assigned readings, journal articles lead the
list (with 54.3% of all readings), compared to scholarly book
chapters (33.5%), media articles (6.0%), and trade book chapters (6.3%).
The social sciences lead in the assignment of journal articles
and the humanities in trade book chapters, while science was
least likely to have assigned readings of any type. The
study also found that textbooks are required on a majority
of syllabuses (66.0%), with only minor differences in this proportion
across science, social sciences, and humanities. The data enable a
further analysis at the page level of what the average
student is asked to read annually, which, at the Access
Copyright current tariff of $14.31 (approved by the Canadian Copyright
Board), amounts to a $0.021 per page. This rate is
applied in a proposed new “three-step syllabus rule” that avoids
double-charging students for academic materials (90.1% of readings by pages),
while fairly compensating professional authors and their publishers (9.9%), with
the data analyzed here suggesting a $1.40 annual charge per
student for their assigned readings.
