In terms of a wider domain (SciELO and WoS), Lucio-Arias,
Velez-Cuartas and Leydesdorff [13] compiled 79,924 items to analyze international
cooperation and noted that the LAC papers in Spanish and
Portuguese remained the main languages for communication. In the view
of the authors, this is one of the reasons why
researchers from LAC countries may have a limited participation in
collaborative networks. In addition, it should be remembered that, as
Luukkonen, Persson and Sivertsen [14] state the stronger the scientific
infrastructure of a country, the lower the degree of international
collaboration. For this reason, the rate of international collaboration in
Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic is above 80%,
while in the case of the more prolific Argentina, Brazil,
Chile and Mexico, it is between 30 and 40% [15].
In general, every country is seeking to increase its rate
of international collaboration.
