Valves lanceolate to rhombic-lanceolate, apices rostrate, axial area narrow, linear,
and slightly widened in the central area. Raphe slightly curved.
Striae parallel, slightly radiating towards the ends. Stigma positioned at
the end of the longest central striae. This taxon presents
morphological features similar to Gomphonema naviculoides W.Smith, regarding the valve
shape. However, both species differ in valve dimensions and striae
density. According to Reichardt (2015), G. naviculoides presents 35-45 µm
in length, and 7.8-9.5 µm in width, with 12-14 striae
in 10 µm. Due to the absence of ultrastructural details
(SEM), we decided to retain Gomphonema sp. as a distinct
taxon. It was present in 8% of the core samples,
and reached 2.3% maximum abundance. It occurs during the Late
Holocene from ~1.322 cal. yr BP.
