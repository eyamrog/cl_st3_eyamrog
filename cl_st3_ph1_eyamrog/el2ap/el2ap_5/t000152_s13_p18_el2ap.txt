Efficiency and accessibility of technology is not the only challenge
HEIs face in resuming their courses; they must also contend
with resistance among teachers who see in this modality a
threat of increased precarity and loss of autonomy and control.
Many teachers in higher education also feel unprepared to handle
digital technologies and platforms. Studies point out that there are
only few subjects involving ICT in teacher education (Lopes and
Fürkotter 2016); others discuss the teachers’ concerns about the absence
of physical interaction in distance education (Carmo and Franco 2019);
critically examine the negative impact of the work overload on
teachers (Chaquime and Mill 2016), and identify the fear of
not knowing how to properly deal with technologies and not
meeting the expectations of students (Rosa 2013).
