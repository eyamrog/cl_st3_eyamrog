The transposition of litter from the Semideciduous Seasonal Forest to
the soil disturbed with Urochloa brizantha did not promote increased
richness in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus species, and did not facilitate
the colonization of plant species that are useful in the
ecological restoration process, thus suggesting that, before actions aimed at
recovering an area are taken, the grass must be removed
completely.
