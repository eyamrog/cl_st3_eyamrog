Vriesea altobocainensis can also related to Vriesea altodaserrae, a species
that inhabits the Serra do Mar mountain range, from sea
level to the highest lands of Paraná, Santa Catarina and
São Paulo, occuring also in Serra da Bocaina. Both species
co-occur, with Vriesea altodaserrae being very common in the region.
Vriesea altobocainensis is rarer, with the individuals inhabiting, in general,
the forest canopy, which makes it of more difficult visualization,
and therefore, harder to estimate population sizes. The two species
share similar general morphology, especially in terms of the shape
and size of the rosettes, the predominant red color of
the primary bracts, and the distichous flowers with yellow sepals
and petals. However, Vriesea altobocainensis presents more robust inflorescence branches,
lower in number (10-21), thicker red rachillas, densely aggregated flowers,
and internodes with 0.8-1.1 cm long. In addition, the primary
bracts of the upper portion of the rachis are orbicular
to broadly-ovate, 6-8 cm wide; floral bracts are red or,
when at the apex of the branch, red and yellow
at the apex, orbicular to broadly-ovate, 2-2.8 cm wide. Vriesea
altodaserrae has more delicate inflorescence branches, more numerous (20-30), thinner
green to greenish-yellow rachillas, and internodes 1.5-2 cm long. The
primary bracts of the upper portion of the rachis are
broadly-ovate, 3- 6 cm long; floral bracts are yellow, ovate,
1.4-2 cm wide (figure 3).
