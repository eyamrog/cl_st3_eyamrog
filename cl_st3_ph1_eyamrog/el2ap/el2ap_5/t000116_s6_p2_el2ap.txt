The slighter decrease in certain groups suggests less immediate impact
due to conditions that require specialized attention, such as epilepsy
and lung diseases. The exception to this rule is the
conditions already traditionally discussed at this level of care, which
has a referenced network, such as asthma25,26. On the other
hand, the behavior of chronic hospitalizations such as diabetes reinforces
their condition as a sensitive cause to the provision of
organized PHC services27. We believe that the effect on these
chronic conditions tends to manifest itself over time19.
