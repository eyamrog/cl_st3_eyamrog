Dimensions of Gomphonema brasiliensoides Metzeltin, Lange-Bertalot & García-Rodriguez are greater
than those of Gomphonema brasiliense Grunow (Metzeltin et al. 2005:
L: 24.0-60.0 μm, W: 6.6-9 μm and L: 22.0-44.0 μm,
W: 5.5-6.7 μm; respectively). It was found in 13% of
the core samples and reached 2% maximum abundance. The species
is identified from samples from the end of the Mid-Holocene
to the core top (~3.774 cal. yr BP to the
present day). Present investigation represents the first report of this
species occurrence in the Brazilian Amazon.
