Testing is performed based on the equation that the coefficient
(δ) before the variable of 𝑦𝑡−1 is equal to or
smaller than zero. In other words, the null hypothesis indicates
that there is no cointegrating relationship, and the alternative hypothesis
indicates the presence of a cointegrating relationship. What we need
to do is to estimate this model and 𝑦𝑡−1 test
the coefficient before the variable. variable.
