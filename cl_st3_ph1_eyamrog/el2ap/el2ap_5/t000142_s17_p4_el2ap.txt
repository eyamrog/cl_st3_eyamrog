Linearity Tests are structured upon the models based on smooth
transitions typed the STAR (Smooth Transition Autoregressive). These tests are
a priori test for the transition to the STAR type
test. Unlike other tests, these tests, which were introduced to
the literature by Harvey, do not have any prerequisites. Considering
the main advantage of not being affected by stationarity levels,
Harvey & Leybourne (2007) and Harvey, Leybourne & Xiao (2008)
Tests were administered for testing the linearity.
