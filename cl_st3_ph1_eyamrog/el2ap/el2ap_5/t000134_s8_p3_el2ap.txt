In addition to the PNT, two other large parks are
found within the urban zone of Rio de Janeiro –
the Parque Estadual da Pedra Branca and the Parque Natural
Municipal da Serra do Mendanha (PNM Serra do Mendanha). The
PNT has a long history of scientific research, first being
visited by naturalists during the 19th and 20th centuries. These
naturalists described a number of amphibian species based on specimens
collected in this area, including Aplastodiscus albofrenatus (Lutz, 1924), Dendrophryniscus
brevipollicatus Jiménez de la Espada 1870, Ischnocnema guentheri (Steindachner, 1864),
Ischnocnema octavioi (Bokermann, 1965), Phasmahyla guttata (Lutz, 1924), and Scinax
trapicheiroi (A. Lutz and B. Lutz, 1954). More recently, herpetofaunal
researches in the park included studies of the ecology, natural
history or bioacoustics of some taxa (e.g., Heyer 1973, Hepp
& Carvalho-e- Silva 2011, Dorigo et al. 2014, Machado et
al. 2016, Hepp et al. 2017, Silva-e-Souza 2019, Guarabyra et
al. 2020). Introductory lists of amphibian species (Carvalho-e-Silva et al.
2008) and reptiles (Mocelin 2008) were compiled for the management
plan of this conservation unit (ICMBIO 2008), although, up to
the present time, no systematic inventory has been produced. Given
this, we inventoried the herpetofauna of the PNT over a
three-year period, using intensive sampling to obtain species composition and
estimates of the richness and abundance of the park’s amphibians
and reptiles. We supplemented our inventory with records of occurrence
obtained from herpetological collections and species reintroduction programs in PNT.
