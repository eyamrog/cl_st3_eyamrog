Kapetanios, Shin & Snell (KSS) (2006)42 enhanced the Engle-Granger Cointegration
Test and introduced it to the literature by applying this
test to nonlinear models. The alternative hypothesis stating that there
is a nonlinear long-term relationship between the variables is tested
against the basic hypothesis stating that there is no cointegration
relationship.
