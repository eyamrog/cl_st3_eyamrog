The results of the present study show a very uneven
distribution of the rates of femicide per 100 thousand women
in the Sergipeâ€™s municipalities in the period studies, whose rates
standardized ranged between 11.74 death/100,000 women and 87.80 death/100,000 women
(Figure 1). In order to adjust the differences in the
distribution by sex of the population and, consequently, a possible
confounding effect of the latter on the rates of feminicide
in the municipalities of Sergipe, the direct method of standardization
of these rates was employed 26, since there is a
possibility of an increase or reduction of the female population
to the detriment of the male population in some municipalities.
In addition, the selection of women's deaths from aggression with
a feminicide proxy variable could overestimate this phenomenon. However, a
percentage of underreporting deaths of 24% in the Northeast region
of Brazil should be expected 2,17,27, which could compensate for
underreporting or even the ill-defined diagnosis of the cause of
death due to female aggression.
