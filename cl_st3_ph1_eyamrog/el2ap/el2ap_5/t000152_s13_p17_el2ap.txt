In addition to employment and income issues, 8% of participants
in the Brazilian Association of Higher Education Administrators (2020b) survey
stated that they intend to discontinue their studies because their
HEI has not made its courses available through distance mode.
This reflects the fact that many public HEIs do not
have adequate capacity to support the use of ICT, digital
platforms and virtual learning environments for maintaining tuition during this
crisis. In general, ICT infrastructure is inadequate in many public
and private Brazilian HEIs. The Brazilian Association of Distance Education
has compiled in a kind of dossier several subjects dealing
with distance education and COVID-19. In one of them, Fernanda
Furuno (2020) reflects on the possibility of HEI without online
teaching platforms while Tomazinho (2020) relates the difficulties of HEI
with the broadband service offered in Brazil. Notwithstanding Resolution 343/2020
(Federative Republic of Brazil 2020), which allows for the use
of ICT to deliver university curricula remotely, the crisis has
revealed that Brazilâ€™s public education system, like many others around
the world, was quite unprepared for a switch to distance
learning modalities (Kerrers 2020; Adnam and Anwar 2020).
