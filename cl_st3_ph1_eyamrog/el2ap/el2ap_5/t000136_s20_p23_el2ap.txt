In this research, the governance construct only comprised the internal
mechanisms. Regarding the external mechanisms, the Market of Products and
Factors and the Political, Legal and Regulatory System, we used
them to delimit the object of empirical investigation (similar to
a control variable); on the other hand, the main effects
of this research fall on the Donations Market, that is,
the impact of Governance on the Donations with donor restrictions.
We also used a specificity related to the political, legal
and regulatory system (NPO Certification) to check a potential moderating
effect on the relationship between Governance and Donations. Thus, we
explored the set of governance dimensions.
