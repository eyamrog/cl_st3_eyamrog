It is in this regard that there is a need
for accurate data from the land destined for livestock production
in order to make good use of the resources of
natural vegetation. For this reason, the present contribution aims to
analyze the spontaneous plant species that grow on the land
used for extensive cattle production in the Middle Valley of
RÃ­o Negro. Knowledge of the vegetation will facilitate the design
of conservation strategies on a local scale.
