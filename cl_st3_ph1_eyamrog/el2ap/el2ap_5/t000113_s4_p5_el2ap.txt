Finally, considering that teachers are the professionals who theoretically know
and therefore be in the best conditions to observe and
refer black D&T students to the school's AEE (both their
family members and friends generally do not have this knowledge).
That means the possibility that these students never develop their
natural abilities and update their talents, and therefore remain immersed
in the invisibility that represents a series of cumulative disadvantages
for them. The research is in progress. However, preliminary results
point to a fourth invisibility in Brazil: that of gifted
black women from the northern region of the country.
