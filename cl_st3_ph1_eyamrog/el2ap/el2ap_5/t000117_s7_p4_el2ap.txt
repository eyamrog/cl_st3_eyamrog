We have divided this text, therefore, into five parts. In
the first part we study the learning society, highlighting the
centrality of ICT in the studentsâ€™ learning process, who are
increasingly inflated protagonists in alternative pedagogies. In the second part,
we scrutinize the reports by Faure and Delors in order
to highlight that a flexibilization of learning spaces beyond schooling
institutions was already announced in both documents. In the third
part, we present the impact of both reports on the
Brazilian National Education Guidelines and Basic Law (LDBEN 9.394/1996). In
the fourth part, we present the discourse of the dematerialization
of school within a parallel discoursive framework, namely, the demurring
of childhood and the school in the forest. Finally, in
the last part, we bring in an interview with Noah
Webster Sobe, Senior Project Officer of the Research and Foresight
in UNESCO`s Education program, in order to discuss the deterritorialization7
and reterritorialization of school, as well as it demmuring and
dematerialization, above all in face of the COVID-19 pandemic, whose
effects have effected new discourses around the places of learning.
