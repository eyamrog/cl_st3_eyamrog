These livestock practices and all the related tasks (clearing of
the land, construction of roads, demarcation of pastures, installation of
water supplies and fences, among others), contribute to an ecological
imbalance. These disturbances facilitate degradation processes and result in the
introduction and invasion of exotic species that lead to a
decrease and fragmentation in the populations of native species (Derner
et al. 2009; Milchunas & Lauenroth 1993). At the same
time, several of these species contain various chemical components potentially
toxic to cattle, which cause a deterioration in the natural
pastures (Bisigato et al. 2005; Krikor & Hierro 2011; Marino
2008; Peralta and Klich in press).
