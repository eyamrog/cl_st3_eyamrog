Biomass values of the thalli were measured weekly on analytical
balance during the replace of the culture medium. Before weighing,
thalli were gently blotted dry with paper towels to remove
excess water. Relative growth rates (RGR) were calculated at the
end of the cultivation and were estimated using the formula
recommended by Yong et al. (2013): [(Wt/Wi)1/t - 1] x
100, being Wt the wet weight after t days, Wi
the initial wet weight, and t is the cultivation period.
The wet weights and RGRs were measured as proxies of
thalli health.
