The population of Diploneis elliptica (Kützing) Cleve var. elliptica showed
valve morphology and striae density similar to the ones illustrated
by Krammer & Lange-Bertalot (1986: fig. 108: 1- 4). However,
samples analyzed from the Xingu river showed specimens smaller than
those described for the species (L: 20-130 μm). It was
present in 2.6% of the core samples, and reaches 3%
maximum abundance. D. elliptica var. elliptica was identified from samples
corresponding to the Late Holocene (~1.730 to 560 cal. yr
BP). This is the first citation of the species presence
in the Brazilian Amazon.
