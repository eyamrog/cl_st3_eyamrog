In the second part of this report, the guiding principles
for education are laid out, conceived as “the four pillars
of education”, grounded on some ideas by Faure and collaborators
(1973), especially about educational needs in face of the globalized
world and the advent of new information and communication technologies.
The four pillars are formulated around the enunciations “learning to
know”, “learning to do”, “learning to live together” and “learning
to be”. The first is related to the acquisition of
the “tools for comprehension” (Delors et al., 1998, p. 90);
the second regards the capacity to “being able to act
on the involving world” (Delors et al., 1998, p. 90);
the third relates to the ability to “participate and cooperate
with others in all human activities” (Delors et al., 1998,
p. 90); and the fourth pillar would integrate all previous
three.
