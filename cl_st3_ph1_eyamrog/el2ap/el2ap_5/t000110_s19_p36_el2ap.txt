This taxa resembles Stauroneis sylviabonillae Metzeltin, Lange-Bertalot & García-Rodríguez in
regard to the lanceolate valve shape, however, Stauroneis sp. has
smaller valves dimensions and higher striae density than those described
in Metzeltin et al. (2005: L:103-120 µm, W:20-22 µm, S:15-16
in 10µm).Moreover, S. sylviabonillae has proximal raphe fissures slightly deflected,
such feature isn’t observed Stauroneis sp. Material examined also differs
from Stauroneis anceps Ehrenberg (1843: 291-445 105) due to its
narrow, rostrate, and long apices (Bahls 2011). In the present
study, Stauroneis sp.1 was present in 5% of the core
samples, reaching 2% maximum abundance. It occurred in samples corresponding
to the Late Holocene (~2.909 cal. yr BP).
