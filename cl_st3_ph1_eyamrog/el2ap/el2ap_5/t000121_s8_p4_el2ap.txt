People with suspected COVID-19 were more likely to have depressive
symptoms and lower quality of life than those without the
disease (Nguyen et al., 2020). Regarding anxiety, its concept is
based on a tripartite structure formed by worry, fear, and
uncertainty, which are present in the current pandemic situation (Barari
et al., 2020; Dong & Bouey, 2020; Faro et al.,
2020; Kong et al., 2020). The current context is marked
by the experience of uncertainty in terms of an effective
vaccine or treatment of COVID-19 and expectations regarding the end
of this pandemic. Simultaneously, there is fear of contagion, of
death itself or death of significant ones, besides social isolation.
Finally, the third facet of anxiety is fueled by worry
about what is expected for the post-pandemic future.
