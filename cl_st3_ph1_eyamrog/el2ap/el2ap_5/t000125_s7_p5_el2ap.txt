In the scope of those discussions, a different concept appeared
in Europe and a multidimensional ranking was proposed (VAN VUGHT;
ZIEGELE, 2012). From this first idea, the "U-Multirank" was created
(https://www.umultirank.org/). It measures the performance of Academic Institutions in five
Dimensions: (1) Teaching and Learning, (2) Research, (3) Knowledge Transfer,
(4) International Orientation and (5) Regional Engagement. Each Dimension is
evaluated using several Indicators. Based on that, the user can
evaluate the Universities in each Indicator or grouped in families,
focusing in the most important aspects for each user.
