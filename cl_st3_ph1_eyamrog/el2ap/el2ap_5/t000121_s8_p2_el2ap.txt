Currently, the world is facing the sixth PHEIC with the
outbreak of the new human coronavirus (PAHO & OMS, 2020).
In total, there are seven human coronaviruses, three of which
can cause severe respiratory tract infections: SARS-COV, MERS-COV, and the
current SARS-COV-2, which causes COVID-19 (PAHO & WHO, 2020). Responsible
for over one million deaths by early November 2020 (em
02/11: 1.204.003), COVID-19 has made countries around the world adopt
isolation and social distancing measures to prevent further contagion and
contain its progress, while effective forms of prevention and treatment
are researched (Faro et al., 2020; PAHO & WHO, 2020).
