It was observed that this ranking is not very popular
in Brazil, with only 20 Brazilian Institutions listed in this
ranking. The same is true for South America, which has
only 35 Universities listed. Efforts should be done to improve
those reports, since this ranking is increasing in popularity in
the world.
