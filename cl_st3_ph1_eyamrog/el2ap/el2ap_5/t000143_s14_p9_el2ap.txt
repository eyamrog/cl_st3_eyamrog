Univariate exploratory analysis of spatial data was performed to investigate
global spatial autocorrelation of femicide rates in Sergipe's municipalities using
the Moran I index, under the assumptions of normality and
randomization 21. The distribution of Moran index values varies between
-1,0 and +1,0 and tests whether connected areas present greater
similarity in relation to the studied indicator, than would be
expected in a random pattern. Thus, spatial autocorrelation measures the
number of nearby objects compared to other nearby objects using
the Moran I index, which can be classified as positive,
negative and without spatial autocorrelation.
