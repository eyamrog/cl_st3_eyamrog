Positive effects of PHC coverage have been documented in recent
studies, using selected impact health indicators, such as mortality in
special groups (children, chronic disease)13,14. Another indicator often used for
monitoring PHC quality is rate of hospitalizations due to Ambulatory
Care Sensitive Conditions (ACSC)15. It represents a set of health
problems for which the significant action of PHC would decrease
the risk of hospitalizations. According to Macinko et al16, this
indicator is seldom used to evaluate services in low- and
middle-income countries. High rates of ACSC can be related to
problems of access, coverage, or low efficiency in this level
of care17,18. Data reliability and accessibility in public databases favors
the use of ACSC hospitalization rate to assess PHC services,
focusing on implementation and coverage effect, as shown in some
authorâ€™s recent work19,20.
