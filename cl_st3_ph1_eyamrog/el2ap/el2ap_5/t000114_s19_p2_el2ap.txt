Altitudinal zones II and III exhibited the largest number of
families, 12 and 17, respectively (figure 4). Some of the
families were only present in one altitudinal zone: Pterobryaceae (1sp)
in zone I; Orthotrichaceae (2sp), Calymperaceae and Rhacocarpaceae (1 sp)
in zone II; Mniaceae (2 sp), Phyllogoniaceae, Pilotrichaceae and Neckeraceae
(1 sp) in zone III; Hedwigiaceae (1 sp) in zone
IV. The family Bryaceae was the most common, being present
in all zones, but with greater richness in zone III
with a total of four species. Below is a diagnostic
characterization for endemic and new citations (*), listed in alphabetical
order by family.
