It is important consider than the largest portion of the
Brazilian population is concentrated in urban zone. Brazil has more
than 5,000 municipalities that are small cities majority or small
ville where internet transmition signal are inadequate for some reasons
how be far from large urban centers where transmission by
optic fibre is better available than small cities, fewer still
in rural zone or radio that in some cases do
not have in rural zone too. Moreover, being in urban
centers does not mean having access to broadband internet, because
in the peripheral regions the service may be more unstable.
According to Lis (2020) and Yuge (2020), the National Telecommunications
Agency is receiving a rising number of complaints about the
lack of broadband internet provision in Brazil. Cardoso (2020) reports
about the difficulty of accessing broadband internet on the outskirts
of SÃ£o Paulo, the largest urban center in the economically
most developed region of the country, where, according to the
SEADE Foundation (2020), more than 7,500,000 people have never had
access to the Internet. Soprana (2020) states that there are
more than 70 million Brazilians without internet access in Brazil.
