The legitimizing myths of stratified social hierarchies have power in
people's subconscious because they are shared collectively among group members
and society as a whole (Moscovici, 1984). In the school
context, education is grounded in a stratified social structure in
which, despite imminent failure, practices that do not work continue
to be implemented by teachers and carried out by students
(Acosta, 2019). Therefore, in this context, teachers might not be
aware of the role these myths play in perpetuating the
status quo (Milner & Laughter, 2015).
