Data collection, identification and analysis - Authorization for the collection
of specimens was given by the Instituto Chico Mendes de
Conservação da Biodiversidade (number 47090-4). The data collection was carried
out during three days in May 2015, along the main
access road to the camps and on the trails to
some waterfalls. The main road is 9 km long and
partially paved, this route can be done by car. We
visited the waterfalls “Aurélio” and “Sete pilões” along hiking trails
that can be considered narrow and of moderate difficulty, with
extensions by 1000 and 210 m, respectively (ICMBio accessed 12/02/2020a).
The collection was conducted with the aim to capture the
diversity of species at each site, that is, there was
no exhaustive search of specimens - species repeated within one
site were intentionally not collected again and not abundantly sampled.
The plants were collected manually or with a spatula on
all available substrates. In total we collected 125 samples. The
samples were stored in paper bags according to the methodology
proposed by Yano (1984) also with environmental information such as
degree of sun exposure and geographical coordinates. The colonized substrate
classification is based on Robbins (1952) with modifications: corticicolous (trunk
or living branch), epixilous (trunk, fallen branch or leaves), epiphyllous
(upon leaves), rupicolous (upon rocks), terricolous (on soil) and others
(e.g. termite mound, anthropized substrates). For identification we used specific
literature such as Reese (1993), Sharp et al. (1994), Buck
(1998), Gradstein et al. (2001), Vaz-Imbassahy et al. (2008), Peralta
& Yano (2010), Costa et al. (2010) and Costa (2015).
The classification adopted for the mosses in this work is
in agreement with Goffinet et al. 2009, except by the
Sematophyllaceae family, following Carvalho-Silva et al. (2017). Taxa names was
checked and corrected using the Tropicos® database (Tropicos 2015). Data
of global distribution and of the Brazilian states, as well
as the phytogeographic domains are in accordance with the information
available in Flora do Brasil 2020 (2021), being verified in
the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (Gbif 2021) and Splink (Splink
2021) databases, once the collection information is reliable as, at
least, identified by specialist and more than one collected. The
information regarding the conservation status and the endemism of the
species are in specific literature (Yano & Peralta 2007, Martinelli
& Moraes 2013, Flora do Brasil 2020 2021).
