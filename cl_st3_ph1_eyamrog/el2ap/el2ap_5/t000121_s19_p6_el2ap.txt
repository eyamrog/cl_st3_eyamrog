Finally, in the outcome related to having both set of
symptoms (fourth model), those who were up to 24 years
old were two times more likely to present them in
relation to both the group between 31 and 39 years
old and in relation to those who were over 39
years old (OR = 0.5; 1/OR = 2). Not having
a steady income and perceiving oneself as ill increased the
chances of having anxious and depressive symptoms in relation to
those having a steady income (OR = 1.3) and who
perceived themselves as healthy (OR = 2.4). Those who scored
above the mean on the meta-worry scale were about 13
times more likely to have both set of symptoms than
those who scored up to the mean (OR = 12.7).
