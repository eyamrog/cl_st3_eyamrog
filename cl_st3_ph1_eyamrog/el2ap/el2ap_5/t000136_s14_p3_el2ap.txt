Considering the significance level of 0.05, statistical power of 0.8,
effect size of 0.35, and six predictors, the minimum sample
size were 46 observations. As we carried out the moderation
evaluation through multigroup analysis (two groups), we considered as minimum
size 92 observations, or two groups of 46. Then we
developed the sampling plan (Table 1).
