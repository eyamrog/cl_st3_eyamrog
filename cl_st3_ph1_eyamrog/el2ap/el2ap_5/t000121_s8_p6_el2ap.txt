The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 is inducing fear, uncertainty, and
worry, which lead to the need for a timely understanding
of the repercussions on peopleâ€™s health status and psychological adjustment.
In Brazil, for instance, no information has yet been found
on the psychological impact and mental health of the general
public in the initial period of the COVID- 19 epidemic,
which corresponded to March 2020 (Duarte, Santo, Lima, Giordani, &
Trentini, in press). This is especially relevant due to the
uncertainties surrounding an outbreak of incomparable magnitude in recent history,
which makes it pertinent to understand how this situation has
affected the mental health of the population at the beginning
of the period of social isolation and quarantine due to
COVID-19. Based on information from that initial moment, possibly more
effective actions can be undertaken with a preventive character or
even better structuring of health care throughout the crisis.
