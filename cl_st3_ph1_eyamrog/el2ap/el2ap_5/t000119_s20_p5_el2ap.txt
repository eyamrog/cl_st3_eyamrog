Under water deficit conditions, one of the primary effects triggered
on plants is cell dehydration, which consequently causes a reduction
in pressure potential (turgor) and cell volume. This condition triggers
side effects, such as ion concentration in cytosol, becoming cytotoxic
because the ions cause protein denaturation and membrane destabilization, which
may lead to cell death (Taiz et al. 2017). In
seeds, the main effects observed are decreased germination percentage, increased
average time for germination and reduction of primary root and
hypocotyl (DemontiÃªzo et al. 2016, Freire e et al. 2018).
