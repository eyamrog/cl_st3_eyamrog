Microorganisms are becoming resistant to the commonly used chemical disinfectants.
Thereby, these chemical products should now be replaced by natural
ones. In this context, this research aimed to evaluate the
disinfectant activity of the extract and decoction of Libidibia ferrea
leaves in different surfaces. Thus, two forms of juc√° leaf
extraction (decoction and hydroalcoholic extraction) were tested through the diffusion
disk technique from Kirby and Bauer, growth curve, acceptability test
with the population, and surface test. Results showed sensibility to
decoction of S. aureus and E. faecalis strains; however, for
the extract, the strains that demonstrated sensibility were S. aureus,
P. aeruginosa, Micrococcus spp. Corynebacterium spp., and S. Typhimurium in
the diffusion disk test. A reduction of the bacterial charge
throughout the growth curve was seen through the absorbance values
after 24 hours to the strains of E. coli, E.
feacalis, Micrococcus spp. and K. pneumoniae in the concentration of
100 mg/mL of the decoction and extract. Regarding the surfaces
test, there was a reduction in the bacterial charge in
all tested strains. Therefore, the L. ferrea may be used
as an effective alternative disinfectant measure.
