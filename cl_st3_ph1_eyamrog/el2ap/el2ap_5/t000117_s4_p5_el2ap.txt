Finally, the fourth and last aspect regards the gains and
losses we would incur as we renounce the school as
we knew and experienced prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. If
on the one hand the discourse around the “learning society”
brings about the promise that learning can at last become
“personalized, which means that the pupil in contact with new
technologies learns what, when, where and as much as he
or she wants, regulated chiefly by personal inclinations and needs
of adapting to a world in constant change; on the
other hand, a deterritorialized school has no way to secure
something that the school, since it has been established as
an institution in charge of all children’s education, sought to
secure: the regular living together of the same group of
children with their teachers, adults in charge of their education
day in, day out. This living together relied on a
specific space and time that allowed it to happen, so
as to render possible a shared quotidian routine, from where
one could give meanings to the experiences lived and was
able to know the others and the world, and constitute
oneself as subject in the flesh.
