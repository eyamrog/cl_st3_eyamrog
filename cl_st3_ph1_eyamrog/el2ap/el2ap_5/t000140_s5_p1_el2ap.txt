In determining a fair price to charge for the use
of published materials assigned in Canadian university courses, a number
of considerations need to be taken into account. From our
perspective, the first of these is that the journal articles
and scholarly book chapters – which account for 90.1 percent
of the pages assigned to students (Table 6) – form
a distinctive scholarly publishing economy that has operated at a
remove from that of trade publishing for centuries. We believe
that distinctions between scholarly and trade publishing warrant an alternative
approach to the handling of university course readings that we
wish to illustrate using the data assembled here. This bears
on the 2020 Federal Court of Appeal ruling on York
v. Access Copyright, which noted that “York did not justify
[its claim to ‘fair dealing’] beyond invoking education as an
allowable purpose” (YU, 2020, 258). We want to provide a
more thorough justification for limiting and tailoring the claims of
fair dealing for university course readings based on the distinctions
between the scholarly and trade publishing economies. We recognize that
this will call for an agreement over conventions and standards
for the assignment of reading types, based in part on
distinguishing between academic and professional authorship. To that end, we
are proposing a “three-step syllabus rule” for dealing fairly with
the readings assigned to students in university courses. The technical
aspects of the three proposed steps are described in the
appendix, with a summary here:
