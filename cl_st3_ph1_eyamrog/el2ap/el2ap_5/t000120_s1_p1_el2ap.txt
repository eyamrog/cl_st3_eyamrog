(The influence of forest litter on the endomicorritic fungi community
in a natural regeneration area in São Paulo State, Brazil).
Natural areas of high biological diversity are being degraded to
meet man's need to convert them to various uses. The
ecological restoration through litter transposition enables for the reestablishment of
ecological processes and may contribute to the increase of microorganisms.
It aimed to evaluate the influence of litter on the
community of mycorrhizal fungi in an area of Cabreúva, São
Paulo State, Brazil. Ten plots were delimited, five control and
five treatment. Soil samples were collected during two distinct periods
for physical, chemical and microbiological analysis. Results indicated that the
edaphic conditions of the place are consistent with the presence
of AMF; also, the transposed organic matter did not increase
species richness and did not facilitate the colonization of plant
species, whereas gravimetric humidity and grass may have influenced species
richness.
