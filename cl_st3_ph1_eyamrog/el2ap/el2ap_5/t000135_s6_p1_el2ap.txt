The findings showed a significant reduction in the availability of
medical appointments and the performance of procedures involving prenatal and
diabetes care between the periods compared. Considering the total number
of procedures, all months (from February to December) witnessed a
decrease in the rate of procedures. This may be explained
by the large number of health professionals having been redeployed
to combat the pandemic, not to mention that health professionals
run a higher risk of contracting Sars-Covid-19 than the general
public and, consequently, being unable to work.12 In addition, the
fear of contamination has caused individuals to seek health services
less frequently, especially in emergency situations. Thus, elective treatments have
been postponed. 13 To corroborate this, no organized action by
PHC to confront Covid-19 has been implemented at the national
level in Brazil. Similarly, monitoring and control actions have not
been directed towards people with health conditions that need assistance
on an ongoing basis. These may be some of the
reasons for the results observed in this study.12
