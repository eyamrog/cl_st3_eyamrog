Due to the disparity in the quality of teaching between
public and private secondary schools, the ENEM was not a
guarantee of access to and student retention in higher education.
To address the situation, in 2004 the University for All
Program (ProUni) was created, offering scholarships of up to 100%
for private HEIs (Ministry of Education of Brazil 2018b). FIES
was also expanded, opening up greater access to socially vulnerable
young people, and also covering up to 100% of tuition
costs. Funding through ProUni or FIES was conditional on taking
the ENEM.
