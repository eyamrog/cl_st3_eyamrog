To arrive at a rough estimate of the costs involved
for the course readings on this set of syllabuses, the
average page count for each reading type was calculated (Table
6). This suggests that students were assigned 82.6 pages per
syllabus on average for all of the readings. With students
taking an average of 8.2 courses a year, the 82.6
pages per syllabus amounts to 677.6 pages of assigned readings
a year. If one then takes the Access Copyright annual
tariff that was approved by the Copyright Board of Canada,
at $14.31 per student, the 677.6 pages a year works
out to a payment of $0.021 per page for the
assigned readings across all types.6
