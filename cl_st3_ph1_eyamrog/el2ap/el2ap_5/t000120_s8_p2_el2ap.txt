The purpose of the nucleation technique is to find various
elements (microorganisms and seeds, among others) in forest areas, and
then move them to the disturbed area in order to
create small nuclear habitats that will produce environmental heterogeneity over
time and space. These nuclei function as ecological triggers for
the natural regeneration process, and allow for the arrival of
living organisms that can establish ecological interactions (Reis et al.
2010, Reis et al. 2014). The literature describes several nucleating
techniques used in the restoration process, such as soil transposition,
direct seeding, hydrosowing, transposition of branches, artificial perches, and the
planting of seedlings within high diversity islands (Reis et al.
2003).
