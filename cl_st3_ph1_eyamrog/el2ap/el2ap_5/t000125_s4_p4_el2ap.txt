Brazilian Institutions increased the percentages of data available from a
minimum of 38.48% in 2018 to 44.71% in the years
2019 and 2020. It is an increase, but the numbers
are still below the world average of 54.46% in 2020,
the average of the Spanish Institutions (86.15%) and the average
of the best 300 performers in Europe (85.72%), both also
measured in 2020.
