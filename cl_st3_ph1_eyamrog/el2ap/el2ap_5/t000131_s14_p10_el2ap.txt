Experimental design and statistical analysis - The effects of irradiance
interference, species, and their interactions were evaluated using analysis of
variance (two-way ANOVA) using the SYSTAT software package (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL) (P < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant).
Significant effects were further analyzed using Tukey's test. The ANOVA
included two species (M. glomerata and M. laevigata) and four
levels of sunlight retention of solar radiation flux treatment: 0%
(I0), 25% (I25), 50% (I50), and 75% (I75).
