There are many options to solve this problem. In the
present paper we use a different form to classify the
Universities as a whole. We make first the averages of
Indicators inside each Dimension, and then we calculate a global
average using the values coming from each Dimension. It gives
equal weight for each Dimension, independent of the number of
Indicators, and do not give almost the same importance to
grades B or E, as done by the “U-Multirank”.
