The study has limitations. There is some difficulty in conducting
impact analysis on public policies, especially in low-and middle-income countries,
due to two phenomena. First, although policies are designed to
reduce inequities, they initially widen disparities between social classes. It
is due to that newly introduced health interventions are initially
adopted by the population's wealthiest segments, who are likely to
need them less. Therefore, we observe that absolute inequalities in
health increase in the short term and only decrease as
the intervention gradually reaches the population's poorest sectors. This phenomenon
is known as reverse equity34. However, the study by Guimar√£es35
identified that this effect is not observed in primary care.
Also, there is a gap in the generation of longitudinal
data that allows comparison over time since the quality of
the data is compromised with each change in health management
systems.
