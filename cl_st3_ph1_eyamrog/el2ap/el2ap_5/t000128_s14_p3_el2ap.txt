100 g of leaves from L. ferrea were used for
decoction and they were deposited at a container with 200
mL of distilled water. Then, they were successively boiled at
water bath for 15 minutes to produce 200 mL of
decoction. The produced solution was considered at the concentration of
1:2 (LEONEZ et al., 2018). In the hydroalcoholic extract production,
the leaves were shredded, weighted and wrapped into a properly
identified amber glass container that was immersed during seven days
in a hydroalcoholic solvent solution (ethanol 70%), which was agitated
every 24 hours. After the immersion time, the compound was
taken to vacuum filtration, and afterwards to the evaporated in
water bath at a temperature of 50 ± ºC.
