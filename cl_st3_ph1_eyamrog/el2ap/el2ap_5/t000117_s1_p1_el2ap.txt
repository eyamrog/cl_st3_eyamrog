Our aim in this text is to analyze the effects
of the reports on the dematerialization of school by Edgard
Faure (1973) and by Jacques Delors (1998). This phenomenon has
been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The agenda of both
reports is centered around the encounter of education and Information
and Communication Technologies, in close connection with audiovisual and internet
resources. Our work hypothesis is that both the discourses around
the learning society, one celebrating the use of new teaching
techniques, and the other centered on the “demmuring”4 of childhood,
converge as they operate the dematerialization of school, while the
pandemic has created a context in which deterritorialization has become
temporarily unavoidable. We highlight in our conclusion that, in the
current urban context, informed by an idea of education in
the sense that all artifacts are educational, learning has become
the platform of the already “demmured” and dematerialized spaces-ambiances.
