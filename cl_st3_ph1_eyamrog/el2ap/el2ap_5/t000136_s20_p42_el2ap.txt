This reflection has a strong association with the assumption of
different planning horizon of the agency theory, which implies the
transience of the principal in relation to the NPO, whose
efforts are limited to the time of the contractual relationship,
that is, to the project. Thus, using Jensenâ€™s classification (1993)
for the third sector environment, the donation market acts as
a complement of the legal and regulatory political system, as
an external mechanism of governance for NPO in the delimitation
of legal security, given the general legal context and low
regulation in Brazil.
