While university textbooks represent a well-ordered publishing industry that structures
the instructional design of many post-secondary courses, many instructors, particularly
in the social sciences and the humanities have for decades
opted instead to assign their students a ragtag collection of
articles, chapters, and excerpts, drawn from original scholarly and trade
sources. These collections form, as Ehren Helmut Pflugfelder colorfully puts
it, “an object from the underworld, from the abyss beneath
the post-historical university” (2012, p. 249). As such, they have
been attracting copyright infringement suits since the proliferation of copy-shops
in the 1980s that made this teaching strategy a practical
reality, most notably with the early Basic Books v. Kinko's
Graphics (1991) in the United States.
