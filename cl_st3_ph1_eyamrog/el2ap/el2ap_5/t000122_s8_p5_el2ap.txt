Sediment and several mangrove organisms (e.g. microalgae, protozoa, fungi, nematodes,
microcrustaceans, annelids, small molluscs, chironomid larvae, trombiculid mites) are associated
to the Bostrychietum (García et al. 2016, Vieira et al.
2018). Epiphyte macroalgae and endophyte fungi may also be associated
to Bostrychia spp. (De Felício et al. 2015). So, laboratory
cultures of Bostrychia sp. free of contaminating organisms (unialgal cultures)
are difficult, and protocols for surface decontamination adjusted for species
of Bostrychia are needed.
