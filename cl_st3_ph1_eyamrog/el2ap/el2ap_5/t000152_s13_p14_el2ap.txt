Law 11,206/2005, law project im 2004, that established ProUnias well
as the call for the opening of a semiannual selection
process does not explicitly mention distance education. Although some sites
indicate that ProUni student funding grants are available for distance
education, in practice candidates do not find the option when
they register. Segenreich (2009) confirms that in 2006 the possibility
of offering ProUni for distance education was considered, however, in
2009, in the state of Par√°, there were only 6
institutions from other states that offered ProUni in distance education.
The information available from other sources is confusing and unclear.2
The website of the Brazilian Ministry of Education still does
not offer data distributed by teaching modalities. Of those who
pay for their own studies, 22% stated that they were
considering dropping out because of the cost burden, while 60%
cited changing labour market conditions as a result of the
pandemic as a factor influencing their decision whether to continue
with their studies (Brazilian Association of Higher Education Administrators 2020b).
