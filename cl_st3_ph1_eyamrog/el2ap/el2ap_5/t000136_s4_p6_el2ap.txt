Furthermore, we assumed that more governance is better, such as
Harris et al. (2015), Hansan et al. (2016) among others.
While supporting the idea that governance is important, as part
of NPO’ responsibility, we recommend that decisions on governance in
NPO undergo an opportunity cost analysis; without a benefit, activities
related to governance (for example, audit procedures) would be diverting
resources from NPO’ institutional mission.
