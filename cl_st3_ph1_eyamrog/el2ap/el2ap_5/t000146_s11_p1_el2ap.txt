As observed in previous studies[10], the main papers published in
one of the most prestigious international scientific databases (Web of
Science) are in English. These scientific articles represent 95.87% of
the total, followed by Spanish with 3%. If we compare
this with the countries that are members of the European
Union, the documents written in English are 93%, followed by
German (2.64%), French (1.71%) and Spanish (1.36%). In the case
of Latin American (LAC) countries, 86% of the records are
published in English, Portuguese (7.35%) and Spanish (6.77%). In light
of this, it can be stated that English is the
language of collaboration between European Union - Latin American countries
(EU-LAC), while at the same time a relatively significant proportion
are in Spanish. This is undoubtedly on account of the
important role played by Spain in scientific collaboration with Latin
America and also because in recent years, there has been
an increase in the number of scientific journals in Spanish
that are indexed in the Web of Science (WoS), especially
those published by Latin American countries. This increase was a
direct result of the expansion of WoS coverage between 2005
and 2010 (TESTA, 2011), which in the case of Brazil
led to an increase in the number of journals from
27 to 132, while Argentina, Chile and Mexico had 15,
35 and 26 indexed journals respectively. According to Collazo-Reyes [12]
this greater presence of Brazilian journals meant that, when the
whole LAC output of journals in the region was taken
into account, for the first time, Portuguese became the second
most widely- used language.
