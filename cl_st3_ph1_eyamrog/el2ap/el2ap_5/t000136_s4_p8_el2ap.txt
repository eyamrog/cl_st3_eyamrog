In addition, due to the temporal characteristic of projects and,
therefore, the ephemeral aspect of this contractual relationship, in contrast
to their planning horizon, NPO should reduce their dependence on
donors, by diversifying their fund sources and increasing the volume
of donations without restrictions, not linked to projects, in order
to keep their actions towards perennial causes. Thus, they should
incorporate management practices because of their relevance, and not due
to donorsâ€™ pressure.
