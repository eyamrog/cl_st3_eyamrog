In addition to the increased chlorophyll content under shaded conditions,
morphological alterations such as higher LA and SLA help plants
in light interception process under shaded environments, as observed in
Mikania plants under I75 (Artru 2018). In plants developed under
I0, the SLA reduction enhance the protection and buffer the
damages of excessive solar radiance may cause (Givnish et al.
2004, Matos et al. 2009, Wentworth et al. 2006). The
small and dense leaves of plants developed under full sunlight
is a morphological mechanism in order to avoid excessive water
losses and protection of photosynthetic apparatus against possible photo-oxidative damages
caused by excessive solar radiances (Lima Junior et al. 2005).
