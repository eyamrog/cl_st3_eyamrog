The temporality of the project leads to the understanding that
governance in NPO is largely due to the influence of
the project. Each project, with its specificities, converges to practices
of governance at the organization level (Lacruz et al., 2019).
Temporality leads to the reflection that NPO, because of the
process of marketization (Salamon, 1997), can incorporate in their governance
necessary elements and those imposed by donors over the duration
of the project. However, at the end of a project,
these mechanisms are interrupted, and a future project incorporates or
modifies them, according to the new donorsâ€™ demands (Lacruz et
al., 2019). Although the results of the study do not
allow it, we consider, from the whole discussion, that it
is possible to make such a proposition.
