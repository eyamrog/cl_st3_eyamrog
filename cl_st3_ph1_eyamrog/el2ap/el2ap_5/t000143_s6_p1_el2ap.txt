This study has some limitations inherent to the methodology used.
The possibility of ecological fallacy cannot be excluded, since an
association observed between aggregates does not necessarily mean that the
same association occurs in an individual level 23. The low
construct validity is another possibility that cannot be ruled out,
since not all explanatory outcomes of the variables may have
been included in the methodology used 24. In order to
reduce some of these limitations, this study worked with variables
available in several national databases and may present differences in
quality inherent to the use of indirect estimates 25.
