In the domain of worry, metacognitive processes play an important
role, since they contribute, correct, assess, and regulate thoughts, besides
being closely connected to the development and maintenance of psychological
disorders (Dinis & Gouveia, 2011). Generally, high levels of worry
can trigger different psychiatric symptoms, many of them related to
common mental disorders, for instance anxiety or depression. During the
COVID-19 outbreak, exposure to information by the media may trigger
both unrealistic optimism and negative thoughts, which can accentuate distorted
predictions about health or even exaggerated worrying (Faro et al.,
2020). In this sense, studies investigating relations between worries and
mental health have shown that outcomes related to anxiety and
depression are common in contexts where there is excessive worrying
(Huang & Zhao; 2020; Topper, Emmelkamp, Watkins, & Ehring, 2017).
