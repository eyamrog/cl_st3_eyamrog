In this paper I intend to discuss the issue of
the relationship between the vague notion of "family" and a
more thorough discussion of "kinship", always based on migratory contexts.
Taking as example three cases studied within my research group,
I want to highlight a critical reflection on the position
of the family in migration studies. I intend to demonstrate
how it is more common that the term "family" operate
as an extinguisher for the differences and as part of
machineries that would have difficulty being maintained in case the
issue of kinship was to be seriously taken.
