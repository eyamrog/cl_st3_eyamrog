The decrease in the general rate of ICSAP showed a
slight in its velocity, coinciding with the revision of PNAB
in 2017. The trend remains, but with less significance. This
evidence suggests that the stagnation or increase in hospitalizations for
these conditions may affect the changes caused directly or indirectly
by the expected changes in the PNAB, as described in
other studies29. Since the beginning of the municipal government in
force in Rio de Janeiro, the cost-benefit and real impact
of PHC coverage implemented in the ten years before its
assumption have been questioned by a little experienced technical team.
The consequence of this context is the revision of management
contracts, the evasion of professionals, difficulty maintaining assistance flows, and
population coverage reduction. The impact of this financial and political
crisis has been documented in the literature30,31. The PHC contributed
to the improvement in the ACSC indicator, with effects on
access and equity and results almost reaching the levels observed
in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries32. Although
there is still plenty of room for improvement, the evidence
is clear that PHC is a powerful approach to health
care organization in Brazil33.
