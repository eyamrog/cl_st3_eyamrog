The trend in hospitalizations for obstetric causes 2017 suggests that
hospitalizations for such causes increase with the expansion of care
coverage at this level of attention. This phenomenon is possibly
related to the increase in access to health services, leading
to more significant detection of problems that lead to hospitalization28.
Non-significant changes for conditions such as anemia and infections of
the nose, ear and throat reinforce evidence from previous studies17,20.
We believe that these causes may not be potentially sensitive
to care at this level of care.
