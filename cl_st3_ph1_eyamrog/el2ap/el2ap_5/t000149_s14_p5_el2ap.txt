The proportion of herbs, shrubs and trees was determined. The
richness and representativeness of the families in relation to the
total number of species recorded was calculated for each sampling
site. The identification of species with toxic potential was related
to their biogeographic origin. The Sörensen Similarity Index (IS) was
used to express the degree to which two of the
sites were similar due to the species present / absent
in them (Sörensen 1948). In addition, the field work was
complemented with observations and guided walks together with the producers,
which resulted in information about the spontaneous forage resources1. Bibliographic
information and preliminary data from microhistological analysis of feces were
used to complete this information.
