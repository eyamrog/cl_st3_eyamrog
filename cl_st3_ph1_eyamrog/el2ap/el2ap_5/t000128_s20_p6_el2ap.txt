Such variation may occur due to the different forms of
extraction, since the extract may have molecules that can penetrate
the outer membrane of the Gram-negative bacteria cell wall, but
not in Gram-positive ones (DUFFY; POWER, 2001). Or yet, it
can happen due to phytochemical compounds in the extract that
presented a higher bioactivity on Gram-negative bacteria, because of a
higher affinity from these by its membrane lipid structure that
surrounds them, as evidenced by Engel et al. (2017), where
the utilized strains of Salmonella were more sensible than the
strains of S. aureus both for the disinfectant containing carvacrol
and for the disinfectant containing timol.
