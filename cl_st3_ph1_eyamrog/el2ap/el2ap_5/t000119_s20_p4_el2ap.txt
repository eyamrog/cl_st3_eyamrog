In another study with four distinct osmotic agents (CaCl2, KCl,
MgCl2, and NaCl), Stefanello et al. (2019) concluded that chia
seeds (Salvia hispanica L.) were sensitive to exposure to different
salts with osmotic potential between -0.1 and -0.4 MPa, which
was observed by decreased germination and vigor. Similarly, Barbieri et
al. (2019) found that the progressive reduction in osmotic potential
induced by NaCl, KCl, CaCl2 and MgCl2 salts negatively affected
seed germination and initial growth of quinoa seedlings (Chenopodium quinoa
Willd.).
