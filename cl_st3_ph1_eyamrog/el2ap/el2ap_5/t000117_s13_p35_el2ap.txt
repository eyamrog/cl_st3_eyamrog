Once this is stated, Sobe seems to recognize that the
school institution as we have known and attended until a
few months ago, before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic,
seems to no longer exist. In the excerpts above, he
recognizes the emergence of another type of education for the
future. And although he states that UNESCO has created a
Future of Education International Commission, the much talked about “future
of education” has already taken place; it is now the
past. “With alarming speed, the futures we had envisaged have
changed. In other words, everything that we had anticipated would
take place in a week, a month or a year
has dramatically changed” (Vidal & Bontempi Jr, 2020, p. 5).
What does it all mean?
