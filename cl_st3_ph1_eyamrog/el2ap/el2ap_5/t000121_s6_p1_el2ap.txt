The present investigation aimed to examine associations between meta-worry and
significant anxious and/or depressive symptoms in the Brazilian people during
the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is noteworthy that
all models had an excellent outcome, with explained variance relatively
high, around 40%, in addition to high values of correctly
predicted cases. Consistency of the explanatory variables was also observed,
which did not have much variation depending on the outcome.
In this sense, it was found that there are basic
characteristics that predicted the greatest predisposition to presenting symptoms of
anxiety and depression related to age, steady income, perception of
health, and meta-worry. Exceptionally, living alone was a significant explanatory
variable only for depression.
