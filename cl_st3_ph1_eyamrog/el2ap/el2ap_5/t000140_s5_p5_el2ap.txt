Following this three-step approach to paying royalties, we recommend that
Access Copyright’s approved tariff of $14.31 per student be applied
on a prorated basis to cover only the media articles
and trade book chapters of professional writers (as per step
#3 above). The professional writings assigned to students amounts to
15.4 pages per syllabus on average (Table 7). At the
current Access Copyright rate of $0.021 per page, this works
out to $0.171 a syllabus for students’ use of professional
writings in media pieces and trade book chapters. With students
carrying an average load of 8.2 courses a year, this
$0.171 per syllabus amounts to an annual charge of $1.40
per student, based on our sample of 3,391 syllabuses (2015
to 2020).
