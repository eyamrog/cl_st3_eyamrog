These questions which are already well known in the area
of the social sciences and humanities lie at the heart
of the debate about how to handle the local features
of some scientific communities, while at the same time ensuring
they meet the research requirements of an international audience. The
social sciences and humanities tend not only to study, but
also to serve and cooperate with culture and society, which
means that it is better if their research results are
communicated in languages other than English [8]. Moreover, this challenge
is even greater at a time when science is opening
up, and when the social repercussions of its findings are
being felt, particularly at a local level[9].
