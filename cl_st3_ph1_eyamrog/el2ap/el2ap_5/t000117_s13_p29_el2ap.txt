In Schools of the forest: the open-air model of children’s
education in Europe and in Spain, Ananda Casanova (2019) reconstitutes
the historical process of this pedagogical proposal that, created in
the 1950’s in the north of Europe, has rapidly disseminated
in the last thirty years both within Spain and in
other regions of the world: the USA, Canada, Australia, New
Zealand and South Korea and, more specifically, India, Israel and
Latin American nations including Brazil. Such proposals are presented as
alternatives to traditional teaching and have originated in individual or
group initiatives, boasting recognition and governmental support in countries such
as Germany, the United Kingdom and Denmark. Although, as rendered
evident by the study carried out by the author, the
pedagogical proposals that privilege children’s interaction with nature are not
recent and, in their more remote formulations, were related to
the value given to open-air life in the culture of
Nordic countries, its current expansion is related to the emergencies
of the present. At the end of the article, the
author summarizes very well the motivations that explain this new
flourishing.
