By focusing on the effects of governance, many of which
address a factors or dimensions of governance, previous studies brought
important contributions about the influence of governance on donations. However,
donations still have not included the potential impact of governance
as a latent variable, that is a set of dimensions,
regarding donations received by NPO. Some dimensions of governance affect
donations and others do not, as shown by Harris et
al. (2015), who identified a positive association between six out
of seven governance dimensions, investigated in donations. Hence, these findings
contributed to clarify the effect of governance dimensions on donations,
but not the effect of governance as a latent variable.
In this sense, our central research question is whether governance,
taken as a second-order construct, affects donor-constrained donations.
