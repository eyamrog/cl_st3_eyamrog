The persistence of high rates of intestinal parasitism even after
prophylactic treatment indicates the need to carry out the appropriate

the treatment needs to be directed to the species of
parasite that the individual hosts. In addition, a non-specific treatment
can cause alterations in the behavior of the parasite and
cause adverse symptoms.26
