In Equation 7, p indicates the number of delays, and
Δ indicates the difference operator. The (W0) test statistics, which
are calculated for stationarity, and the (W1) test statistics, which
are calculated for nonstationarity, are calculated by using the Harvey
et al. (2008) Wλ test statistics. They conform with the
distribution of Wλ 𝑥2 2.
