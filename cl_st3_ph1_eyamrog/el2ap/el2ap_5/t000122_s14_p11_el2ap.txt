ANOVA and Tukey’s test were performed to compare the thalli
weights observed at the three cultivation weeks for the same
treatment. Final weights measured from immersion treatments in 5% liquid
detergent and 1% povidone iodine were compared to the control
by ANOVA, whereas a Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare
the final weights from immersion treatments in 5% liquid detergent
and 0.2% sodium hypochlorite to the control. RGRs of the
thalli immersed in 5% liquid detergent and 0.2% sodium hypochlorite
were compared to the control by ANOVA and Tukey’s test.
