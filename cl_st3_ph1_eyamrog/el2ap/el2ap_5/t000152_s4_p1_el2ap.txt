The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed weaknesses and difficulties that threaten
access and retention in Brazilian higher education. The instability of
the labour market, loss of jobs and latent uncertainties about
the future of the labour market weaken the resolve and
ability of students to remain in higher education. Public HEIs
especially lack adequate technological infrastructure to support the academic faculty
in delivering courses online. Teachers often feel unprepared to handle
technological resources, digital platforms and virtual classrooms.
