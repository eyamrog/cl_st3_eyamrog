All the other countries have a more representative impact on
SciELO CI, when they publish in Spanish, even the USA.
Unlike what was observed with regard to the language of
the articles cited, the SciELO CI regional database is a
valuable resource and acts as a showcase for impact, when
it comes to publications in Spanish or Portuguese. On the
other hand, the effect of publications in English is more
significant in the WoS database, particularly in the case of
Brazil, followed by Colombia and Spain. It should be noted
that the volume of citations to the USA, when published
in English, is less than 9%, since their impact is
mainly outside SciELO CI.
