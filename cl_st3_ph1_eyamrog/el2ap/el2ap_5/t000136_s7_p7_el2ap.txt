Ambience can change the behavior of NPO regarding their governance,
due to State's regulatory role, which creates an external control
environment through the elaboration and enforcement of laws (Desai and
Yetman, 2015). In addition to the existence of acts, the
intensity of their enforcement is another measure. Therefore, the law
enforcement environment (strict or not) can also affect NPO governance
(Yetman and Yetman, 2012). Thus, our contribution lies in the
development of a governance operationalized as a second- order construct,
given the multiple conceptual layers of governance dimensions, so that
it is possible to evaluate the effect of governance on
donations in an environment of low regulation and limited access
to information.
