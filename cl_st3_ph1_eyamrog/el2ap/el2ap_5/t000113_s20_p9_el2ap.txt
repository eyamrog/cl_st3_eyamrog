Gender is a social construction that influences the world's perception
(Abad et al., 2020). Social practices and relationships build the
identity of men and women. They are products of power
relations that consider the female identity fragile, insecure, emotional, selfless.
Gender stereotypes create barriers to the growth of female social
figures, thus, creating legitimizing myths. Such as the constant recognition
of the gifted male figure to the detriment of the
female figure. It is notorious in the cultures of American
countries.
