Leaf area and biomass analysis - To measure leaf area
(LA), we detached leaves from the whole plant and detached
leaf discs of 1 cm2 from basal, median, and apical
regions of the leaves. Using the disc area, disc dry
weight, and total leaf dry weight, we estimated the mean
leaf area. Specific leaf area (SLA) was estimated as the
ratio of leaf area to leaf dry mass (dm2 g-1).
