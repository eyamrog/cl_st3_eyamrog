Two of the species of the herpetofauna recorded in the
PNT – Hemidactylus mabouia and Trachemys scripta – are exotic
invaders. The house gecko, H. mabouia, was originally introduced into
Brazil from Africa during the colonial period, and has since
expanded its area of distribution considerably in the country’s natural
environments (Rocha & Bergallo 2011, Telles et al. 2015, Oliveira
et al. 2016, Winck et al. 2017). Hemidactylus mabouia was
observed in the built-up areas of the PNT, which is
typical of its occurrence at other localities (Rocha et al.
2011, Oliveira et al. 2016). The presence of this lizard
in the vicinity of the park’s natural habitats demands special
attention due to the potential for the species to become
invasive (Rocha et al. 2011).
