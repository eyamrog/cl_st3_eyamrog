On the other hand, the result of our research indicates
that, for the sample composed of Brazilian organizations, public certifications
provided to NPO (as OS, OSCIP or CEBAS) does not
contribute to increase Donations with donor restrictions. Thus, Brazilian donors
did not respond favorably to NPO certification, regarding the volume
of donations. We suggest that donors did not perceive the
benefits (tangible or intangible) of these certifications, for several reasons:
(i) a possible lack of credit of the issuer (the
Brazilian State), since one expects that certifications will lead to
legitimacy and favorable reputation, as the issuer lends its credibility
to the recipient - in this case, it would be
a ‘discredited accreditation’; (ii) because NPO without certification have voluntarily
incorporated non-mandatory mechanisms, due to donor pressures (Lacruz et al.,
2019), so that donors cannot distinguish NPO with and without
the seal of distinction, only by observing their governance practices;
or (iii) because the presence of governance mechanisms is sufficient,
which makes the certification unnecessary, from donors’ point of view.
