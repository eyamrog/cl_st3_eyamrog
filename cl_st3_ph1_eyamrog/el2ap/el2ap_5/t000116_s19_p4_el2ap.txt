We observed the magnitude of changes in the trend (Table
2). The most notable changes occurred during the RCAPS period.
For the total rate, there was a non-significant increase in
baseline admissions. The reform impacted the change in trend, causing
it to reduce in the period significantly. The change in
the PNAB did not change the trend but reduced the
rate of decline. Also, the coefficient is no longer significant,
suggesting that the monitoring of the historical series for a
long time may show a reversal of the downward trend
in some months. Some groups follow the same pattern as
the total rate. We highlight vaccine- preventable diseases, nutritional deficiencies,
diabetes, and gastrointestinal ulcers. We also highlight diseases with a
consistent reduction in the three periods, with a more extended
adaptation to changes. It is the case of hypertension, which
initially reduced the speed of falls during RCAPS, but substantially
increased the speed after implementing the new PNAB. Still, we
highlight diseases related to childbirth and the puerperium, which initially
tended to increase. The speed of increase decreased during the
RCAPS, and the new PNAB changed the trend, becoming a
trend reduction.
