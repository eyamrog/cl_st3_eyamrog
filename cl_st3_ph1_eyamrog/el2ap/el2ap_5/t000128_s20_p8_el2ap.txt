The results, according to the variables smell, color, texture, surface
aspect (based on its cleanliness and brightness), utilized to evaluate
the acceptability of the disinfectant are described in Table 5.
In all the evaluated criteria there was a higher acceptability
of the disinfectant made from L. ferrea leaves, with a
higher frequency of acceptance (83.6%) in the aroma. There is
no report of natural products utilized as disinfectants, regarding acceptability.
However, Teixeira and Becker (2017) claim that the best product
for disinfection and sanitation in surfaces is the 70% alcohol,
since it is so effective as sodium hypochlorite, with a
contact of at least 10 minutes.
