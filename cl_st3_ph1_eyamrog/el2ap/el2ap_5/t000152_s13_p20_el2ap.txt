The geographic remoteness of many municipalities and the low availability
of broadband internet in both urban and rural households has
been a major factor limiting the adoption of distance modalities
during the pandemic. The 2018 Survey on the Use of
Information and Communication Technologies in Brazilian Households, carried out by
the statutory Brazilian Internet Steering Committee (2019), surveying just over
33,000 households, revealed that connection to the internet is not
yet universalized and is worst in rural areas where just
44% of the households surveyed have access to the internet.
