In a way synchronous with the deterritorialization and dematerialization of
school there has been a trend for its reterritorialization into
spaces-ambiances mediated by ICTs. The places\sites where people live have
become learning spaces-ambiances such as, for instance, homes. As households
are transformed into simultaneous ambiances, including and chiefly of learning,
the space-ambience, previously occupied by the school institution, has been
reterritorialized and displaced into the interior of peopleâ€™s homes and
indeed to all places, according to the perspectives announced in
the discourses about the educating city. Indeed, screens and their
digital connectivity have become the interface, via virtual classrooms, with
other ambiances and geographies, be them close by and\or distant.
But without fiber optic cables buried on the ground or
on the seabed, there is be no way to secure
such supposedly8 planetary digitalized connectivity to all, as well as
working the world as we experience today.
