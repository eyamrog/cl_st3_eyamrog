Thoropa lutzi is classified as Endangered by the IUCN (2020),
but as Data Deficient in Brazil (ICMBIO 2018). This species
is known to occur only in the states of Rio
de Janeiro and Espírito Santo. Populations have not been observed
in Rio de Janeiro over the past 30 years, however,
including PNT (Sabbag et al. 2018). The other three species,
Cycloramphus eleutherodactylus, Vitreorana eurygnatha, and V. uranoscopa, are listed only
at the state level (Bergallo et al. 2000), as Presumably
Threatened, and only C. eleutherodactylus is listed by the IUCN
(2020), as Data Deficient. Cycloramphus eleutherodactylus is known to occur
in the Brazilian states of Paraná, São Paulo, Rio de
Janeiro, and Minas Gerais (Rossa-Feres et al. 2017, Santos-Pereira et
al. 2018), although some studies have reported its disappearance by
the beginning of the 20th century (Izecksohn & Carvalho-e-Silva 2001,
Eterovick et al. 2005). We did not collect C. eleutherodactylus
during fieldwork and it has not been found at PNT
since 1972 (Matos 2011). Nevertheless, Lima et al. (2012) concluded
that this species may be relatively abundant in some cave
environments, and emphasized the importance of including these habitats in
amphibian inventories.
