High carotenoids levels under high light conditions are an essential
mechanism for photoprotection since it prevents photooxidative damage of chloroplast
pigments and avoids the formation of singlet oxygen (Demmig-Adams &
Adams 1992, Yamamoto & Bassi 1996, Gon√ßalves et al. 2001).
The total number of molecules of carotenoid per chlorophyll molecule
is typically higher in leaves grown in high irradiation environments
when compared with leaves of shaded plants, which is in
agreement with our results.
