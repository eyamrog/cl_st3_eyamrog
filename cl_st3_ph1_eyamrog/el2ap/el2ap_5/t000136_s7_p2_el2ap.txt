In general, the discussion starts from the hypothesis that, all
else equal, better-governed NPO receive more donations. Previous studies, depending
on the specific research question, analyzed the potential influence of
specific governance factors (for example, board size) or governance dimensions
(such as disclosure) measured by sets of manifest variables (for
example, annual report). For example, Harris et al. (2015) identified
seven governance dimensions using factor analysis (board, management, policies, access,
audit, executive compensation and minutes) and showed that donations and
government grants are positively associated with six of the dimensions
(minutes had no effect).
