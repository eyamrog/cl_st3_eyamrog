Physicochemical and Microbiological Analysis of Individual Soil Samples - when
comparing the percentages of gravimetric humidity, the control group showed
no significant difference (p = 0.11) between the samples, whereas
the treatment group exhibited a significant difference (p = 0.01)
between the sampling periods; this difference may be indirectly related
to the presence of litter. As the humidity of all
plots decreased, species richness decreased in four of the five
plots, so it can be assumed that the difference (p
= 0.06) found between species over the two periods is
significant (figure 1).
