Table 2 illustrates the results of the final spatial regression
analysis model. The percentage of women heads of families (matriarchy)
and the Municipal Human Development Index (MHDI) were positively associated
with the rates of femicide in Sergipe's municipalities in the
period between 2013 and 2017 (p <0.05). The opposite situation
occurred between the Income Concentration Index (GINI Index) and the
rates of femicide in these municipalities in the period studied.
