Bryophytes are nonvascular land plants that include mosses (Bryophyta, Goffinet
et al. 2009), liverworts (Machantiophyta, Crandall-Stotler et al. 2009) and
hornworts (Anthocerotophyta, Renzaglia et al. 2009). Usually, they are small
in size and colonize a wide variety of substrates and
ecosystems, except for marine habitats (Costa et al. 2010, Vanderpoorten
& Goffinet 2009). They are dependent on humidity mainly due
to the presence of flagellated gametes and the poikilohydric mechanism,
which is why they are more frequent in humid environments,
such as the Atlantic Forest. This domain holds almost 90%
of the Brazilian bryoflora (Costa et al. 2010, Costa &
Peralta 2015). Conservation Units (CU) have great relevance in protecting
the biodiversity of forest remnants. The Parque Nacional do Caparaó
(PNC) is an important conservation unit located in southeastern Brazil.
It includes the third highest peak of the country, the
“Pico da Bandeira”, rising to 2,892 m above sea level
(a.s.l.). Due to its vast extent, the PNC presents a
variety of environments and different vegetation compositions, thus possessing great
biodiversity that still needs to be discovered and better understood.
Furthermore, the park has some waterfalls suitable for swimming, attracting
many visitors throughout the year. The last state tourism report,
from 2014 to 2017, counted an average of 10,000 visitors
per year, with peaks of up to 2,500 visitors per
month during high season (Jun-Aug) (ICMBio 2021a; OTE-ES 2018). Therefore,
a great ally of conservation is to know the biological
diversity of these environments that receive tourists and visitors, as
they are as important as the preserved areas.
