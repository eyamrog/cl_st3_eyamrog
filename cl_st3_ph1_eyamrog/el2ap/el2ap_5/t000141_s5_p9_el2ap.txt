Although it meets some of the criteria required by WHO
49, most Brazilian states did not present concrete policies to
screen, monitor, and, mainly, optimized the testing of suspected cases.
Only Pará, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Santa Catarina presented
indicators related to the mentioned categories, but still, in a
fragile way, as only Pará described the metric used to
calculate the indicator. This is a critical finding as, without
prioritization by the public tracking system, the reopening plans operate
in a scenario that may not match the state's epidemiological
reality.
