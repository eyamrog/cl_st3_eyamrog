The relative abundance of both amphibian and reptilian species in
the PNT was adjusted to a log-series model, a pattern
typical of communities of medium diversity, showing certain degree of
equilibrium between the rare and dominant species (Magurran & McGill
2011). In this model, most species are relatively rare in
comparison with the more abundant taxa (Magurran 2004). The four
most abundant amphibian species (I. parva, H. nasus, I. guentheri,
and C. gaudichaudii) contributed to around 70% of the total
records of amphibians obtained in the park. The genus Ischnocnema
belongs to the superfamily Brachycephaloidea (sensu Padial et al. 2014),
which spawn on the moist forest floor and have direct
development, so they do not depend on bodies of water
for their breeding and development (Haddad & Prado 2005, Pombal
& Haddad 2007). Species that have direct development tend to
be dominant in leaf litter-dwelling anuran communities in Neotropical rainforests
(e.g., Crump 1971, Allmon 1991, Donnelly 1994, Rocha et al.
2001, Siqueira et al. 2014). Two stream-dwelling frog species, Hylodes
nasus and C. gaudichaudii, were the most abundant species recorded
at the PNT. Hylodidae species are generally abundant in small
streams in preserved Atlantic Rainforest areas (e.g., Weygoldt 1989, Patto
& Pie 2001, Almeida-Gomes et al. 2008, Siqueira et al.
2011b).
