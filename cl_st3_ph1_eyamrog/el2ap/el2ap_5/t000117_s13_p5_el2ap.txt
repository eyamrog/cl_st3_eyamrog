For the former UNESCO representative in Brazil and former coordinator
of the UNESCO – Mercosul program, Jorge Werthein (2000), information
societies replace industrial societies, having elevated information to the status
of the main economic asset resulting from the restructuring of
the markets in the 1980’s. Werhein states that the main
changes in the educational field yield from the employment of
self-learning technologies.
