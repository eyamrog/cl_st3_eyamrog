Data were collected during the first two months of 2017,
and they refer to the fiscal year of 2015, in
order to avoid bias due to unavailable information. Since the
responsible body only discloses all documents of a specific year
in the subsequent year, we did not want to risk
having incomplete data, if we worked with information regarding 2016
or 2017.
