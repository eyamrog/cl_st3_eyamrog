If it seems that such amounts are de minimis in
a legal sense, and thus not worth pursuing, we side
with the “many poets” in Eli MacLaren’s study of Canadian
poet’s income (which found royalty payments amounted to two percent
of their income) who nonetheless “described the validation that even
a little money brings with it” (2017, p. 20). Our
three-step syllabus rule provides for validation of poets, as well
as the recognition of academics. While there is room for
this annual fee of $1.40 per student to grow over
time, it stands in contrast to the $26.00 per student
that Access Copyright is currently requesting, as we write, from
the Canadian Copyright Board (Copyright Board, 2017).
