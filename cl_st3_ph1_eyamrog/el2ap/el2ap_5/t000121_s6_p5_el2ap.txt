Finally, it was detected that the main explanatory variable of
this study was meta- worry, which considerably increased the chances
of symptoms in the 2 possible outcomes, reaching almost 13
times more chances for the presence of symptoms of anxiety
and depression, simultaneously. In terms of diagnosis, meta-worry is a
key element for anxious symptoms and in the context of
the current pandemic the scenario itself is conducive to the
development of different worries, there is the fear of contagion,
of death itself or of loved ones, in addition to
imposed social isolation (Liu et al., 2020). In this regard,
outcomes related to the symptoms of anxiety and depression are
common in contexts associated with excessive meta-worrying (Topper et al.,
2017) and studies already show vulnerability to these conditions in
people who spend a considerable amount of time with cognitions
related to the pandemic (Huang & Zhao, 2020). During epidemics,
the number of people whose mental health is affected tends
to be greater than the number of people affected by
the disease and tends to outlast the epidemic itself (Shigemura,
Ursano, Morganstein, Kurosawa, & Benedek, 2020), which brings to the
agenda, in the Brazilian context, the topic of excessive worrying.
