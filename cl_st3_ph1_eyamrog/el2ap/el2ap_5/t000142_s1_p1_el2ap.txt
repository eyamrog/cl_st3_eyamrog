Abstract This study aimed to review femicide, which is a
result of violence against women and a serious public health
problem, from a different perspective. Accordingly, it analyzed the presence
of a relationship between foreign exchange, which was an essential
trigger of the crises and unemployment, and femicide, which was
the result of violence against women different from the act
of murder. In the light of this aim, the data
were obtained from the We Will Stop Femicide Platform, and
the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey. These data
were examined through various analyses. According to the analysis results,
a long-term cointegrating relationship was found between the foreign exchange
rate and femicide in Turkey. The findings have demonstrated that
the deviation caused by a 1% shock in the exchange
rate could be balanced after 22.6 days. This study, which
is significant in terms of questioning femicide from a neglected
economic perspective, contributes to the literature by revealing that current
and advanced empirical analyses and exchange rate fluctuations are "vital"
in terms of non-economic facts and public health as well.
