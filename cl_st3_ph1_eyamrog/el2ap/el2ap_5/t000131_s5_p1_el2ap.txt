In this study, we unraveled the main morpho-physiological characteristics of
two tropical lianas species in response to light availability. Our
main hypothesis was not corroborated, since Mikania glomerata showed a
better growth performance under I0, I25, and I50, while Mikania
laevigata showed improved performance under I25. Plants grown under I0
and I25 showed greater gs and E. The increased air
temperature and VPD observed at 150 DAT presumably caused the
reduction in gs, E, and A in both Mikania species.
Stomatal closure under high light conditions combined with high temperature,
and low relative humidity it is a mechanism that decreases
the water loss rate to the environment, but it also
decreases the CO2 influx into the leaves (Hsie et al.
2015). Stomatal regulation is an advantageous strategy, especially during the
dry season. Under field conditions, improved iWUE due to the
reduction of gs and constant A values is the most
effective mechanism for the continued growth of plants without experiencing
dramatic water loss (Hanba et al. 2002).
