According to Costa et al. (2017b), the type material of
Eunotia camelus Ehrenberg illustrated in Reichardt (1995) included a population
composed of two different species, a fact that brings some
confusion regarding the classification of the species. In the southeastern
Brazil, most of the populations identified as E. camelus actually
are Eunotia longicamelus L.F.Costa, D.C.Bicudo & C.E.Wetzel. It was reported
in 15% of the core samples, and reached 3% maximum
abundance. The species is found in samples from the early
Late Holocene (~1.514 cal. yr BP) to the core top.
