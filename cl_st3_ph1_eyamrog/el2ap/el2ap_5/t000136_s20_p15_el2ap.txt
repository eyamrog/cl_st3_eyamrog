Transparency, in this study, is similar to OECD disclosure principle
(2004), and means the public dissemination of relevant information. In
our study, it consisted of disclosing information through the Internet
(websites, fanpages etc.) regarding financial statements (audited or non-audited), the
Annual Report, and the professional qualification of NPOâ€™s team (executive
and board members).
