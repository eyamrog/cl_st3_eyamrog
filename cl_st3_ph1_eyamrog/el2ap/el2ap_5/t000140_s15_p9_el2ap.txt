Before proceeding, the students had to score 80 percent or
better on a test set of syllabuses, based on the
lead researcher’s scoring of reading types. Once underway, students were
asked to cross-check a small sample (5-20) of each others’
scored syllabuses, with discrepancies resolved by a third student (who
had demonstrated relatively consistent scores in cross-checking), with the lead
researcher stepping in as needed. When other scoring discrepancies were
discovered, a few of the more proficient students were entrusted
with re-analysis. In addition, the students recorded page counts on
a sample of readings that provided page-number information (Table 2).
The page counts were totaled and divided by the number
of readings sampled to come up with an average pages-per-reading
for each reading type.
