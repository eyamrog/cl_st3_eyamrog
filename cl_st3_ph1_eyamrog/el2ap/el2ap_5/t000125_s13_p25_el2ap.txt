To generate this classification, “U-Multirank” makes a criterion similar to
an “Olympic Medals Table”. The best performers are the Universities
that obtained the highest number of grades A. Scores B
and below are considered only for tiebreakers. Then, the first
one is Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, because it
has 3 A, 3 B, 2 C and 3 D,
against 3 A, 2 B and 6 D from Federal
University of São Carlos, which takes the second place in
this form of making a general classification. Other positions use
the same rule.
