Microorganisms with the 1.5 × 108 UFC/mL concentration were equivalent
to the pattern 5 of the McFarland’s scale. These were
cultivated in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth at 37ºC. Five
microdilution plates with 96 wells each were utilized (ALAMAR®, Diadema,
São Paulo, Brazil). Each microorganism had its growth analyzed in
triplicate at the concentrations of 100 mg/mL from the extract
and from the decoction, as well with the positive control
with the alcoholic solution of chlorhexidine (CP) at 0.5% and
the negative control of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).
