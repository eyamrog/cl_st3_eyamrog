This article analyzes governance composed as a set of dimensions
measured by governance factors that influences donations with donor restrictions
received by environmental Nonprofit Organizations (NPO) in Brazil, under the
agency theory perspective. Data were collected through a survey, and
the random sample of 108 observations. We identified governance dimensions
through Multiple Correspondence Analysis. From these dimensions, it was verified,
through Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling, if governance affected
donations. It was observed that that governance positively affected donations
and that public certifications provided to NPO in Brazil did
not moderate the relationship between governance and donations. These results
showing that governance helps NPO to have easier access to
the donations market and that public certifications provided to NPO
do not contribute to increasing donations. These findings are important
for practitioners and also to enrich the debate about public
policies for the third sector in low regulated environments.
