Present species resembles Luticola acidoclinata Lange-Bertalot (1996) in its valve
outline and dimensions (L: 10-30 μm, W: 5.0-8.5 μm). However,
Luticola intermedia (Hustedt) Levkov, Meltzeltin & A.Palov exhibits a narrow
and linear axial area, with 4-5 isolate areolae at the
valve margin (Levkov et al. 2013). It was present in
only 3% of the core samples, and reached 1% maximum
abundance. The species is present in samples corresponding to the
Late Holocene (~689 cal. yr BP). Current inventory is the
first report of this species presence in the Brazilian Amazon.
