The indicators presented in the study's documentary data base were
stratified into simple and composite, the latter being defined as
the aggregation of two or more simple indicators.(42) Among the
normative bases studied, eight adopted composite indicators: Espírito Santo, Pará,
Piauí, Rio Grande do Sul and São Paulo, which used
two indicators; Alagoas and Acre, with three; and Santa Catarina,
with four. The most recurrent compound criteria were related to
the disease's spread and the ability to meet the state
health system.
