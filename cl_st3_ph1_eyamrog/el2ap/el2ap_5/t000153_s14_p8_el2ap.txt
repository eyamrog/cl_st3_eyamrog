The pioneering work by sociologist Ervin Goffman collected information on
how the translation takes place, in symbolic terms, of certain
personal attributes and their categorization for the establishment of a
“social identity”. His work shows how an attribute that is
questioned at a specific point becomes a stigma, understood as
a mark, a fault, which is present in people who
are “uncommon” or in those who possess an “unwanted difference”
(Goffman 2008). Following the author, the origin of such discredit
is explained as a result of a discrepancy between the
virtual social identity and the real social identity that a
person should maintain, according to the social expectations formed in
each context. This is due to the fact that “not
all undesirable attributes are at issue, but only those which
are incongruous with our stereotype of what a given type
of individual should be” (Goffman 2006, p.132). Although the author
equates stigma with an attribute which is deeply discrediting for
the people who suffer from it, at the same time
he declares that “an attribute that stigmatizes one type of
possessor can confirm the usualness of another”, therefore such attribute
is not “creditable nor discreditable as a thing in itself
(Goffman 2006, p.132). This means that discredit acts in relation
to the context, pointing as problematic one aspect of the
individual, in the eyes of the established norm in that
place, among those individuals and for that society. At the
same time, he points out that the term is employed
from a double perspective: when the stigmatized individual assumes that
their difference is already known or evident at a given
moment, their situation is that of those who are discredited;
in contrast, when the individual supposes that their difference is
not known to those who are present nor is it
immediately perceptible by them, it is about the situation of
those who are discreditable (Goffman 2006). In the latter case,
the stigmatized attribute can be hidden from others.
