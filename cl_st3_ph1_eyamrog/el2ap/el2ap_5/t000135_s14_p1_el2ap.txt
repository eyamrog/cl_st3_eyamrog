This is an ecological, retrospective, observational study using secondary data
from several public databases, comprising all 5,564 Brazilian municipalities and
with data from information systems in the National Public System
(Sistema Único de Saúde - SUS). This equates to 99.9%
of Brazil’s 5,570 municipalities. All of the data that comprised
the study variables were extracted from secondary databases in the
public domain, not therefore requiring approval from the Research Ethics
Committee. Data collection was carried out by a single researcher
in February 2021.
