1. Check library holdings and open access. A universityâ€™s syllabuses
would be analyzed by an artificial intelligence system to determine
which assigned readings are accessible to students through institutional licenses
and open access. The materials the university does not yet
license would be treated as acquisition recommendations. The continuing consideration
given to acquiring assigned academic resources valued by instructors leads
to the second step. The non-academic readings for which the
university does not hold an institutional license would go to
the third step for processing.
