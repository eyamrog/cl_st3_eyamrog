As mentioned in previous paragraphs, the percentage of exotic species
increases in places where some type of cultivation has been
carried out, where the transit of machinery is frequent or
in pastures with excessive stocking rates. This brings with it
the problem that 66% of these species (51 sp.) are
toxic or potentially toxic to cattle. Several authors (Krikor &
Hierro 2011; Peralta & Klich, in press) are in agreement
with this and they expressed a warning about the introduction
of adventitious species in the disturbed areas, many of which
present these unfavourable and harmful characteristics for cattle production, (Fig.
3c). Examples of these adventitious species are Conium maculatum L.
(Apiaceae), Diplotaxis tenuifolia (L.) DC., Hirschfeldia incana (L.) Lagr.-Foss. and
Sisymbrium irio L. (Brassicaceae), Vicia villosa Roth. and Trifolium repens
L. (Fabaceae) and Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. (Poaceae).
