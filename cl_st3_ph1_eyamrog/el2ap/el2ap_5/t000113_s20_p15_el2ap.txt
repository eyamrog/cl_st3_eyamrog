Pratto (1994) considers the psychological aspect of TDS by postulating
that an individual variable called Social Domain Orientation (SDG) represents
the extent to which a person wants a group to
dominate and be superior to other groups. ODS is an
attitudinal orientation towards intergroup relationships, reflecting an individual preference for
hierarchical relationships ordered along a superior- inferior dimension (Pratto et
al., 1994). Although these beliefs benefit some group members, their
internalization by oppressed groups also prevents them from engaging in
social actions against inequalities and prejudices (Islam, 2014).
