Eunotia sp. resembles Eunotia myrmica Lange-Bertalot (2011), but the latter
has narrower and cuneate apices, as well as smaller valve
dimensions (Pavlov & Levkov 2013: L: 58.8-67 Âµm). The taxon
was rarely observed, occurring in 2 % of the core
samples and reaching 1% maximum abundance. It is present in
samples from the Late Holocene (~811 cal. yr BP).
