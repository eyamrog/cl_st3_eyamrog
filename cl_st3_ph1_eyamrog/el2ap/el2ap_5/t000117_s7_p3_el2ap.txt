The argument we will develop here is that the discourses
regarding the education of the future point at the dematerialization
of school as we have known since the passage of
the nineteenth to the twentieth century, when public education systems
spread internationally, up to the end of the 2020’s, when
social isolation was imposed in order to tackle the COVID-19
pandemic. The discourse that takes notice of the increasingly close
association between education and ICTs, foreseeing the dissociation between learning
and schooling institutions of the future, had been announced in
the international reports written by Edgar Faure and by Jacques
Delors, whose effects would be manifested in the promulgation of
a federal law in Brazil, the National Education Guidelines and
Basic Law (LDBEN number 9.394/1996), in the same year of
the publication of Delors’ report. We add that this dissociation
between learning and school has also been suggested in other
types of discourse, where, instead of the exaltation of the
possibilities of new technologies in education, the demmuring of childhood
and a renovation of the schooling experience by means of
close contact with nature is proposed (Barros, 2018). Such discourse
will be characterized below, grounded on the publication Demmuring childhood:
school as a meeting place with nature.
