The genus Urochloa consists of exotic invasive species that proliferate
and interact negatively with native species through interspecific resource competition,
cover growth and chemical inhibition through the release of secondary
compounds (Horowitz et al. 2007, Scabora 2011). In this competition,
the exotic species is favored and may inflict a depressant
effect on the native plants, eliminating them from the site,
which explains their absence on the plots.
