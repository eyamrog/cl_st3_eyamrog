According to the results of both tests, there is nonlinearity
in the femicide series. In the foreign exchange rate series,
there is nonlinearity, according to the Harvey & Leybourne (2007)
Test, and linearity, according to Harvey, Leybourne & Xiao (2008)
Test. Following the determination of the nonlinearity of the series
in the linearity tests, the stationarity of the series was
tested using nonlinear unit root tests. The results of the
analysis are presented in Table 3.
