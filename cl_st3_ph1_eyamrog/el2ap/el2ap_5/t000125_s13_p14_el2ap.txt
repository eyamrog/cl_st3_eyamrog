International Orientation (orange) is the fourth Dimension we will look
in some detail. It has six Indicators. Only International joint
publications comes from open sources. The other five are obtained
from the Institution. They are: Foreign language bachelor programmes, Foreign
language master programmes, Student mobility, International academic staff and International
doctorate degrees. Twelve Institutions have only one Indicator with data
available, which is the one based on open sources (International
joint publications). It means that there is room for improvements
in this Dimension just by reporting data. Four Universities have
grades in all the six Indicators, meaning that they are
making efforts to report data to get better positions in
this ranking. They are: Unesp, University of São Paulo, State
University of Campinas and State University of Maringá. There is
only one A, given to Federal University of Ceará. The
next best grades are B, received by University of São
Paulo and University of Campinas, one for each of them.
