The collection of stool samples was carried out by parents,
guardians or by the children and adolescents themselves when they
were old enough to understand and proceed with the collection
alone, after meeting the research team with members of the
indigenous community and their leaders. At this meeting, the objectives
and benefits of the research were explained, as well as
the correct way to collect the sample. Collection flasks duly
identified with the participants’ names were delivered along with verbal
and written collection instructions, with the help of the community
IHAs. Subsequently, the IHAs returned to the participants’ homes on
the following days to collect the flasks containing the stool
samples, which were packaged in cold coolers without the use
of chemical preservatives, sent to the Clinical Parasitology laboratory at
the State University of Western Paraná, in Cascavel, and maintained
at temperature 5 ºC, until processing, within 3 days. the
transport and conservation of the samples were carried out carefully
so as not to alter the morphology of the parasites
and the possibility of them meeting.
