Another common problem was reduced transparency concerning the document development
teams. Only ten plans contained a description of the authors'
professional activities with a remarkable predominance of technicians. The participation
of researchers and teachers in the preparation of the documents
was minimal or not reported, except for the states of
Espírito Santo(16) and Piauí(19). A mentions of community involvement was
found only in Pará. Therefore, the precariousness of the articulations
policies carried out for the structuring of plans can generate
significant difficulty in raising awareness and engaging the population, which
indicates the existence of distancing from the scientific community in
the process of developing public policies.
