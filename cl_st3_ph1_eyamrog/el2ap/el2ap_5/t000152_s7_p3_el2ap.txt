The SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused the worst global health crisis
in decades, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare
a pandemic in March 2020 (Pan American Health Organization 2020;
Vibha et al. 2020). A few days after this announcement,
Brazil, the largest country in Latin America, registered its first
case of infection and its first death from COVID-19 (Federative
Republic of Brazil 2020a). By 30 September 2020, Brazil was
the third worst affected country worldwide with 4,780,317 individual cases
of infection and 143,010 deaths (worldometers.info, 2020). The global toll
of infection on the same date was 33,249,563 cases with
1,000,004 deaths (World Health Organization 2020). While many of the
countries where the disease was first detected had apparently succeeded
in controlling its spread, reopening their economies and maintaining social
distancing and other precautionary measures, Brazil still seemed far from
reaching its epidemiological peak.1
