The historical context shows that public policies alone do not
guarantee equitable access to higher education, nor to better jobs
or a higher quality of life. Even under pre-COVID-19 conditions
the supply of higher education in Brazil was insufficient to
meet demand, and access was very difficult for people living
in slums or remote regions. The situation was aggravated by
the COVID-19 pandemic, which has laid bare the structural barriers
to universalization of higher education in Brazil. These include unequal
access to information and communication technologies (ICT), internet access, unemployment,
income reduction, and competing responsibilities. The COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated
many of Brazilâ€™s problems in terms of social inequality, unequal
income distribution, the poor quality of public schools.
