Nitzschia pusilluhasta E.A.Lehmkhul & C.E.M.Bicudo differs from Nitzschia amphibia Grunow
(1862: 574) because the latter species has lanceolate valves with
slightly protracted ends, and a gap between the central fibulae
(Lehmkuhl et al. 2019: 25-26). It can be also misidentified
as Nitzschia semirobusta Lange-Bertalot (1993: 149), however, N. pusilluhasta has
greater valve dimensions and rectangular, short to slightly extend fibulae.
It was present in 0.6% of the core samples and
reaches 3% maximum abundance. In the current study, N. pusilluhasta
was identified from samples corresponding to the Late Holocene (~2.400
cal. yr BP). This is the first report of the
species occurrence in the Amazon basin.
