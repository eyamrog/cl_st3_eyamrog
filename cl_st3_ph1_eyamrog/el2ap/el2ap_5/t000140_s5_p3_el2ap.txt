2. Limit fair dealing: The second step applies to the
scholarly readings that are not (yet) available to students through
Step 1. For these materials, an innovative and limited appeal
is made to the fair dealing exception of the Copyright
Act. What makes this use of scholarly materials fair is
that any “substantial adverse effect“ experienced by publishers is neutralized
by the authors’ substantial reputational benefits of having their work
assigned in university classes. This highly desirable “exploitation” for authors
cumulatively leads to “financial” gains in career development, outweighing any
royalty payments, leading to further sales for the publishers. Even
if, as is likely, authors have given up their copyright
in the work, the Copyright Act still recognizes their moral
rights, which relate, in a highly relevant way in this
case, to the protection of their “honour or reputation” (28.2,
1). This appeal to fair dealing, which only applies to
the academic readings not covered in the first step of
this approach, is further strengthened by the final step.
