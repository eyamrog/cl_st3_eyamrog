In the last years, the Brazilian amazon basin has been
experiencing a great number of new species (Wetzel et al.
2010a, 2010b, 2011, 2012a, 2012b, Burliga et al. 2013, Tremarin
et al. 2013a, 2014a, 2014b, Pereira et al. 2014, 2015,
2017, Almeida et al. 2017, Almeida et al. 2018, Canani
et al. 2018) demonstrating how scant is the knowledge of
the diatoms in this region. Furthermore, the present new records
for the Brazilian Amazon represent a 75% increase in the
total number of records for the region, and strengthen that
the region remains poorly investigated and its biodiversity assessment is
considerably underestimated. Finally, the present study highlights the importance of
a paleolimnological approach as an available tool to assess changes
in biodiversity over a long time scale and increase the
knowledge of diatoms, especially in amazonian ecosystems.
