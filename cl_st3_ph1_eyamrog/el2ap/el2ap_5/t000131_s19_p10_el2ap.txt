In M. glomerata plants, leaf and stem biomass were on
average 40 and 48% higher under I0, I25, and I50
than under I75. Root biomass was 56, 40, and 70%
higher under I0 when compared to plants grown under I25,
I50, and I75, respectively. Moreover, we observed that M. glomerata
plants grown under I0, I25, and I50 had greater leaves
and stems biomass than those observed in M. laevigata plants
(figure 5).
