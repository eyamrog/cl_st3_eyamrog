The income concentration, estimated from the GINI index, showed an
inverse association with the femicide rates in the final spatial
model. Suggesting that in the places with the lowest social
inequality are found the highest rates of femicide. This result
is contradicting the findings of Leite et.al. (2017) 35 that
they reported the presence of a direct relationship between social
inequality and the rates of femicide. On the other hand,
in this same study, it is reported in a peculiar
some regionals exceptions about the trends of social inequity found
as in Esp√≠rito Santo State, which it presented better inequality
and high indicators of the female mortality rates due to
aggression compared to others Brazilian States analyzed 35. Being extremely
important to highlight in this moment that although lost socioeconomic
issues linked to femicide, the factors that permeate violence in
general go beyond poverty and social inequality. This is reinforcing
the multifactorial nature of violence against women, resulting from the
interaction of individual, relational, social, cultural and environmental factors 35,36.
