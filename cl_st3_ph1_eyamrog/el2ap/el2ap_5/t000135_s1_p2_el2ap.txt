Methods: This retrospective ecological study was carried out using Brazilian
municipality data obtained from the information systems of the National
Public Health System. The outcomes were medical appointments, prenatal procedures
and diabetes care. The exposure variable was the occurrence of
the COVID-19 pandemic, based on the first case notified in
Brazil. Multilevel mixed-effects negative binomial regression was used to analyze
the association between the number of procedures per 10,000 inhabitants
and COVID-19.
