Over the years, D&T education has been disproportionately provided to
white students compared to black students (Acosta, 2019) and given
to men compared to women. Prejudice, discrimination, and institutional emphasis
on deficits in special education are probably some of the
causes of this inequality. It affects underrepresented talented students' educational
experiences (Wright, Ford & Young, 2017) and legitimizing myths.
