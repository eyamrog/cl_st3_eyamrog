In addition, students were asked to identify textbooks, for which
training was also provided. Textbooks that were assigned to students,
as well as whole trade books generally, are not considered
as “assigned readings” for the purposes of this study, because
students purchase them separately, compensating the authors and publishers directly
rather than through an Access Copyright tariff as with readings.
