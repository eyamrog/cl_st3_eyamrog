Lowest SLA values indicate an increased leaf thickness as a
result of thicker parenchyma and epidermis under high solar radiances
levels. In M. laevigata plants, we observed a higher leaf
thickness compared to M. glomerata. This increment in leaf thickness,
mainly due to a thicker adaxial epidermis may explain the
reduced photoinhibition and higher photosynthesis in plants developed under I25.
Epidermis attenuates the UV radiation and allows photosynthetically active radiation
(PAR) to diffuse into photosynthetic tissues. For example, Verdaguer et
al. (2017) found a thicker adaxial epidermis in plants stimulated
by UV-A radiation. The development of a thicker adaxial epidermis,
or hypoderm, seems to be a mechanism of protection of
palisade parenchyma against the excessive visible light and a protection
against leaf wilting when the plant is exposed to high
solar radiances levels (Chazdon & Kaufmann 1993). Changes in leaf
structure are crucial for plant growth under different environmental conditions
(Hanba et al. 2002, Schl√ºter et al. 2003). The SD
and SI in Mikania leaves were also affected by solar
radiances levels. The synchronized increases in SD and SI indicated
that solar radiances levels stimulated the process of epidermal cell
differentiation in stomata and that SD and SI alterations were
not caused by reductions in the size or number of
epidermal cells (Woodward 1987). The increased SD and SI in
plants with the lowest retention of solar radiation flux presumably
resulted in an increased gs and A.
