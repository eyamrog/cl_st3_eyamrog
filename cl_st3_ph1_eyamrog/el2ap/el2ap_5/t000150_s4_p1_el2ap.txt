What do these three examples tell us about family and
kinship in a migratory context? What do they say about
the prevailing machinery today? What is, specifically, my point in
this speech? Let's start by the second question: about the
dominant machinery. The intention here is not to criticize or
say they are outdated, or anything to this effect. The
purpose is to expose such working machinery and demonstrate that
they operate with relatively emptied notions of family, from general
considerations and different intentions. None of them wants to explain
the family itself, but other things (from the nation-state to
a group of migrant social relations). This means that, in
order to achieve their explanatory goals and, thus, shed light
on certain issues, this machinery leaves the family gear in
the gloom.
