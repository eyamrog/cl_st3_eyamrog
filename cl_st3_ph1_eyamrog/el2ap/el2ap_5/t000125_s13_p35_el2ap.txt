It is also observed the appearance of three Institutions that
were not listed in the previous years: ESPM (Escola Superior
de Propaganda e Marketing), Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande
do Sul and State University of Maringá. All of them
are well positioned in the ranking, with ESPM taking the
first place, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul
sixth and State University of Maringá the seventh position. It
is a result of large efforts of those Institution in
reporting data to “U-Multirank”. ESPM is not an University, but
a much smaller Academic Institution, which means that deeper studies
needs to be done to understating the effects of the
size of the Institution in the position it takes in
the ranking.
