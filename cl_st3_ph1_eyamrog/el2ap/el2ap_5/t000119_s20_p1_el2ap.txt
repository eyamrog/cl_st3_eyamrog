Differences in function of the salts and the osmotic potentials
of the solutions were observed in the analysis of variance
of the germination data of common rue seeds (figures 1
and 2). The highest germination percentages were found in the
absence of salts (82%), with a significant linear decrease in
the other NaCl concentrations and reaching values below 50% as
of -0.1 MPa CaCl2 potential (figure 1 a).
