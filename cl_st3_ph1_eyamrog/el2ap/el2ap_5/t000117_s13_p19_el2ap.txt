Generally, such items refer to conceptions present in the reports
by Faure (1973) and by Delors (1998) regarding an education
geared towards the development of capacities and competences of learning
with the social milieu. Similarly, item IV, which focuses on
basic education, emphasizes “the strengthening of family ties, bonds of
human solidarity and of reciprocal tolerance” (Brasil, 1996), which once
again refers to the Delors report (1998) as it approaches
the principle of living together.
