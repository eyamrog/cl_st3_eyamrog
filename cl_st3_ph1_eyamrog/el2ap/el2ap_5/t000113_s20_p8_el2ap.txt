The authors of this article evidenced an example of the
above during the aster's project interviews. It aimed to indicate
D&T students in a State School on the French-Brazilian border.
Thus, interviews were carried out with teachers, parents, and students.
In an interview with the mother of two students (a
girl and a boy), the researchers noticed a mother's preference
for the son. The mother described her son's abilities, intelligence,
and talents in great detail but referring to her daughter
- thrifty in words - as obstinate but not intelligent.
However, after the analysis of the interviews, only the student
had D&T characteristics. From the researchers' perspective, this result points
to a legitimizing myth to the social construction of gender
difference (Abad, 2018; Abad et al., 2020).
