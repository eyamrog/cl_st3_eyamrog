Vriesea altobocainensis is morphologically similar to V. sceptrum, a species
from the highlands of Serra da Mantiqueira, in the States
of SÃ£o Paulo, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro. Both
present a robust habit, inflorescences with patent branches, dense and
distichous flowers, short internodes (0.7- 1.5 cm long), and red
primary bracts. Vriesea altobocainensis can be distinguished by a greater
number of inflorescence branches (10-21) and flowers in the branches
[(8-)10-20], orbicular to broadly-ovate upper primary bracts, 6-8 cm wide,
red rachillas, orbicular to broadly-ovate floral bracts, 2-3 cm wide,
obtuse at the apex, and yellow sepals. Vriesea sceptrum has
a lower number of inflorescence branches (13-15) and flowers in
the branches [5-9(-12)], triangular to ovate upper primary bracts, 2-5
cm wide, greenish-orange to orange rachillas, ovate floral bracts, 1.5-2.2
cm wide, acute to obtuse at the apex, and orange
sepals (figure 3).
