The stigma that is linked to abortion must be identified
as the cause of many negative consequences that women bear
due to the delay they experience when accessing the practice
(Fiala y Arthur 2014). The Social Sciences literature focused on
the study of health has determined that “stigma related to
seeking or provision of abortion is increasingly being recognised as
having an effect on how and where women access care
and who provides care” (Ganatra et al., 2017, p.2373). It
has also warned of the need for stigma to “be
considered, acknowledged, and addressed as a predictive factor in abortion
safety and in reproductive morbidity and mortality risk” (Ostrach 2016,
p.1).
