The first aspect regards the dialogue between the reports by
Edgar Faure (1973), by Jacques Delors (1998) and the LDBEN
9.394/1996. Despite the fact that this law has a regulatory
character and the two reports only propose recommendations, we have
found out that the three documents forge a perspective for
a subject who is in constant learning and is no
longer restricted to the institutional and spatial device called school.
Thus, the documents feature enunciations that define the learning society
as defined by Noguera-Ram√≠rez (2009), i.e., as a subject govermentalized
by the experience of a constant whole life learning.
