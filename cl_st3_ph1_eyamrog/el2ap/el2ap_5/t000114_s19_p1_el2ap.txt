Here, we report 59 species of mosses belonging to 38
genera and 22 families (table 1). Nine species are new
occurrences for the state, most notably Physcomitrium falcifolium Müll. Hal.
ex Broth and Atractylocarpus brasiliensis (Müll.Hal.) R.S. Williams which are
classified as Vulnerable and Endangered, respectively, in the last red
list available for Brazil (Martinelli & Moraes 2013). In the
red list of Espírito Santo (Fraga et al. 2019), Brittonodoxa
lithophila (Hornsch.) W.R. Buck, P.E.A.S.Câmara & Carv.-Silva, Itatiella ulei (Broth.
ex Müll. Hal.) G.L.Sm. (Yano & Peralta 2007, Fraga et
al. 2019) and Schizymenium campylocarpum (Hook. & W.-Arn.) Shaw are
treated as Vulnerable, Vulnerable and Critically Endangered, respectively. The richest
families were the Sematophyllaceae (8 species), Leucobryaceae (6spp.), Polytrichaceae and
Bryaceae (5 spp.) (figure 2). We found that the most
species which is about 53% are unique to the Atlantic
Forest and among the others occurrences observed, the most related
biome was the Cerrado and Amazon Forest with 37% and
35%, respectively. When considering the global distribution presented by the
species, 31% of them have a neotropical, 15% a pantropical,
15% a cosmopolitan distribution, while 24% are endemic to Brazil
and the others (15%) have disjunct distributions. Most of our
samples were colonizing terricolous substrate (47%) followed by rupicolous ones
(28%) (figure 3).
