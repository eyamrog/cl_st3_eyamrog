Data were expressed in mean values ± standard deviation as
well with frequency (%) through the SigmaPlot program (Systat Software,
Inc.), version 12.0. After analysis of the parametric assumptions and
statistical differences between the experimental groups, in the different studied
variables, there was a comparative analysis between the microorganisms and
the decoction and extract, as well as between the varied
concentrations applied to both the decoction and the extract, for
one-way ANOVA and one-way ANOVA repeated measures (RM) followed by
Turkey’s test, respectively. The nonparametric data were tested by Kruskal-Wallis
and Friedman tests. Lastly, the statistical differences of the scores
related to the sensorial analysis between groups were obtained by
Wilcoxon’s text. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant.
