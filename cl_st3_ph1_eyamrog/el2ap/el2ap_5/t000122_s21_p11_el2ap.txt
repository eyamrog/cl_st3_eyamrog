After applying the decontamination procedures described in this study, it
is recommended to repeat the procedures if necessary (if contaminants
were found in the culture medium yet). For other species
belonging to the genus Bostrychia, preliminary analyses of thalli immersion
times in 5% liquid detergent and 0.2% sodium hypochlorite are
recommended, so that the macroalgae do not lose pigments nor
damages are caused by overexposure to the chemical compound.
