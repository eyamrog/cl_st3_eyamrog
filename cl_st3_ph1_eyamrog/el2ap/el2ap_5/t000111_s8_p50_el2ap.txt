If one turns to semantics, free relatives are said to
hold maximalizing content (Grosu & Landman, 1998). The main idea
is that free relatives with a realis verb form contain
a semantically CP-internal head and some material external to the
CP, namely a phonologically empty pro. In this situation, the
semantics of the external material is totally determined by the
meaning of the CP (Grosu & Landman, 1998, p. 158).
This being so, the semantics of such a sentence must
contain a maximal reading (preferably universal), as opposed to what
happens in interrogatives or cleft sentences, which hold a definite
reading:
