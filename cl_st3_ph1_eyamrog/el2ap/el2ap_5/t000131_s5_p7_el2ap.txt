In this study, we observed higher dry matter production under
high solar radiances levels in both Mikania species. Similar results
were observed in other lianas species, such as Acacia kamerunensis,
Loeseneriella rowlandii, and Afrobrunnichia erecta (Toledo-Aceves & Swaine 2008), and
Plukenetia volubilis (Cai 2011). Increased biomass accumulation highly depends on
the transport of photoassimilates between organs, and patterns of cell
division and cell expansion. In this study, high light levels
induced A, presumably increasing the production of carbohydrates and dry
matter. Our data showed that plants developed under low light
availability conditions allocated a greater amount of assimilates to aerial
organs in order to reach the light at the upper
canopy layer, optimizing the photosynthetic process within an environment where
low light might limit photosynthesis (Thompson et al. 1992, Walters
et al. 1993). Leaf biomass in both Mikania species was
higher in plants grown under higher light conditions, contradicting the
results of Boeger et al. (2009), where authors showed that
shading stimulated greater leaf biomass production in M. glomerata. In
this study, we also observed higher root biomass at full
sunlight conditions in both species. This response presumably allows greater
absorption of water and nutrients, which may represent a strategy
to increase the ability to withstand higher rates of photosynthesis
and transpiration in bright environments (Poorter 2001, Mielke & Schaffer
2010).
