As one can perfectly see, it is possible to elide
the first element of the apposition in (3a), but not
in (4a); it is also possible to switch the positions
of the nominal and the subordinate sentence in (3b), but
not in (4b). Besides this, the wh-sentence can be extraposed
in (3c), while the extraposition of the appositive clause is
blocked in (4c).
