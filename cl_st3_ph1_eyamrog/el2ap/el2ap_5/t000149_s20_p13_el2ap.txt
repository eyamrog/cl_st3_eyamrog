Regarding the distribution of the species according to their origin,
we can see that the highest percentage of species are
native in all the sites. The PP and FE sites
(Fig. 4a y 4b) presented the highest percentages (87% and
82%, respectively), whereas the RZ (Fig. 4c) had 51% of
native species. The highest percentage of exotic species was in
the RZ (Fig. 4d) and VP, which might be because
they are areas with more frequent traffic, and because, in
general, that is where the landowners and employees live, and/or
because they are areas that are close to the river
which is an important vector in the transport of propagules
and plants in general.
