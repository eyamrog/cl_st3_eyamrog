The Whittaker plots (Figure 9) revealed considerable variation in the
abundance of the amphibian and reptilian species, which was best
adjusted using the log-series model. The most abundant amphibian species
(Table 1) were Ischnocnema parva (N = 617 records; 19.4%
of all amphibians), Hylodes nasus (N = 601; 18.9%), Ischnocnema
guentheri (N = 544; 17.1%), and Crossodactylus gaudichaudii (N =
500; 15.8%). The most abundant reptiles were the lizards Enyalius
brasiliensis (N = 55; 48.2% of all reptiles) and Ecpleopus
gaudichaudii (N = 15; 13.2%), representing 61.4% of all the
reptiles recorded during the surveys (Table 2). The most abundant
snakes were Bothrops jararacussu (N = 8; 7.0% of all
reptiles), Thamnodynastes cf. nattereri (N = 7; 6.1%), and Bothrops
jararaca (N = 6; 5.3%).
