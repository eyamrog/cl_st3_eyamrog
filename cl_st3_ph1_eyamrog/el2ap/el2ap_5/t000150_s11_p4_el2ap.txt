Based on these critizings from Schneider, a fresh impetus to
the studies on kinship came to light, concerned to accept
the various and different relationships as kinship relations: friendship, companionship,
shared suffering etc. without mentioning the appreciation of same-sex relationships
as kinship relations. We have an emphasis on the plasticity
of relations as plasticity of kinship. This little digression makes
us think how family is a very limited label for
a large set of relationships that could be defined as
kinship.
