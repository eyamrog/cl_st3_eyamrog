Since we wanted to investigate relationships between latent variables, we
chose the technique Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM).
As the variables related to manifest variables are qualitative, assuming
dichotomous values, and this technique is not appropriate for measuring
constructs under this condition (Hair et al., 2016), we initially
conducted the Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) to identify the underlying
governance structure in NPO.
