(A new species of Vriesea Lindl. (Bromeliaceae) from the Atlantic
Rainforest of SÃ£o Paulo State, Brazil). A new species of
Vriesea Lindl. is described and illustrated. Vriesea altobocainensis is only
known for the Atlantic Forest of Serra da Bocaina. It
is a robust epiphyte, characterized by a reddish inflorescence, and
floral and primary bracts with an orbicular and broadly ovate
shape; morphologically, it is close to Vriesea altodaserrae L.B.Sm. and
Vriesea sceptrum Mez. However, the new species can be distinguished
from these others mainly for the color, dimensions and shape
of floral and primary bracts, number of inflorescence branches and
number of flowers per branch.
