The Fiscal Council is the supervisory body of NPO’s accounting
and financial management, involving its constituent aspects (election and mandate)
and attributions (assessment of the financial statements). Thus, it is
different from the Board, whose theoretical domain refers to keeping
NPO’s purposes, while the Fiscal Council deals with the supervision
of administration acts, providing opinions on the organization's financial statements
(Lamb, 2002). The presence of a Fiscal Council, duly constituted,
can be an additional line of defense for the principal's
interest.
