In Cosmopolitanism and the Age of School Reform: Science, Education
and Making Society by Making the Child, Thomas Popkewitz (2008)
analyses the discourses around education at the beginning of the
twenty-first century by looking into education reform texts written in
the USA and Europe. An aspect common to all such
reform plans is the formulation of the idea of the
“lifelong learner”, which updates ideas present in educational discourse since
the beginning of the twentieth century, related to the aims
of coaching, in individuals, the predisposition to rationally plan his
or her own life and solve problems by means of
the involvement with collaborative communities.
