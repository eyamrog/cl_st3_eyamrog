Only one of the reptiles recorded in the present study,
the tortoise Chelonoidis denticulatus, is considered to be under some
threat of extinction, being classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN
(2020), although it is considered to be Least Concern in
Brazil (ICMBIO 2018). The occurrence of Chelonoidis denticulatus was recorded
in the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro in 1820
by Prince Maximilian zu Wied-Neuwied, who found carapaces of this
species on the sandy plains in the north of the
municipality of Cabo Frio (Vanzolini 1994, Vargas-Ram√≠rez et al. 2010,
Vanzolini & Myers 2015). While C. denticulatus was originally recorded
in the Atlantic Forest, it appears to have been eradicated
subsequently from the forests of eastern Brazil (Vanzolini & Myers
2015). This species is being reintroduced into the PNT by
the Refauna Project (Refauna 2019).
