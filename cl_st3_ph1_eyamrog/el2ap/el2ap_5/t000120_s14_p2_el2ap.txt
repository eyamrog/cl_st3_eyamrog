Description of The Experiment - twenty-five continuous 7 x 7
m plots were delimited with string and stakes. The grass
was mowed with a brush cutter and removed from the
site after ten permanent plots were selected by the Research
Randomizer system (https://www.randomizer.org/): five treatment plots and five control plots.
An integrated soil sample from a depth of 0-20 cm
was collected according to the method laid out by De
Arruda et al. (2014) for the determination of physical and
chemical properties. Two composite samples (October 12th, 2017) from each
of the ten plots were collected from a depth of
0-20 cm with the aid of an auger (De Arruda
et al. 2014) for chemical (organic matter), physical (humidity) and
microbiological analyses, totaling 20 samples.
