The choice of these areas was based on two factors:
its local character and the fact that the coverage area
for SciELO CI is more extensive in the Health, since
in the case of SciELO Spain, it is restricted to
Public and Collective Health. The reliance on SciELO CI is
important because it is a relatively new citation index, as
well as being one of the few regional indexes, that
are still not widely used in bibliometric studies. Furthermore, the
study of the citation flow between languages is of great
value if undertaken in a regional citation index.
