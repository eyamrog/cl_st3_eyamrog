The history of higher education in Brazil can be traced
to the arrival, during the Peninsular War, of the Portuguese
royal family in the colony in 1808 and the subsequent
growth of a bourgeois class. During the nineteenth century, eleven
different universities were founded, starting with the School of Surgery
and Anatomy in Bahia (DeHumerez and Jankevicius 2015). At that
time, higher education was conceived as preparation for professional practice
and was reserved for the white bourgeois elite.
