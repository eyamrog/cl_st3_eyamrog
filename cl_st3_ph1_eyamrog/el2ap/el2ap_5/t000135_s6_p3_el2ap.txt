The significant decrease in PHC during the pandemic period under
analysis may further compromise the population's health conditions. Continuous care
during pregnancy - prenatal care - has been reported as
a protective factor for maternal and child health 16, 17
and has been negatively affected during the entire pandemic period
in 2020. Outcomes for the increase in neonatal, postnatal and
premature birth mortality have been associated with the purview of
PHC 18. Moreover, hospital admissions for conditions within the ambit
of PHC have been presented as a mark of effectiveness
for these services 19, 20. These conditions are represented by
an extensive list that includes chronic diseases and their complications.
More specifically in Brazil, it has been possible to observe
a significant reduction in hospitalizations due to care-sensitive conditions in
recent years 21. However, a reduction in the rate of
these improvements, as well as difficulties in the management of
chronic diseases, has been pointed to as a major concern
for PHC in the country 22.
