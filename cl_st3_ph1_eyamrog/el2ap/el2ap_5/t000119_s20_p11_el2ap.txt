These results are of ecological importance because insights on the
tolerance of plant species to the presence of salts are
essential to define the type of crop that should be
cultivated in a particular environment, especially in saline areas, as
well as implement appropriate management and irrigation techniques for each
environment, avoiding salinity intensification (Pereira et al. 2017). The low
tolerance to water stress provides the common rue a non-adaptive
character and indicates that the species has reduced establishment capacity
in locations with water restriction due to the narrow germination
limits.
