For studies with species of Bostrychia, as well as other
estuarine macroalgae, it is recommended to remove sediment in the
field due to high amount of sediments frequently found on
macroalgae from these environments. Afterward in laboratory, remaining adhered sediments
and biota must be eliminated following protocols.
