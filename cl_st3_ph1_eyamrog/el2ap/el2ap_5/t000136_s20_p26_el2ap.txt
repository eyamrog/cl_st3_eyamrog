Second, according to Sarstedt, Hair, Cheah, Becker & Ringle (2019),
we assessing the measurement model of the higher-order construct, represented
by the relationships between the higher-order component and its lower-order
components: unidimensionality (Cronbach’s alpha between 0.7 and 0.9, Dillon-Goldstein’s rho
between 0.7 and 0.9, and the dominance of the first
eigenvalue), convergent validity (outer loadings higher than 0.7, and the
average variance extracted higher than 0.5) and discriminant validity (outer
loadings on a construct higher than all its cross loadings
with other constructs, and the square root of the average
variance extracted of each construct higher than its highest correlation
with any other construct – Fornell-Larcker criterion).
