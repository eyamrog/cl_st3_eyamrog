The compilation of the SciELO Citation Index – is a
recent undertaking that has replaced its older global reference database
– WoS Core Collection. For a long time, this endeavor
was justified simply on the grounds that it could make
scientific output visible and available in open access – which
in itself is very significant, insofar as it provides greater
exposure to nationally published journals. Furthermore, one feature that adds
to the credibility of the SciELO collection is its selectivity,
which is the result of the strict assessment procedures and
criteria applied by the scientific advisory committee of each country
that belongs to the SciELO Network. Unfortunately, many previous studies
have shown that research published, by “high-quality”, national journals receives
fewer citations than commercial “high impact” journals.
