For the epidermis analysis, lower epidermis (hypoestomatic leaves) were detached
from mesophyll using the Jeffrey solution (10% chromic acid and
10% nitric acid, 1:1). Samples were stained with safranin for
30 seconds and mounted in glycerin 50% (Kraus & Arduin
1997). Samples were observed using a microscope QUIMIS (Q720 ED)
and photographed. We counted the number of epidermal cells and
stomata and calculated the stomatal density (SD) and stomatal index
(SI) using the software AnatiQuanti 2.0 (Laboratory of Plant Anatomy/UFV).
Stomatal index (SI) was calculated according to the equation: <>,
where: SN = stomata number; EC = number of epidermal
cells
