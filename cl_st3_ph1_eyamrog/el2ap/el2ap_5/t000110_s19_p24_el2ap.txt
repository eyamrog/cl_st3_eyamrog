This material is identified as Achnanthes cf. inflata (Kützing) Grunow
due to its representative specimens show slightly less rounded ends
than the ones described by Grunow (1868). However, other morphological
characteristics coincided with Grunow (1868) original description. Our specimens have
wider valve ends than Achnanthes inflata var. elata (Leuduger-Fortmorel) Hustedt
(1937: 206), and differ from Achnanthes coarctata (Brébisson ex W.Smith)
Grunow (1880: 20) by the presence of a central inflation
at the valve margin and by being not constricted as
is the latter. The species was found in just 2%
of the core samples, and reached 1% maximum abundance in
samples corresponding to the Late Holocene (~625 cal. yr BP).
This is the first report for the Brazilian Amazon.
