The conclusion is that Brazilian Portuguese sentences, such as the
ones highlighted here, evidence the existence of appositive free relatives.
The subordinate wh-sentences in (1) are to be considered examples
of this kind of occurrence. The prediction this claim makes
is that the wh-sentence in (1) must be subject to
matching requirements (see Marchesan, 2008; Medeiros Junior, 2005, 2014), which
seems to be confirmed by the data analysis. Moreover, if
those sentences are in fact free relatives, they must contain
maximalizing interpretation, which in Brazilian Portuguese means having universal meaning
(see Medeiros Junior, 2005, 2006; 2009, 2014), a characteristic that
also seems to be endorsed by data evaluation.
