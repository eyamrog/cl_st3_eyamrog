From one perspective, inequalities between blacks and whites are directly
related to colonial education. On the one hand, the white
color remained one of the discriminatory elements when it was
considered the color of the ruling class, and a policy
of valuing white women was created, which caused difficulties for
black women (Ribeiro, 1987). On the other hand, the lack
of schools and teachers and the almost absolute lack of
interest in black education in the colonial period and the
Empire meant that black women had more limited educational opportunities
(Gon√ßalves, 2000). Currently, these discriminatory practices against them are translated
into unequal education, lower than average wages in the country,
and a higher rate of unemployment among black women. Given
this, black women's educational achievements are translated into proportionately lower
occupational and income gains (Hasenbalg, 2005).
