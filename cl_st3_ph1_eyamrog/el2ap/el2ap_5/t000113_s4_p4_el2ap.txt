The situation is even more complicated for these students, knowing
that many private and public schools have not implemented the
AEE Rooms. We observed it in the field research (Abad,
2018) despite public policies that oblige to assist D&T students.
And, therefore, they do not comply with Resolution CNE/CEB nยบ
4/2009 of the National Council of Education, which obliges, in
its Article 5, the implementation of the AEE, primarily, in
the resource rooms the school's own multifunctional in the inverse
shift of schooling.
