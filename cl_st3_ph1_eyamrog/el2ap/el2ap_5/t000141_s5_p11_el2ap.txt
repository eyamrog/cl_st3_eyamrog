The number of simple indicators adopted in each state was
significantly variable (2 to 11) but should not be used
to analyze state plans' effectiveness in isolation. It was possible
to identify detailed and structured plans with very different amounts
of indicators, such as SÃ£o Paulo and Rio Grande do
Sul with, respectively, 5 and 11 indicators. In addition to
government measures that are not formalized in documents but that
interfere in the decision-making process, some components of the plans
reflect more effective policies in tackling the pandemic, such as:
inclusion of parameters to monitor the policies for testing, defining
and reassessing the cutoff points for the indicators, caution in
defining the set of criteria necessary for the transition from
flexibilization phases, in addition to the construction of a regionalized
policy, which allows the management of resources and the adjustment
of the rigor of the measures according to the epidemiological
situation, in a micro and macro context.
