In the text, the way nature and “natural” space are
considered educational in themselves stands out. The child’s education is
presented as the result of the possibility of playing freely
within a natural space. In the educational proposal present in
Demmuring Childhood, teaching carried out by the teacher is not
mentioned. Nature teaches and the child educates itself in the
free living together among its peers, in natural space. The
publication relates the Chilean experience carried out by Fundação Pátio
Vivo, whose “team of architects, landscape designers and educators believes
that the space is like a third teacher, who inspires
the children’s actions and helps them to learn and to
develop” (Barros, 2018, p. 96).
