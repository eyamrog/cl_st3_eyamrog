The state capital, Rio de Janeiro, which has a population
of more than six million inhabitants, includes one of the
world’s largest urban parks, the Parque Nacional da Tijuca (PNT),
which is the only Brazilian national park located within an
urban zone. Like other coastal ranges within the Atlantic Forest
domain, the Tijuca massif has a rich network of water
courses (Coelho Netto 2005), which favors the occurrence of amphibians.
During the 18th and 19th centuries, however, the forest of
this area was almost totally destroyed for the production of
charcoal, and the establishment of sugarcane and coffee plantations (Rocha
et al. 2003, Rocha 2017). As a result, many of
the water sources that supplied the city began to dry
up (Abreu & Rodrigues 2010, Rocha 2017). It seems likely
that fragments of forest persisted in many of the more
inaccessible areas within the Tijuca massif, in particular, the highest
mountain peaks and the steepest valleys (Coimbra-Filho et al. 1973).
In addition to providing seeds of native species for the
subsequent reforestation of the area (Coimbra-Filho et al. 1973, Abreu
& Rodrigues 2010), these forest remnants probably also provided important
refuges for many local animal species (e.g., Rocha et al.
2003). The deforested areas once covered by plantations were almost
completely reconstituted by a reforestation project – the first major
project of its kind anywhere in the world – which
involved the planting of 100,000 trees, beginning in the second
half of the 19th century during the Brazilian Empire period.
This initiative resulted in the establishment of an exuberant forest,
which was converted into a national park in 1961 (Brasil
1961).
