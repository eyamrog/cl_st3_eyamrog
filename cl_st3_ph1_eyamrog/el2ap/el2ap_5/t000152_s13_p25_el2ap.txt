It is not only job, income and digital limitations that
threaten student retention in higher education during the pandemic. Student
autonomy, inadequate home environments to accompany synchronous and/or asynchronous classes,
and the difficulties in concentration that result from discontinuity require
cognitive adaptations to the teaching-learning process. Changes in working hours,
the additional physical and emotional fatigue that affects those who
are still working, and various mental health issues caused or
exacerbated by social isolation require physical and psycho-emotional adaptations to
mitigate the challenges of studying during the pandemic (Sahu 2020).
