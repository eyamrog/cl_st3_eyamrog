We need additional research to capture all costs and benefits
of NPO governance. While we showed that a better governance
is associated with more Donations, we did not examine if
a better governance improves NPOâ€™s effectiveness. Although difficult, it is
essential to assess how well an NPO is carrying out
its institutional mission of serving its target community, and what
factors, besides governance, can help it reach its goals.
