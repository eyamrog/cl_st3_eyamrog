Nadia Kubota (2014) shows us how the relationship between immigrants
from Okinawa and from "traditional" Japan has always been tense
in Campo Grande (MS/ Brazil). Living together was difficult, and
the Second World War marked a profound rupture between "defeatist"
and "victorist", between those who believed in Japan's defeat and
those who did not - conflict known for having generated
Shindo Renmei, a small victorist army aiming at punishing the
“defeatist”. In Campo Grande, just like in several other places
of Japanese/Okinawan migration, there has been a division between Okinawans/
“defeatist” and Japanese/ “victorist”.
