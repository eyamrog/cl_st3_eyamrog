Vriesea Lindl. is included in the subfamily Tillandsioideae, which, based
on phylogenetic and morphological studies, has gone through segregation, with
the establishment of new genera (Barfuss et al. 2016). In
this new circumscription, Vriesea is characterized mainly for the presence
of a stigma of the convolute blade II type (with
lobes Â± fused, spreading, strongly broadened, infundibuliform to umbrella-shaped), petals
usually bearing basal appendages (Barfuss et al. 2016). They are
epiphytic plants, terrestrial or rupiculous, and are mainly distributed throughout
South America, with one of the main diversity centres being
the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (Costa et al. 2007). According to
Forzza et al. (2015), Vriesea is the richest genus of
Bromeliaceae in Brazil with almost 230 species (Gouda et al.
cont. updated). It is also among the most diverse genera
(ca. 170 spp.) within the Atlantic Rainforest domain (BFG 2018,
Flora do Brasil 2020 under construction).
