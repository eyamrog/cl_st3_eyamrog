With the shift of the agricultural frontier to the north
of Patagonia at the end of the 20th century, the
valley areas were transformed into important agricultural production systems, mainly
with orchards and pastures. The construction of complex irrigation systems
facilitated the advancement of these enterprises. Likewise, the non-irrigated dryland
areas were used for extensive grazing of domestic herbivores. The
food source for these herbivores is the spontaneous vegetation that
grows on the plateau, especially in the case of cattle
rearing (Zeberio 2012).
