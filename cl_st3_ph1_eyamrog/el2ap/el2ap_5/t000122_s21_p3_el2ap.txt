We observed a biomass loss in B. binderi at the
second weighing (after one week of cultivation) in all treatments
with chemical procedures (figure 1). This biomass loss occurred possibly
due to negative effects of the chemical compounds on the
macroalga. However, at the third weighing (after three weeks of
cultivation) we observed recovery of the thalli with biomass gain
(figure 1). Final weights of the thalli did not differ
among treatments.
