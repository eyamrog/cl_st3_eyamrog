Table 3 includes the results of the growth curve utilizing
the hydroalcoholic extract and the decoction of L. ferrea to
strains that presented sensibility utilizing the best concentration (100 mg/mL),
which was noticed in the diffusion technique in wells. In
the decoction, we noticed that the E. feacalis strain obtained
a reduction in the absorbance value of 0.24. Although the
S. aureus had its absorbance value reduced in 0.07, there
was no statistical difference. Since for the extract there was
a reduction in the bacterial number considering the absorbance after
24 hours, in the strains of P. aeruginosa, we obtained
a difference in the absorbance value of 0.36. It was
verified that although there was an increase in the absorbance
value of Corynebacterium spp., E. feacalis and Salmonella Typhimurium of
0.06, 0.03, and 0.14, respectively, these did not present statistical
difference as for the positive control.
