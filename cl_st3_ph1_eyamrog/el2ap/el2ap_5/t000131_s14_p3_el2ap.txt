Gas exchange measurements - Net photosynthesis rate (A, µmol m-2
s-1), transpiration rate (E, mmol m-2 s-1), and stomatal conductance
(gs, mol m-2 s-1) were evaluated daily from 8:00 to
11:00 hours in fully expanded leaves using an infrared gas
analyzer model LCpro+ (ADC BioScientific, Ltd., UK). The measurements were
made under ambient conditions of radiation, [CO2], and air temperature.
The intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE; µmol mol-1) was estimated from
gas exchange (A/gs) data.
