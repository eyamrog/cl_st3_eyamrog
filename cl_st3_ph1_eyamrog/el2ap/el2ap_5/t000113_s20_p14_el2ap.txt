According to TDS, legitimating myths (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999) are
a combination of prejudice, assumptions of the inferiority of marginalized
groups, and political conservatism. It leads to the formation of
persistent ideological myths, which are institutionalized and used to legitimize
existing structures of inequality as fair and desirable (Islam, 2014).
TDS, in this sense, explains how common factors such as
cultural ideologies, discriminatory behaviors, social roles, and psychological propensities for
group prejudice combine to maintain social group hierarchy (Pratto et
al., 2000). Thus, providing a clearer understanding of why groups
become oppressed and how they remain oppressed: The continuation of
the status quo of this inequality is not individual, but
systemic (Acosta, 2019).
