Eggs of H. nana remained present after treatment, increasing the
frequency of this helminth from 23.3% to 43.8%, although there
was not a significant increase. They present little resistance in
the peridomestic external environment, and the transmission of himenolepiasis usually
occurs in intradomiciliary environments. The treatment indicated for this parasitosis
is carried out with praziquantel24 and imidazole derivatives such as
ABZ may have questionable effectiveness. Cultural characteristics of indigenous peoples,
such as the large number of people living in the
same house, together with poor hygiene conditions, can explain the
results observed.5,6
