All experiences are the results of the choices. For instance,
as Erturk (2015), pointed out, the allocation of available resources
to defense and military expenditures leads to the neglect of
social development and human rights while bringing about an increase
in poverty and violence. Disintegrations and fragmentation experienced, destroyed livelihoods
lead to an increase in male unemployment in some areas.
Losing socio-economic status and the balance of power are tried
to be compensated in the form of violence against women
and girls.
