The highest production of aboveground biomass was observed at 90
DAT in M. glomerata under I50 (45.37 g DW), and
for M. laevigata under I0 (28.19 g DW) (figure 5
a). At 150 DAT, shoot biomass in M. glomerata was
higher under I0, followed by plants grew under I25 and
I50 (figure 5 b). However, in M. laevigata plants, the
highest aboveground dry mass was observed in plants developed under
I25 followed by I0. At 90 and 150 DAT, we
observed that under I0, root dry mass was higher compared
to other treatments and independent of species (figure 5). Both
species at 90 DAT showed higher leaf biomass production when
compared to other part plants, however, at 150 DAT, the
stem biomass was higher than leaf dry mass (figure 5).
At the end of the experiment (150 DAT), increased production
of biomass was observed under I25 in M. laevigata compared
with other solar radiances treatments. In M. laevigata, leaf, stem,
and root biomass of plants grown under I75 were 38,
48, and 70%, respectively, lower when compared with plants grown
under I25. Compared with full sun treatments (I0), root biomass
showed a 54% and 69% reduction under I50 and I75
treatments, respectively (figure 5).
