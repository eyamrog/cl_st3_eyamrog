Another important aspect of the ranking is that it does
not have any Indicator based in “reputation” surveys, like other
popular rankings, as “QS” and “THE”, therefore its results are
all based in very objective Indicators. A negative point is
that there is a large number of Indicators that are
based on questionnaires that must be sent by the Institutions,
and many of them do not make regular reports. Therefore,
lack of data is a common problem in this ranking.
