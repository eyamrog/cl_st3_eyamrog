Regarding the total length of common rue seedlings (figure 2
a) a reduction from 5.1 cm (control) to 1.14 cm
was verified when seedlings were exposed to -0.4 MPa NaCl.
On the other hand, normal seedlings were not observed from
-0.3 MPa CaCl2 salt exposition. Similarly, the dry weight decreased
from 0.9 mg to 0 mg when subjected to calcium
chloride solution (figure 2 b). In NaCl solution, although there
was a reduction in seedlings length, it was not observed
significant difference on dry weight (figure 2 b). Unfortunately, as
the amount of material was very small (mg) errors (human
or from the equipment) may have occurred when weighing the
material.
