Brazilian Portuguese data provide evidence to the claim I make
in this paper that there are appositive free relatives, contrary
to what Emonds (1979) states, for whom free relatives cannot
have appositive semantics or syntax. I argue there are reasons
to believe the wh-sentence evidenced in the title of this
paper is in fact a free relative that carries appositive
content, considering issues such as distribution, matching, the nature of
quem and semantic content. The quem-type sentence I put into
analysis in the present paper differs from an ordinary (headed)
appositive relative clause for it seems to be juxtaposed to
the nominal it relates to, being equivalent to it, a
condition that leads to the impossibility of a relativization process
in Kaynesâ€™s (1994) terms for the derivation of this kind
of sentence.
