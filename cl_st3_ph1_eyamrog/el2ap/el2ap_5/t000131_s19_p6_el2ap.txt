Leaf anatomy - The effects of retention of solar radiation
flux on leaf anatomy were similar in both species. The
thickness of the adaxial epidermis (AdE) and mesophyll (palisade and
spongy parenchyma) decreased while the retention of solar radiation flux
increased (table 1). The AdE was approximately 1.2 and 1.3-fold
higher in I0 compared with I75 for M. glomerata and
M. laevigata, respectively. Under I0, I25, and I50 the AdE
was on average 1.4 and 1.7-fold higher in M. laevigata
than M. glomerata at 90 and 150 DAT, respectively. Under
I75, M. laevigata also showed a higher AdE. However, the
values were 1.2 and 1.4-fold (90 and 150 DAT, respectively)
higher than those observed in M. glomerata. Under I0 palisade
and spongy parenchyma (150 DAT), were 10 and 17% higher
in M. laevigata (table 1).
