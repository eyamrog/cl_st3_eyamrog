Of the species identified, 70.67% were native and 29.33% were
exotic (Fig. 2a). The exotic species are found in areas
of greater disturbance, such as tracks, roadsides, fencelines and power
lines. These are sectors in the natural areas where vehicular
traffic is very frequent, such as trucks and agricultural machinery
that come from areas outside the Middle Valley, which are
a means of transporting seeds and other propagules of these
foreign species. The disturbance caused by clearing also modifies the
structure and composition of the plant communities, for example, the
cleaning of fences and clearing of the surrounding area, studied
by Peralta et al. (unpublished) in two agricultural establishments in
the Middle Valley, which is a pattern repeated throughout the
area.
