Considering the valve shape, Navicula notha Wallace resembles Navicula cryptocephala
KÃ¼tzing (1844: 95), but differs in having smaller valves, with
an inconspicuous central area in the smaller specimens, and rhombic
shape in the larger ones (Potapova 2011). The species occurred
only in 3% of the core samples, and reaches 1.3%
maximum abundance. It is present in samples corresponding to the
Late Holocene (~2.909 cal. yr BP). This is the first
report of its occurrence in the Brazilian Amazon.
