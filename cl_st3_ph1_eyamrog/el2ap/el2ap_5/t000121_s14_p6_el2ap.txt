Data collection was conducted using an invitation sent via social
networks, mainly Facebook and Instagram. The research was approved by
CONEP, the National Research Ethics Committee, under approval number [omitted

population and the public was asked to forward the survey
to other people in their social life. A Free and
Informed Consent Form was located at the beginning of the
questionnaire, which could only be completed if the individual agreed
to participate. In order to be a short screening, the
average response time was 5 minutes, according to the automatic
registration of the platform used for data collection.
