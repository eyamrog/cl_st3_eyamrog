RGRs of the thalli were calculated with the weights obtained
between the second and third weighing (after recovery of the
thalli). Significant differences among RGRs of the thalli immersed in
1% povidone iodine for 30 seconds (1.69% day-1 ± 0.26)
from those immersed for 15 seconds (0.76% day-1 ± 0.25)
and 2 minutes (0.65% day-1 ± 0.63) were observed, but
when compared to the control (1.15% day-1 ± 0.42) and
1 minute (1.13% day-1 ± 0.63) there were no significant
differences. Thalli immersed in 0.2% sodium hypochlorite for 5 minutes
had the lowest growth (0.46% day-1 ± 0.14), being significantly
different from the thalli growth immersed for 2 minutes (1.19%
day-1 ± 0.30), 1 minute (1.02% day-1 ± 0.22) and
control (figure 2). These data indicate that immersion in 1%
povidone iodine did not affect negatively the thalli growth, whereas
immersion in 0.2% sodium hypochlorite for 5 minutes affected.
