Our data indicated that M. glomerata and M. laevigata plants
grown under conditions of retention of solar radiation flux of
up to 50% had higher A than plants grown under
I75. Lower A under I75 is presumably the result of
a combination of many factors such as thinner leaves, low
stomatal density, decreased gs, and low light intensity. These factors
may result in lower intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), Rubisco activity,
and electron transporters (Lambers et al. 1998). Notably, plants grown
under I25 exhibited higher A values than plants grown under
full sunlight (I0). This effect was observed in both species,
suggesting that the irradiation growth condition was too high at
I0, which potentially induced dynamic photoinhibition. Fv/Fm is a parameter
that indicates photoinhibition level, and smaller values than 0.75 indicate
photoinhibition with a concomitant reduction of the maximum quantum efficiency
of PSII (Bolhàr-Nordenkampf & Öquist 1993). Under full sunlight conditions,
the reduced Fv/Fm at noon and subsequent recovery at the
end of the day is evidence of dynamic reversible photoinhibition
(Bolhàr-Nordenkampf & Öquist 1993). The dynamic photoinhibition (inactivation of PSII)
is an efficient defense mechanism because the increase in non-photochemical
dissipation when the influx of CO2 is reduced (due to
stomatal closure), prevents the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
and photooxidative damage (Choudhury & Behera 2001).
