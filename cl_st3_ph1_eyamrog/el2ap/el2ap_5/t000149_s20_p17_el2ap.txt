Finally, the SÃ¶rensen similarity index (SI) was calculated for the
four sampled sites (Tab. 4). In general terms, the SI
indicates that the four sites shared at least one species.
The highest similarity was observed between the PM and PB,
which is logical because those areas are in contact, whereas
the PM and the ZR shared a smaller number of
species. In relation to this last comparison, low similarity values
were also expected, mainly due to the environmental differences between
the two sites. Moreover, the shared taxa (24 sp.) correspond
to species that were also found in other sites and,
in general, they are species that grow in disturbed environments
and whose main characteristics are their great plasticity for occupying
those environments.
