If we consider the whole que sentence in (17) to
have taken the place of the elided anchor working as
the complement of the verb disse, it becomes clear that
the subordinate clause in (15) is being directly selected by
the matrix verb, this – of course – due to
the selectional properties of a verb like disse (we could
call it a CP with a DP-like nature). (16), by
its turn, might be different from (15), because the ellipsis
of the anchor is not allowed, as (18) shows. This
constitutes evidence that the que sentence in this case cannot
be associated to the position of the anchor, since it
is an ordinary CP (not a DP-like CP) in that
context – when a DP is being selected by the
matrix verb. Moreover, the asymmetry between (15) and (16) seems
to be confirmed by the contrast observed in (19) and
(20) bellow:
