There is some overlap between textbooks and readings on the
syllabuses, with 361 (10.6 percent of all syllabuses) asking students
to purchase a textbook while also listing at least one
type of required reading. Similar to a textbook, when a
complete trade book (such as a novel, play, or nonfiction
work) was assigned on a syllabus to students, rather than
chapters or excerpts from such books, the book was not
part of our calculations. This is because when students purchase
a trade book, the publishers and authors are compensated by
that transaction and need not figure in tariff calculations for
assigned readings.
