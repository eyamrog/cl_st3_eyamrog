Diurnal courses of chlorophyll a fluorescence - In both species,
and under high shading conditions (I75), Fv/Fm values were higher
compared with all other treatments (figure 2). We observed that
in both species at 60 and 90 DAT only plants
developed under I0 showed a decreased Fv/Fm ratio, with values
below 0.75, indicating the occurrence of dynamic photoinhibition (figure 2
a-d). At 120 and 150 DAT, Fv/Fm reduction was observed
under all treatments, except under I75 (figure 2 e-h). The
recovery of this parameter was observed at 18:00 hours, except
in M. glomerata plants grown under I0 and I25, and
M. laevigata I0 (150 DAT), indicating a lower rate of
recovery. In all treatments, the lowest Fv/Fm value was observed
between 12:00 and 16:00 hours in plants grown under the
full sun (figure 2).
