The decrease of the ACSC rate in the city of
Rio de Janeiro suggests a possible effect of the changes
induced by the new PNAB. Federal flexibility of public policies
possibly allows for misguided and little evidence-based decision-making for the
management of local resources. It directly impacts the population's health
and increases the risk of hospitalizations for manageable causes in
PHC. We also believe that more studies related to this
indicator should be carried out to assess PHC. It allows
us to assess groups' suitability as sensitive to care at
this level of care, such as anemias and nose, throat,
and ear infections. In the end, the world can learn
some lessons from the Brazilian experience. Community-based primary care can
work if done correctly.
