In Brazil, due to the high rate and speed of
contamination, it was necessary to adopt restrictive measures to the
public and private sectors throughout the country, with maintenance only
of essential activities and adherence to public health recommendations and
social distancing from WHO.(7) These measures showed that tackling the
COVID-19 pandemic encompasses health aspects and social, political, and economic
elements.(8) In this context, the articulated and coordinated action between
Brazilian federative units (FU) - states and the Federal District,
in compliance with the guidelines of competent bodies and foreign
experiences, are of paramount importance, as slow or ineffective government
responses burden public health and can cost thousands of human
lives.
