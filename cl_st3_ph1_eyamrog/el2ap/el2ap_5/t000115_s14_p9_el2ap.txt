After the first collection of fecal material (Initial Examination), a
single control measure, which consisted of two antiparasitic treatments, was
applied in school-age children. Albendazole (ABZ), a carbamatobenzimidazole agent with
anthelmintic and anti-protozoan activity, was used to treat intestinal and
tissue parasites. For each student, a single dose of 400
mg of ABZ was administered by the local UBS health
team, in two doses with an interval of 90 days
between them, according to the protocol adopted by the Litoral
Sul DSEI, to control general parasitic infections. Treatment coverage in
the population was high and all children involved in the
study received the medication. Thirty days after the second dose
of ABZ, the 2nd Examination was carried out by collecting
new stool samples from the students.
