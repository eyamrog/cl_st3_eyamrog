Looking first at the Teaching and Learning Dimension (green), it
is observed that it is the Dimension with the largest
number of missing data. Twelve Institutions do not have any
data reported in this Dimension, four Institutions have two, two
Institutions have one, one Institution has three (ESPM) and only
one Institution (Federal University of Ceará) have all the data
available. All data used in this Dimension comes from questionnaires
reported by the Institutions, which explains why it has a
large number of missing data. It means that, to improve
positions in this Dimension, the first step to make is
to report data. It is particularly noted that ESPM appeared
in 2020 for the first time in this ranking, and
it is already the second one in reporting data, which
indicates a high interest of the Institution in this ranking.
Looking at the performances of the Institutions that have a
large number of data, we can see that Federal University
of Ceará has good grades, 1 C, 2 B and
1 A. ESPM also has a good performance, with 1
C, 1 B and 1 A.
