We conducted an exploration of the data for the 19
groups of causes in the three periods. To do this,
we calculate the means, standard deviations, and measures of variability
(quartiles) for each pair at the three periods. In this
way, we visually inspect these measurements, using box plots for
each group in the three periods. We were able to
compare the groups with the average and standard deviation measurements.
So that we could assume that this comparison of means
was valid, we analyzed the normality of the distribution data
using the Shapiro-Wilk adherence test. We used an inferential statistic
known as the Levene test to accept the homoscedasticity of
data distribution. Finally, we were interested not only in whether
there was a statistically significant difference between groups but also
in understanding the difference between pairs of groups (period one
vs. period 2; period one vs. period three and period
two vs. period 3). Thus, we chose not only to
use the ANOVA test but a Post-Hoc test. For that,
we used the Tukey test.
