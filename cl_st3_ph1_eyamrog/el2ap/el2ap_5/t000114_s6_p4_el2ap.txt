Corroborating this, we found greater diversity of mosses and a
higher number of families exclusive to one altitudinal zone between
1,500m - 2,100m altitude. As also observed in others remains
of the Atlantic Forest, such as in Rio de Janeiro
(Costa & Lima 2005), in the Serra de Ibitipoca (Siviero
2010), an area in transition with the Cerrado, in the
Serra do Cipó (Yano & Peralta 2011) and in the
north of São Paulo (Visnadi 2005). The diversity of microhabitats
and microclimates found in these areas favors the establishment of
a high richness of bryophytes (Costa & Lima 2005). Therefore,
studies such as this one must be continued in this
domain, especially in the Espírito Santo State, which has a
diversity of environments still unexplored. The importance of the data
for the state is demonstrated in the high number of
new records and the connected expansion in knowledge for the
group. In the case of the PNC, it is urgent
to survey the liverworts, which, like mosses, will certainly demonstrate
a considerable taxonomic richness. Also, taxonomic revision studies, species list
or new occurrences reports should be continuous and frequently updated.
In this way, we will be able to pave the
way for new issues and thus contribute to the group's
knowledge and consequently strengthen the preservation of the Atlantic Forest
and its remnants.
