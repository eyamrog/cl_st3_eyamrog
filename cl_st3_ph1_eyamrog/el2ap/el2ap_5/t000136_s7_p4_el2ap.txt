Governance is a complex concept; thus, there are theoretical reasons
to take it as a construct, because as a latent
variable it better represents the theoretical definitions underlying its conceptualization
(Larcker et al., 2007; Harris et al. 2015). Therefore, in
this study governance is a second-order construct that contain a
set of layers of governance dimensions (first order constructs) measured
by governance factors (manifest variables).
