The advance of the agricultural frontier in the north of
Río Negro led to the land on the plateau being
used for dryland livestock production. Livestock practices such as these
result in an ecological imbalance that involves the spontaneous plant
species in the scrublands. In this study, the species that
grow spontaneously in this area were identified, as well as
their specific richness and distribution. The native species were related
to cattle consumption and the exotic species to toxic potential.
The Sörensen similarity index was calculated to express the degree
of similarity between the sites. The study area included 59
families, 197 genera and 300 species of vascular plants. The
most representative families being the Asteraceae, Poaceae, Fabaceae, Solanaceae, Verbenaceae
and Chenopodiaceae. The highest percentage of species consumed were native
and 66% of the exotic species are potentially toxic to
cattle. The Riparian Zone presented a greater number of exotic
species. The highest similarity was between the Plateau Plain and
the Foot of Escarpment. The information provided is a basis
for evaluative studies between dryland cattle production and plant conservation
in the Middle Valley of Río Negro.
