From 2015 to 2018, we carried out interviews with 13
healthcare providers living in the province of CÃ³rdoba and the
Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. They are general practitioners and
gynecologists and obstetricians, clinical doctors, psychologists and social workers. The
study entailed incorporating the report of other professionals, apart from
that presented by medical staff. Public health teams in Argentina
are interdisciplinary; thus, professionals with different specializations may be involved
in some part of the abortion service provision process.
