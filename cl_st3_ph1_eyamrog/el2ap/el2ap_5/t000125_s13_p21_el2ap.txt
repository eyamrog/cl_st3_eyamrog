A more general comparison can be made with a larger
number of European Universities. Considering the top 300 best performers
in Europe in 2020, in terms of average of the
Dimensions, we can see that they have 85.72% of data
available, 10.20% of missing data and 4.08% data that were
considered as “not applicable”. This is of course some kind
of upper limit, since it has the best performers in
Europe, where this ranking was created. So, Brazilian Institutions are
about 40% below the best 300 European Universities.
