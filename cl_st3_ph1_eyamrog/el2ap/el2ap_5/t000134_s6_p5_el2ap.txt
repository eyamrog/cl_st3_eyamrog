With 14 species, Dipsadidae was the most diverse reptilian family
in the PNT, which is consistent with the pattern typically
found for the Squamata in Atlantic Forest remnants in the
state of Rio de Janeiro (e.g., Pontes et al. 2009,
Rocha et al. 2018, Martins et al. 2019). The family
Dipsadidae, which is widely distributed in the Americas and West
Indies (Hedges et al. 2009, Zaher et al. 2009, Grazziotin
et al. 2012), includes the vast majority of the snakes
of the Neotropical region, with more than 700 species (see
Uetz et al. 2019).
