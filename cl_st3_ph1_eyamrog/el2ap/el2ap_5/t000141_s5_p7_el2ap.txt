Besides, the presence of official plan adopted with transparency, widely
disseminated to society, and endowed with clear, well-defined and easily
understood criteria is essential to reduce the influence of groups
and sectors that may interfere with government decisions.(14) Therefore, the
adoption of objective indicators is fundamental for the success of
government strategies and, mainly, for them to be executed fairly
and democratically, based on scientific literature and aiming, above all,
for the benefit of the population.
