As a result of pressure from civil society, a series
of laws, collectively known as the National Education Pillars and
Guidelines Laws (NEPGL), was passed. The first of these, Law
No. 9394/1996, forced the federal education system to universalize primary
and secondary education and signalled the need for higher education
to follow the same path since a far larger number
of young people would be graduating from high school (Federative
Republic of Brazil 2017a). Thus, Law 9394/1996 may be considered
the starting point for all public policies aimed at extending
access to Higher Education in Brazil; it reformed its structure
and organization, opened up the possibility of private higher education
institutions (HEIs), and of continuing education at a distance for
professionals. After the Law 9394/1996 there was a slight increase
in enrollment numbers, going from 1,868,529 that year to 2,694,245
in 2000, almost reaching the projected target for the year
2004. These figures represent an increase of 20.6% in the
period from 1980 to 1994, 28% from 1994 to 1998
and 42,6% from 1994 to 1999. By 2010, the law
had started to show positive results, as the percentage of
the population enrolled in higher education reached 6,379,299, rising to
8,450,755 in 2018 (National Institute of Studies and Educational Research
An√≠sio Teixeira, 2000a; 2000b; 2001; 2012; 2019). However, that legislative
framework was limited by a failure to address factors such
as social vulnerability, geographic access, systemic racial or ethnic exclusion,
socioeconomic status, and poor quality in the provision of public
primary and secondary education.
