The International Health Regulations [World Health Organization (WHO), 2005, p.
9] states that a Public Health Emergency of International Concern
(PHEIC) means an extraordinary event that “(i) constitutes a public
health risk to other countries due to the international spread
of diseases and (ii) potentially requires a coordinated international response.”
Considered the highest level of alertness by the WHO, PHEICs
only occurred before during the H1N1 pandemic (2009), the international
spread of the poliovirus (2014), the Ebola outbreaks (2014 and
2018), and the increase in cases of microcephaly and congenital
malformations caused by the Zika virus (2016) [Pan-American Health Organization
(PAHO) & WHO, 2020].
