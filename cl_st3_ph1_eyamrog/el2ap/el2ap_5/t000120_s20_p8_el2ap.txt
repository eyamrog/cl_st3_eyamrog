Glomus is a dominant genus in areas used for different
purposes, including the Atlantic Forest (Pereira et al. 2014), agroforestry
systems (Bezerra & De Mello 2015), the Amazon (Reyes et
al. 2019) and other Brazilian ecosystems (Da Silva et al.
2014). In this study, we found this genus present in
disturbed areas with soil pH between 4.5 and 4.6, as
pointed out by Borba & De Amorim (2007) when they
reported on Glomus dominance in two disturbed areas. Its high
prevalence in both rainy and dry seasons indicates greater sporulation
capacity and adaptability to soil conditions (Caproni et al. 2003).
