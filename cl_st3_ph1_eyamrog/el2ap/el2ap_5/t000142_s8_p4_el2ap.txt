Figure 1 presents the global scale of femicides. There is
a great difficulty in accessing data on this sensitive matter,
which requires a multidimensional approach. It necessary and of public
interest to store the data and make it available to
scientists. On the other hand, the available data belonging to
the period after 1990 does not include some of the
countries' annual data or some of the data of many
countries at all. According to available data, the number of
women murdered in 2018 in the world is 82,227. Figure
2, which has been created based on the available data,
presents the total global values revealing how the femicides have
been deliberately and systematically committed. The increasing violence, were associated
with the destruction and dissolution resulting from globalization by Friedman
(2003)12. And female movements against the increasing violence have become
global and attracted attention. It is clear that this multifaceted
phenomenon requires multidisciplinary studies. According to the literature review, femicide
has been studied regarding i. feminist, ii. sociological, iii. criminological
iv. human rights and v. decolonial paradigms; however, it is
observed that the investigation of the issue in terms of
the economy has been neglected. However, economic conditions affect the
psychology and behavior of individuals. Therefore, it is important to
investigate femicide from a perspective based on the economy. In
order to prevent future murders, it is vital to determine
the causes of genecide from different perspectives, take the necessary
measures, and put the necessary policies into practice.
