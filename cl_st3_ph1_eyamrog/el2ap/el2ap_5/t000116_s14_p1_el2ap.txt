It is a time-series study conducted in the city of
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The city of Rio de Janeiro
has a history of expanding primary care coverage that has
served as a successful case for the study of primary
care in Brazil and the Americas20. We use data from
the Department of Health, which contains monthly information on the
number of hospitalizations in units of the public health system,
which has universal coverage, for each disease code, between 2008
and 2019, to assess hospitalization trends in three periods of
great importance for primary care in the municipality: the period
between January 2008 and December 2009, which corresponds to the
period before the reorganization of the municipality's primary care, called
Primary Health Care Reform (RCAPS); the period between January 2010
and December 2017, which corresponds to the period of this
reorganization; and the period between January 2018 and December 2019,
which corresponds to the beginning of the changes brought about
by the new National Primary Care Policy (PNAB).
