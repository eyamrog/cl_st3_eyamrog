The Parque Nacional da Tijuca (22º55’–23º00’ S, 43º11’–43º19’ W) is
located in the Tijuca massif in the city of Rio
de Janeiro, capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro,
southeastern Brazil. The park covers a total area of 3,958.38
hectares of dense ombrophilous forest at altitudes between 80 m
and 1,021 m above sea level (a.s.l.). The park is
divided officially into four sectors (ICMBIO 2008): Sector A –
the Tijuca Forest, Sector B – the Carioca Mountains, Sector
C – Pedra Bonita/Pedra da Gávea, and Sector D –
Pretos-Forros/Covanca (Figure 1). The landscape of the park encompasses a
range of land uses and vegetation cover, from forest encompassing
distinct stages of succession, to open fields, rocky outcrops, as
well as infrastructure, such as buildings and roads (Coelho Netto
2005).
