Even though internet access is unevenly available, the use of
mobile phones has grown among socially disadvantaged Brazilians, potentially due
to greater ease of purchase. The NHSS indicated that 96%
of Brazilian households possessed, in 2018, at least one mobile
phone. The ICT Report confirms that most Brazilians have access
to an Internet connection using mobile phones for basic daily
activities but points out “[...] that important limitations persist for
carrying out activities that demand greater connective capacity and data
traffic” (Brazilian Institute of Statistics and Geography 2019, p. 101).
