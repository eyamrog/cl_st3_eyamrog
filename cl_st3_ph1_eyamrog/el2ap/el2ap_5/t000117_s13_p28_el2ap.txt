Such educational proposal intends to gain legitimacy by means of
truths grounded on science, as rendered evident by passages such
as: “a consistent set of scientific ideas, generated mostly outside
Brazil, suggests that one of the factors is the distancing
of children from nature” (p.19); “Some research gives us clues
that children enjoy little contact with nature in such spaces”
(p. 20); “we believe that science grounds the benefits of
the contact with nature in the school environment” (p. 80).
This proposal produces, further, criteria for the distinction between the
normal and abnormal child as it specifies its own designation
for the problems identified. These include the “nature deficit disorder”,
recurring in urban milieus, expressed in symptoms like: “obesity, hyperactivity,
attention deficit, emotional imbalance, low motor coordination – lack of
balance, agility and physical ability – and myopia are a
few of the more evident health problems caused by this
context” (Barros, 2018, p. 16).
