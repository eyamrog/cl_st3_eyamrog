Finally, we checked if the observed changes were significant, considering
the effects of step (change in the level of the
result immediately after the policy) and ramp (change of trend
in the post-political segment) (Table 3). The data confirm that
the most consistent change in the trend occurred between the
baseline and the RCAPS. We found that the total rate
showed a change in the slope, followed by almost all
groups, except the nose, ear and throat infection, lung diseases,
epilepsy, kidney and urinary tract infection, skin infection and female
pelvic inflammatory disease. Also, it is essential to note that
the change to diseases related to childbirth and the puerperium
was an increase in the hospitalization rate, unlike the others,
which was a reduction. For nutritional deficiencies, asthma, angina, urinary
tract infection and gastrointestinal ulcers, the change was immediate, as
seen in the step effect. The change between RCAPS and
PNAB was less impactful, significant only for asthma, hypertension, epilepsy,
and skin infections (level) and angina, epilepsies and diseases related
to childbirth and the puerperium (slope). The verification of the
residues shows that the models were well adjusted (goodness-of-fit and
Durbin-Watson Statistics).
