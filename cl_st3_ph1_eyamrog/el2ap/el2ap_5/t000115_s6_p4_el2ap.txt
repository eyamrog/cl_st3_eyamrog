It is noteworthy in this study that, after mass treatment
of the indigenous population of the village, although there was
no significant reduction in the number of helminth infections, infections
by geo-helminths were no longer detected among the students evaluated.
Considering that the establishment of control through mass administration of
antiparasitic drugs is directed at these pathogens, it could be
said that the measure adopted was effective. 19,20 However, the
highest prevalences of parasitic infections in the indigenous students investigated
was caused by protozoa, which did not decrease after the
drug intervention, with an increase in the number of infections
by E. histolytica/dispar being observed. Other authors have also pointed
out that protozoa like Entamoeba spp. and G. duodenalis were
more common in indigenous children, while A. lumbricoides and hookworms
were more common in adults.20 Intestinal protozoa may be non-pathogenic,
but some species such as E. histolytica, G. duodenalis and
Blastocystis hominis are responsible for cases of diarrhea, malabsorption and
malnutrition.21 These enteroparasites can be transmitted by water, food or
direct contact between people, and can contribute to impaired school
performance and physical development of children.22 The public health problem,
as outlined, is evident.
