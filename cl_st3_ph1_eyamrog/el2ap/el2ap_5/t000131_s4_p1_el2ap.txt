We concluded that M. laevigata showed better performance under 25%
of retention of solar radiation flux, and not under full
sun, contradicting our main hypothesis. We also concluded that plants
of both Mikania species show a low capacity of growing
under shading conditions. However, under shading both species invested more
in shoot biomass, a strategy presumably associate with enhanced growth
to reach the canopy more quickly. Although lianas are known
as light-dependent plants, the two species presented different responses under
the same irradiance conditions. M. laevigata showed better growth under
shading of 25% irradiation interference, while M. glomerata grows better
from 0 to 50% irradiation interference.
