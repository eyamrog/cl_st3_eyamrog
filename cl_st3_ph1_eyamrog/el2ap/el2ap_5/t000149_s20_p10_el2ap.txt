At the specific level, four species of Asteraceae are distributed
in all the sites (Centaurea calcitrapa L., C. soltistialis L.,
Gaillardia megapotamica (Spreng.) Baker and Gamochaeta filaginea (DC.) Cabrera) which
are all frequent in highly disturbed areas; and following, in
descending order, the Poaceae family with three species (Bromus catharticus
Vahl. var. catharticus, Hordeum murinum L. and Nassella tenuis (Phil.)
Barkworth) which are the main forage plants in the area;
two species of Brassicaceae, Eruca vesicaria Mill. and Sysimbrium irio,
both exotic species commonly found on road verges and tracks
along power lines; and four families have only one species
in the four sites: Amsinckia calycina (Moris) Chater (Boraginaceae), Stellaria
media (L.) Cirillo (Caryophyllaceae) (in PP and FE it is
found under shrubs), Euphorbia collina Phil. (Euphorbiaceae) and Plantago patagonica
Jacq. (Plantaginaceae).
