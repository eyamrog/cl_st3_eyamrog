Microorganisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, can adapt
to different environments and be easily spread by humans through
food, and they can also be distributed in the environment,
air, dust, and sewage water. In general, microorganisms are becoming
resistant to the commonly used chemical disinfectants, either by its
use and incorrect destination or by the formation of biofilms
or resistance transfer (DOLAN; COSTERTON, 2002).
