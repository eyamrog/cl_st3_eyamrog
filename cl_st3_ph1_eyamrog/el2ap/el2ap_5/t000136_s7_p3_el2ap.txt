Thus, prior research operationalizes governance using a variety of measures.
For example, Kitching (2009) include one specific indicator of governance;
Yetman and Yetman (2012) include multiple indicators simultaneously; and Harris
et al. (2015) develop governance dimensions measures. While each of
these measurement approaches is appropriate for the given research question
and research design, standard for measuring governance as a latent
variable (a set of governance dimensions measured by governance factors)
remains a research gap. In other words, previous studies built
unidimensional factors and multidimensional constructs for governance dimensions, and evaluated
the impact of these factors and dimensions on donations.
