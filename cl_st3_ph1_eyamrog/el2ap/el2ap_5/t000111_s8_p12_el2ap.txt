Cunha & Cintra (2008) propose something similar: appositive phrases have
nominal nature, are coreferential to the nominal they are related,
and are juxtaposed2. Cunha & Cintra, however, observe that appositive
constructions cannot have adjectival nature, because they constitute a unit
that indicates the same being their related nominal points out
to, but never characterize it (p. 174). In the following
section, I turn to sentential appositives, their constitution and functioning.
