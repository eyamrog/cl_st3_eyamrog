The outcomes of the present study were the rate of
medical procedures, with information available on the Outpatient Information System
(SIA-SUS; http://sia.datasus.gov.br/principal/index.php). The procedures were categorized into three groups: a)
Medical appointments (home appointments /care and medical appointments in Primary
Health Care); b) Prenatal procedures (prenatal appointments of partner, prenatal
appointments, puerperal appointments, fast-testing for HIV detection in the expectant
mother or father/partner, fast-testing of pregnancy, fast-testing for syphilis in
the expectant mother or father/partner), c) Diabetes care (diabetes treatment,
diabetic foot examination, research into glucose in urine). We also
calculated the total number of the abovementioned procedures. Thus, the
absolute number of procedures per 10,000 inhabitants was calculated monthly
(February to December of 2018, 2019 and 2020) for each
group. Estimates of inhabitants in 2019 were based on information
provided by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE;
