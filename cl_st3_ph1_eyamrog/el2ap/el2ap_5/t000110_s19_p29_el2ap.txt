Sellaphora emilia Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot belongs to the group bacillum
of genus Sellaphora (Mann et al. 2008). Differs from Sellaphora
renata Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot in having valves with consistently straight
margins, less broadly rounded ends and by the smaller valve
dimensions (2007: L: 45.0-124.0 µm, W: 12.0-14.0 µm and L:
45.0-140.0 µm, W: 15.0-21.0 µm; respectively). The species was present
in only 2% of the core samples, and reaches 1%
maximum abundance. It is also present in samples corresponding to
the Late Holocene (~1.757 cal. yr BP). Current study is
the first report of the species occurrence in Brazil.
