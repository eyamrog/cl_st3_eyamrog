Morphology and biomass partitioning - There was a significant effect
of the retention of solar radiation flux and species for
leaf area (LA). M. glomerata showed higher LA than M.
laevigata at 90 and 150 DAT (figure 4). At 90
DAT, LA of plants developed under I0 was 50% and
12% higher than plants grew under I75 for M. glomerata
and M. laevigata, respectively (figure 4 a). At 150 DAT,
this difference was between 23% and 27%. In this same
sampling, LA of M. glomerata developed under I0, I25, and
I50 were 1.7-fold higher when compared to M. laevigata plants
(figure 4 b). The SLA decreased with increased levels of
solar radiances (figure 4 c, d). In both species (150
DAT) developed under I75, SLA was on average 1.4-fold higher
when compared to plants grown under I0, I25, and I50
(figure 4 d).
