NPO generally develop their activities through projects (Diallo and Thuillier,
2004). To do so, they raise funds for projects that
will carry out the activities defined by their institutional mission,
by submitting proposals to national and international bodies. According to
the most recent yearbook “Environmental Management Analysis 2013/2014” (Análise Gestão
Editorial, 2015), 97% of the resources of environmental NPO operating
in Brazil were donations from partners, national bodies and international
organizations. Therefore, the volume of other resources (revenues from services
rendered and sale of goods) is minimal.
