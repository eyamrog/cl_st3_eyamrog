In the sample (n = 18), reopening plans, decrees, and
technical notes were identified (Table 1). The states of Amazonas,
Ceará, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Piauí, Rio de Janeiro, and
Sergipe presented health metrics for economic reopening in official reopening
documents. The states of Acre, Pará, Paraíba, Rondônia, Rio Grande
do Sul, and São Paulo presented the indicators for monitoring
the epidemic both in plans for reopening and in decrees
and technical notes. The states of Alagoas, Mato Grosso, Mato
Grosso do Sul, Rio Grande do Norte, and Santa Catarina
formalized monitoring indicators only through decrees and technical notes. The
other states (Amapá, Bahia, Distrito Federal, Goiás, Maranhão, Pernambuco, Paraná,
Roraima, and Tocantins) formulated documents that did not meet the
study's inclusion criteria.
