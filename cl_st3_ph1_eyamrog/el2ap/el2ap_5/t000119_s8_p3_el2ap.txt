Plant propagation in different levels of simulated saline stress has
been studied by several researchers. However, there is a lack
of information in the literature on the assessment of the
effects of salts on common rue seed germination. Common rue
(Ruta graveolens L.) is a plant of the Rutaceae family,
cultivated through seeds and utilized for medicinal purposes due to
the presence of secondary metabolites such as flavonoids, coumarins, organic
acids, terpenoids, lactones and several classes of alkaloids (Ratheesh et
al. 2009). One of the flavonoids present in the leaves,
i.e., rutin has been described with an antioxidant, anticancer and
anti-inflammatory properties (Benazir et al. 2011).
