In this study, the indicators were further distributed into five
major categories, according to the following characteristics: disease's frequency and
distribution; social and collective adherence; capacity installed/assistance profile; productive potential;
and availability of inputs. The groups were presented and described
in Figure 1, designated with geometric symbols. The figure reveals
the territorial distribution of these parameters based on the presence
of health indicators in the normative basis and on the
categories surveyed. A detailed description of each federation unit's indicators
is presented in Supplementary Table 1.
