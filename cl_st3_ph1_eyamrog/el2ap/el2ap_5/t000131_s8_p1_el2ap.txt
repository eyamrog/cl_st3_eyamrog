Lianas are life forms frequently found in tropical and subtropical
forests (Gentry & Dodson 1987) that explore all forest layers
through different mechanisms of ascension, growth patterns, and physiological strategies
(Schnitzer & Bongers 2002, Gerwing 2004, Kazda et al. 2009).
Lianas stems are relatively thin and depends on external support
to access the sunlight. Therefore, lianas species often allocate less
carbon in stem growth, and more carbon in photosynthetic and
vascular tissues (Putz 1984, Schnitzer 2005), leading to an advantage
over trees due to higher growth rates (Zhu & Cao
2009). In addition, the ability to grow both laterally and
vertically allows lianas to easily invade the canopy, extending long
branches and reaching adequate light conditions (Schnitzer & Bongers 2002,
Toledo et al. 2003). Since radiation requirements of lianas are
high, those species are often classified as gap-dependent pioneer species,
presenting a similar distribution pattern of pioneer tree species (Putz
1984, Schnitzer & Bonger 2002). However, some lianas are also
able to germinate and grow in the understory (Nabe-Nielsen 2002,
Sanches & VÃ¡lio 2002, Schnitzer et al. 2012), suggesting some
level of shade tolerance (Gerwing 2004).
