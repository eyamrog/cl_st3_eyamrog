three academic areas we considered, syllabuses in the social sciences
assigned the most journal articles (5,264) on more syllabuses (457;
36.3%), followed by the humanities, with 1,656 journal articles assigned
on 165 syllabuses (23.9%), with than science far behind with
only 1,041 such readings assigned on 86 syllabuses (5.9%) (Table
4). The social sciences also assigned a greater number of
scholarly book chapters, as well as media articles than the
other two areas, in relative and absolute terms. On the
other hand, the humanities syllabuses lead in trade-book chapters, with
570 on 64 syllabuses (9.3%).
