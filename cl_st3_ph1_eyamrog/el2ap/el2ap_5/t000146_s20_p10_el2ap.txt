The non-linearity in the relationship with the representativeness of the
SciELO CI domain seems, to some extent, to be caused
by the countries represented in it (Fig. 2-B), which are
Brazil, USA and Spain. Brazil is the one that has
more journals, and has a relatively significant impact on SciELO
CI, even though it does not publish a proportional percentage
in its own language (as is the case of Colombia,
Cuba and Peru). Obviously, this domain is not significant for
the USA, as already mentioned. In the case of Spain,
the non- representation is caused more by factors related to
production than to the question of its impact. On the
other hand, it should be pointed out that, although SciELO
CI is a widely recognized database that can be employed
in the analysis of the impact of the research output
of the LAC countries on Public and Collective Health. Moreover,
all LAC countries also have some impact within the wider
context of the WoS platform.
