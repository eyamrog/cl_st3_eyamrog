Since hospitalizations are the result of acute illness or worsening
of chronic disease, and the effect can be rapid, we
choose not to use time lag between policy change and
observation of outcomes. We highlight the results with statistical significance
at a level of 5%. Besides, we tested logarithmic trend
terms to assess possible non-linear trends obtained by the Prais
model. With the results, we used the BIC and AIC
aptitude criteria for the choice. Finally, we test the suitability
of each model for residual analysis. To detect the presence
of autocorrelation in the residue lag (forecast errors), we used
the Durbin-Watson statistic. We performed the analyzes in the R
program, version 3.6.1.
