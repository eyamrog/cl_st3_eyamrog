Initially, we performed a visual inspection of the measures and
dispersion measures (Figure 1). We were able to verify six
different behaviors, considering the comparison between the baseline (Period #
1) and the RCAPS period (Period # 2), and between
the RCAPS period (Period # 2) and the PNA period
(Period # #) 3). First, with an initial drop in
average rates and subsequent maintenance of the level, the pattern
of total rates and groups of hypertension, angina, epilepsy, and
female pelvic inflammatory diseases. The second pattern is of groups
in which there is a decline in the two comparisons:
vaccine-preventable diseases, infectious gastroenteritis, bacterial pneumonia, and diabetes. The third
pattern is of groups in which there is an initial
increase, followed by a reduction: nutritional deficiencies, gastrointestinal ulcers and
diseases related to prenatal and puerperium. The fourth pattern is
of groups with initial reduction and posterior increase: asthma and
lung diseases. The fifth pattern is grouped with an increase
in the two comparisons: cerebrovascular diseases, kidney infection and urinary
tract and skin. Finally, the last pattern is that of
groups in which there was no apparent change: anemia, ear,
nose and throat infections and heart failure.
