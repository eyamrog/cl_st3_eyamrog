In the third model, related to the outcome of just
one diagnosis (anxious or depressive symptoms), the youngest (up to
24 years old) showed 1.5 more chances of having one
of the symptomatologies compared to those between 31 and 39
years old (OR = 0.7; 1/OR = 1.4), and two
times more chances compared to those over 39 (OR =
0.5; 1/OR = 2). Regarding income, those who did not
have a steady income showed more chances of having any
of the set of symptoms compared to those who had
a steady income (OR = 1.3), as well as those
who perceived themselves as ill in relation to those who
perceived themselves as healthy (OR = 2.4). Those who scored
above the mean on the meta-worry scale were about 11.5
times more likely to have symptoms suggestive of anxiety or
depression than those who scored up to the mean (OR
= 11.4).
