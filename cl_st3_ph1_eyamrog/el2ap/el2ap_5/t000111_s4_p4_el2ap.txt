The main claim of the discussion presented here is that
the quem-type sentences in question are free relative clauses with
appositive content. If they are really free relatives in the
terms proposed by Medeiros Junior (2014), as I am trying
to argue, the antecedent D head and the relative CP
head have been amalgamated through head incorporation. This means that
the relativized nominal is not the anchor, but something else
(the amalgamated DP); it would then explain the possibility of
eliding the anchor in such constructions.
