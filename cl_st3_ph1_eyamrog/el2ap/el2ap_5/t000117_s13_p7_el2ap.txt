The aim of the educational systems in the twenty-first century
will then be to try and secure the primacy of
knowledge building, in a society where the information flux is
vast and abundant, and in which the role of the
teacher must not still be that of a mere knowledge
conveyor, but one of learning mediator. A learning process that
does not necessarily take place inside schooling institutions, but, instead,
one that reaches beyond the school’s walls, being able to
be carried out into the most diverse informal contexts by
means of connections in the global networks. (Coutinho & Lisbôa,
