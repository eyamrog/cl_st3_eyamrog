Culture techniques for macroalgae in laboratory are valuable tools in
ecophysiological studies for basic research or to obtain relevant products
to humans (Fernandes et al. 2011). According to Berland et
al. (1972) contaminants in macroalgal culture medium grow and proliferate
faster than the algae do, competing for nutrients and releasing
substances capable of inhibiting algal growth. Fernandes et al. (2011)
say that the establishment and maintenance of macroalgal cultures free
of contaminating organisms have been one of the main challenges
found by researchers. Contaminating organisms as cyanobacteria and microalgae, fungi
and heterotrophic bacteria, protozoa and invertebrates can also grow in
these cultures. Commonly, the main contamination source for macroalgal cultures
is the biota on the algal surface.
