Photosynthetic pigment analysis - Photosynthetic pigments were extracted and quantified
following the methodology of Hendry and Price (1993). Leaf discs
(0.1g) were ground in 80% acetone, and the absorbance was
measured at 480, 645, and 663 nm using a spectrophotometer
model Genesys 5Spectronic. Based on the absorbance value, the concentration
of total chlorophyll and carotenoids were calculated.
