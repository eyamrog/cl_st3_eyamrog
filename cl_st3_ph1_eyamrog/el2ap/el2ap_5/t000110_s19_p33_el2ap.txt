In a review of several Sellaphora materials, Mann et al.
(2004) mentioned that Sellaphora ventraloconfusa (Lange-Bertalot) Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot should
be included in the Sellaphora seminulum (Grunow) D.G.Mann group, but
all information available to date is still insufficient to confirm
it. This species was present at only 2% of the
core samples, and reached 1% maximum abundance. It occurred from
samples corresponding to the Late Holocene (~408 cal. yr BP).
Current investigation is the first document of the occurrence of
the species in the Brazilian Amazon.
