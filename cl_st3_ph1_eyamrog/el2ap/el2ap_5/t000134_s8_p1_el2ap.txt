The Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome is one of the world’s
biodiversity hotspots (Myers et al. 2000), although it has now
been reduced to only around 12% of its original cover
as a result of centuries of intense deforestation (Ribeiro et
al. 2011, SOS Mata Atlântica, INPE 2018). Approximately 625 amphibian
species (Haddad et al. 2013, Rossa-Feres et al. 2017) and
300 reptiles (Tozetti et al. 2017) are known to occur
in this biome, and new species are still being steadily
described (e.g., Cruz et al. 2019, Maciel et al. 2019,
Prates et al. 2019). In the state of Rio de
Janeiro, 201 species of amphibian have been recorded, including 197
anurans and four caecilians (Dorigo et al. 2018), together with
149 reptiles (Oliveira et al. 2020). This state has a
high rate of endemism of both amphibians (Dorigo et al.
2018, Rossa-Feres et al. 2017) and reptiles (Tozetti et al.
2017), and its metropolitan region is considered to be an
important area for the conservation of Brazilian biodiversity (Oliveira et
al. 2019).
