Leaf anatomy - Leaf fragments (1 cm²) were fixed in
FAA 70% for 24 hours and dehydrated in ethanol series
(Kraus & Arduin 1997). Then, samples were embedded in paraffin,
cut in a microtome (8 μm), and stained with 1%
toluidine blue. Samples were observed using a microscope QUIMIS (Q720
ED), photographed and the images were used to measure the
leaf thickness, adaxial (AdE) and abaxial epidermis thickness (AbE), and
palisade (PP) and spongy parenchyma (SP) thickness. Measurements were performed
using the software AnatiQuanti 2.0 (Laboratory of Plant Anatomy/UFV). We
found a hypodermic layer below the adaxial epidermis in both
species, but since we did not found this tissue in
all samples, it was not quantified.
