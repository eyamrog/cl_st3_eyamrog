A page rate of $0.021 can be neatly distributed among
authors, publishers and Access Copyright at $0.007 per page for
each of the three parties. This $0.007 per page corresponds
to what authors receive for a typical paperback sale in
a bookstore. It also matches Access Copyright’s 35 percent charge
for “administrative holdback” (Publisher Distribution Guidelines, 2020). It somewhat undercuts
the publishers’ more typical 60/40 split with authors under Access
Copyright, although none of these calculations is above criticism (Geist,
2008).
