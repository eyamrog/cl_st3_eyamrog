This division gave rise to two distinct associations, to lives
lived in parallel. In a large notarial survey, Kubota was
able to identify that marriage rates between Okinawans and Japanese
in Campo Grande have always been minimal, lower than marriage
rates between Okinawans and Brazilian and Japanese and Brazilian. Ethnography
shows a systematic process of non- relationship between Okinawans and
Japanese (Naichi), identified in the refusal to make relatives, to
produce kinship. The cases of marriage between Japanese and Okinawan
are extremely rare. We can see here the kinship as
a certain political expression of colonial relations between Japan and
Okinawa. And this expression in Brazil persisted almost throughout the
twentieth century.
