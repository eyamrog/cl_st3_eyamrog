The data adjustment and analysis procedures were performed using the
SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 23). The final
scores of the instruments were obtained with descriptive analyses (absolute
and percentage frequency, mean, and standard deviation). Four Binomial Logistic
Regression models (Backward LR method) were used to estimate the
effects of the independent variables sex, skin color, education, living
alone, having chronic illness, age (categorized by quartiles in up
to 24 years, 25-30 years, 31-39 years, and over 39
years), income, health perception, and meta-worry (dichotomized by the mean
in above the mean and up to the mean) towards
symptoms of anxiety and depression.
