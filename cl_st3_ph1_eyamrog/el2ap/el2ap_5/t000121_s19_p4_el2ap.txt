In the outcome related to depressive symptoms (second model), younger
people (up to 24 years old) showed more chances of
having symptoms in relation to all age groups of older
people: in relation to those between 25 and 30 years
old, they showed 1.6 more chances (OR = 0.6; 1/OR
= 1.6), in relation to those who were between 31
and 39, they had two times more chances (OR =
0.5; 1/OR = 2), and in relation to those who
were over 39, they had 2.5 times more chances (OR
= .4; 1/OR = 2.5) of presenting depressive symptoms. Those
who perceived themselves as ill were 2.5 times more likely
to have depressive symptoms than those who perceived themselves as
healthy (OR = 2.4). Those who declared living alone were
about 1.5 times more likely to have depressive symptoms than
those who did not live alone (OR = 1.4). Regarding
meta-worries, those who scored above the mean on the scale
showed approximately 6.5 more chances of symptomatology suggestive of depression
than those who scored up to the mean (OR =
6.6).
