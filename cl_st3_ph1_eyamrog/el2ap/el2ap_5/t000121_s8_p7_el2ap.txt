This study aimed to analyze the associations between meta-worry and
symptoms of anxiety and depression in the face of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Data collection was conducted in the initial period
of the recommendation of social isolation and quarantine for suspected
and confirmed cases in Brazil, in March, 2020. To do
so, initially the occurrence of anxious and depressive symptoms was
estimated. Then, the mean of the meta-worry score was calculated.
Finally, we tested a predictive model in which meta-worrying explains
the variability of anxiety and depression symptoms in the population.
