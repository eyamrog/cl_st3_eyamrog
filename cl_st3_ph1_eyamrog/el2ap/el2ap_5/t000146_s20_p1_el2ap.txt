The distribution of the research output of authors from institutions
in the countries that publish most in SciELO CI journals,
is displayed in Table 1. It can be seen that
the publication rate in the national language is at least
80%, for countries which belong to the SciELO Network. The
United States (USA) is the exception, with 73.6%, and it
should be noted that, as well as not having its
own journals in SciELO CI, names from this country appear
as the co-authors of research conducted in Latin America in
most of the articles.
