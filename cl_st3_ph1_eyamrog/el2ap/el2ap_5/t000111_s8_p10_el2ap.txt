In one case or another, both types of appositives are
said to be somehow coordinated to their anchors, this being
attested by many relevant studies (see DÃ¶ring, 2014; Ott, 2014),
though Griffiths (2015) might himself argue, with very convincing empirical
material, that reformulative apposition behaves as a coordinated structure1, while
attributive appositives are elements integrating a finite parenthetical copular clause
with unpronounced material, namely the copula and the relative pronoun.
