Regarding age, we observed that the chance of younger people
presenting symptoms in all outcomes was higher. In all models
evaluated, the group of those who were up to 24
years old was more vulnerable to anxious and / or
depressive symptoms at the time of collection. It is noteworthy
that younger people generally have less experience in relation to
different psychosocial stressors when compared to older people, and some
of these stressors seem to be aggravated in the current
pandemic scenario. As an example, the younger you are, the
more likely you are to be at the beginning of
your professional career and still looking for financial stability, which
increases the probability of not having a steady or regular
income either (Huang & Zhao, 2020; Liu, Zhang, Wong, &
Hyum, 2020), and a steady income was also a variable
present in all outcomes (except in depression, isolatedly). It is
also worth noting the current findings come up in a
scenario of 2 months after the start of the adoption
of quarantine and social distance measures (period of the data
collection); in another words, a situation in which stressors related
to unemployment and income were already feared and shared socially.
