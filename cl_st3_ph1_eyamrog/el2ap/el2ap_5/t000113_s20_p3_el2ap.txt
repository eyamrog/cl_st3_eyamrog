In addition to the trio of giftedness, talent, and Development
Process, the Differentiating Model of Giftedness and Talent (DMGT), has
as its constructs two additional elements called intrapersonal and environmental
catalysts that play the role of facilitators in the process
(Gagné, 2013a). Even though they are theoretically separated, they are
related and interdependent constructs since they are part of a
process that corresponds to the progressive development of the endowment
of talents (GAGNÉ, 2013b). As Gagné (2013a) comments, there are
no pure differentiation measures of both moments as they are
part of a continuum of a broader dynamic process. However,
giftedness is a sine qua non condition of talent. Therefore,
the timely indication, identification, and assistance of these D&T people
in the AEE rooms are vital for their talent development.
