However, many of these D&T students suffer from their invisibility
in Brazilian society. And particularly in the educational sector before
their teachers, educational technicians, educational managers, and even their relatives
and guardians. Data at the national level confirm this invisibility
throughout the Brazilian territory. The Brazilian Association for the Gifted
of Rio Grande do Sul (ABSD-RS) estimates an index of
7.78% of D&T students in Brazil (Negrini, 2008). The School
Census of Basic Education reports the existence of 48,133 of
these D&T students in regular classes (Figure 1) out of
a total of 47.8 million registered enrollments (INEP, 2019). Therefore,
we infer that there are more than two million D&T
students to be identified in Brazil. They suffer from invisibility
and, therefore, are not considered for the AEE of schools.
