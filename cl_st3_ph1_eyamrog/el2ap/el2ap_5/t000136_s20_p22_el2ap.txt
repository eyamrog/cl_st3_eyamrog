The development of the governance construct was a contribution to
the agency theory approach, regarding relationships in the third sector.
Yetman and Yetman (2012) developed measures for governance. However, many
referred to factors (indicators) related to specific dimensions of governance,
in particular the Board (for example Harrison and Murray, 2015),
Disclosure (for example Blouin et al., 2018), and Accountability (for
example Tacon et al., 2017), and analyzed the effect of
the indicators (not the construct) on some measure of donation
(for example Hasnan et al., 2016). Few studies have analyzed
a broader set of indicators for the governance construct (for
example Blouin et al., 2018), and even less addressed the
impact of the constructs on donations measure (for example Harris
et al., 2015). The basic assumption of the agency theory
is the existence of an agency problem arising from the
contractual relationship between principal and agent (Jensen and Meckling, 1976).
From this perspective, governance is a set of internal and
external mechanisms aimed at mitigating the agency problem (Jensen, 1993).
