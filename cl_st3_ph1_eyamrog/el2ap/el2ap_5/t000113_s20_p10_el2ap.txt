Family experiences reinforce these legitimizing myths in the early stages
of the child's development. It shapes how the individual relates
in his adulthood to other people - the individual's images
of people and events are represented by objects in the
unconscious. In this sense, these legitimizing myths create barriers to
the development of female social figures, creating myths and perceptions
â€“ such as the example mentioned earlier in the interview:
the constant recognition of the gifted male figure to the
detriment of the female figure as shown in Table 01.
