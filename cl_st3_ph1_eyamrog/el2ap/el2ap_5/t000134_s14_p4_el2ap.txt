We calculated rarefaction curves and confidence intervals (95%) with the
moment-based estimator of species richness (Colwell et al. 2004) to
verify the efficiency of the sampling effort in terms of
the number of species recorded during the study for both
amphibians and reptiles. For this analysis, one hour of VES
constituted a sampling unit, with a total of 460 samples
being obtained during the study period as a whole. We
considered the convergence of the confidence intervals to zero as
an indicator of sampling sufficiency (Colwell et al. 2004). We
also estimated the number of species and standard deviation with
the Bootstrap richness estimator (Smith & van Belle 1984) with
1,000 runs. Both the rarefaction curves and Bootstrap were calculated
in the program EstimateS 8.2.0 (Colwell 2009). We analyzed the
distribution of the species abundance, using rank abundance curves or
Whittaker plots (Whittaker 1965), which show the ranked log abundance
of each species (Krebs 1999). We analyzed these plots in
PAST 2.17 (Hammer et al. 2001).
