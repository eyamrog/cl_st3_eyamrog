This is a questionable form to make a general classification,
because it does not look at the whole performances in
all Indicators. Besides that, there is also the problem of
giving different weights for each Dimension, because Dimensions with more
Indicators will dominate the global evaluation. A good example for
debate is the second and third place of this list.
Using the criterions defined by “U- Multirank”, Federal University of
São Carlos is in second place, with 3 A, 2
B and 6 D grades. University of São Paulo is
in third place, with 3 A, 1 B, 3 C
and 5 D. If we make a “table points”, assuming
a correspondence like A = 5, B = 4, C
= 3, D = 2 and E = 1, University
of São Carlos would have 35 points in total, while
University of São Paulo would have 38 points, a better
general performances. Therefore, the order of positions in the ranking
would be inverted and University of São Paulo would be
in the second place. Of course there is potential for
much more problems of this type.
