The treatment of geo-helminthiasis in children in the school environment
is an effective way for controlling these parasites, since geo-helminths
do not multiply in the human host and the administration
of broad-spectrum drugs reduces both the prevalence of the disease,
as the intensity of infection in the individual or in
the locality where they live.11 When selecting areas for intervention,
priority should be given to locations with a high prevalence
of geo-helminth infections, as well as those with poor basic
sanitation conditions, such as water supply and sewage collection and
treatment. 12
