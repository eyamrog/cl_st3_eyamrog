50 judges belonging to the traditional rural communities of Mossoró/RN
were randomly chosen to perform the acceptability test on the
action of L. ferrea-based disinfectant at the concentration of 100
mg/mL, which was noticed in the in vitro test (PAGANI
et al., 2015). A hedonic scale adapted from Pagani et
al. (2015) and Beserra et al. (2003) was applied to
evaluate the two surfaces: one with the commonly used disinfectant
and the other with the disinfectant made of jucá leaves.
Each judge received a file including the sensorial evaluation, with
a nine-point structure, from “extremely liked” to “extremely disliked”, to
each evaluated attribute (aroma, color, texture, and surface aspect).
