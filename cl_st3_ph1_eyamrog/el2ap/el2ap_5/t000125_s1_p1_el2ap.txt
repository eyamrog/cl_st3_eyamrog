The present paper makes an evaluation of the performances of
the Brazilian Universities in the “U-Multirank”, in the range from
2017 to 2020. The “U-Multirank” is a multidimensional academic ranking
created in Europe, presenting results since 2014. It gives a
new multidimensional approach that has the goal of showing the
weakness and strengths of each University, using five Dimensions. In
this way, it does not classify Institutions in a single
ranking. This model is very important in Brazil nowadays, because
it is the model that Capes is using to prepare
the new evaluation of the post-graduate system in Brazil. Of
course there will be adaptations, but a general study of
this ranking is important to give an idea of its
future use. Only 20 Brazilian Universities are listed in this
ranking in 2020. It is a small number, but it
is significant in regional terms, since South America has only
35 Universities listed.
