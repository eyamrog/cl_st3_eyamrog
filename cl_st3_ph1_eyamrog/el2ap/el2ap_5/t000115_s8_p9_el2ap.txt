In this study, due to the lack of data regarding
parasitological health indicators in the Guarani indigenous people and the
effectiveness of parasitic treatment in this group, we aimed to
evaluate the frequency of intestinal parasitosis in school-aged children in
a Guarani indigenous village in the State of Paran√°, before
and after treatment with antiparasitic medication adopted as the only
action to control these diseases.
