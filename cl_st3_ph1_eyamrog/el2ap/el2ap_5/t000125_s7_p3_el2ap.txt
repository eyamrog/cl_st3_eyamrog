The first ranking to appear was the “Academic Ranking of
World Universities (ARWU) (http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2020.html), also known as “Shanghai Ranking”, which
was created in 2003 (CALDERÓN; FRANÇA, 2018b). It was made
to support the Chinese government in selecting Universities to send
Chinese students abroad and to compare the level of the
top Chinese Universities with the best Universities in the world.
