In the second examination, carried out 30 days after the
second dose of the antiparasitic agent, 32 samples of fecal
material were collected; 87.5% (28/32) of them were positive for
enteroparasites and 53.13% (17/28) indicated polyparasitism. The frequencies of protozoa
and helminths found in the samples were 84.4% (27/32) and
37.5% (12/32), respectively (Table 1). There was no significant difference
between the frequencies of enteroparasites (total, specific and polyparasitism) between
the two coproparasitological examinations. The only exception was for the
frequency of Entamoeba histolytica/E. dispar cysts, which was higher after
treatment (p= 0.0039). Although there was no significant difference in
the frequency between the two examinations, geo-helminth eggs such as
hookworms, Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura, were only detected before
the treatment of the population.
