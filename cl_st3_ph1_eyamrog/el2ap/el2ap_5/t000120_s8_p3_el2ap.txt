The topmost layer of the forest soil, called serapillera or
forest blanket, is a complex system formed by residues of
plants and animals at various degrees of decomposition, as well
as living microorganisms (De Souza et al. 2016). The use
of biological methods such as nucleation in the restoration of
areas is an economical and efficient way to promote restoration
or even recovery of these areas (Almeida 2016). The increase
in serapillera favors the cycling of nutrients, the improvement of
soil fertility (Primo et al. 2018), and can contribute to
the inoculation of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) that interact with
plants and increase the efficiency in nutrient absorption by the
root system (Almeida 2016, House & Bever 2018). Mycorrhizae can
be severely influenced by damage to vegetation and soil caused
by natural processes or human intervention (Brundrett et al. 1985,
House & Bever 2018). The complete removal of vegetation cover,
the loss of the arable layer and intense soil overturning
are agricultural practices harmful to mycorrhizae (De Souza et al.
2017). To understand the response of secondary forests to disturbances
throughout the successional process, especially those that influence the dynamics
of the serapillera, a better understanding of the relationships between
shrub mycorrhizae and the change in vegetation cover is needed
(Maia et al. 2015).
