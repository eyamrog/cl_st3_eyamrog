In an unstable world, in which the future no longer
seems as the predictable result of a linear and continuous
evolution, but one that has become unpredictable, in a world
where no longer there is any certainty of what will
be the relevant contents and competences as children conclude basic
education, one seeks to develop in the child the dispositions
to acquire the aptitudes that will prove to be necessary.
It no longer seems certain that schools are adequate institutions
to promote the development of the citizen of the future,
as they are configured today.
