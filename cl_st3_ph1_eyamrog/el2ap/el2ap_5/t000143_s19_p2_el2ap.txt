There was not a random distribution of this rate with
positive spatial autocorrelation (I=0,0993881; p-valor = 0,001 for 999 permutations).
It is possible to observe the occurrence of spatial autocorrelations
of the "high-high" type, indicating a grouping of municipalities in
Sergipe with the highest mortality rates due to feminicide located
in the central region of Sergipe (Areia Branca, Malhador, Santa
Rosa de Lima, Ribeirópolis) and the "low-low" type, considered the
group with the lowest rate, represented by the municipalities of
Nossa Senhora de Lourdes, Propriá, São Francisco and Japaratuba (Fig.
2). It was also observed the occurrence of spatial autocorrelations
of the "low-high" type, in the municipality of Maruim, meaning
that the municipality or the spatial group presents low values
regarding the rates of femicide, but high rates in the
surrounding municipalities (Fig. 2). An inverse condition was observed in
the municipalities of Lagarto, Aquidabã and Carmópolis, where spatial autocorrelations
of the “high-low” type occurred, a scenario in which these
municipalities present high rates of femicide, but their surrounding municipalities
have low rates (Fig. 2).
