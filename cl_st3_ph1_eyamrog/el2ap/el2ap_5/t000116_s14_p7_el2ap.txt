We assume that, due to the different nature of the
causes included in the list, some could have an immediate
impact due to changes in primary care policy, and others
a gradual change. In this way, we tested two effects
between trends: we tested differences in the slope of hospitalizations
from an interrupted time series analysis of two groups (ramp
effect). We also evaluated the change in the level of
trends between groups (step effect).
