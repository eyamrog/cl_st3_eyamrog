The high potassium content indicates the presence of primary minerals
and little weathering, which is common for soils in drier
regions (Sobral et al. 2015). Amongst micronutrients, zinc in particular
is absorbed by arbuscular mycorrhizae (De Novais et al. 2017),
which may have accounted for the reduction in its content
between samples. Manganese content was considered high (Sobral et al.
2015), but decreased in the dry season (July), which was
also observed in a study conducted by Bezerra (2017). Aluminum
content also decreased in the dry season, while still maintaining
levels that did not affect sporulation. Cardoso & Kuyper (2006)
reported the increased uptake of these same elements by plant-associated
AMF, leading to a decrease in their content in the
soil and even to a reduction in soil toxicity for
the plants. Finally, results concerning the integrated soil samples from
the experimental unit are consistent with the presence of AMF
throughout the research.
