Ever since Brazil emerged from its colonial status in the
nineteenth century, its education system has been characterized by strict
social stratification and elitism. Exclusion and unequal access are supported
by discourses that function to segregate and maintain existing power
structures. For example, in a 2019 interview former Brazilian Minister
of Education Ricardo Vélez Rodríguez rejected the idea of university
for all, stating that access to university should be a
'privilege' of a small elite (Gazeta do Povo 2019). Moreover,
recent laws such as Ordinance No. 1122/2020 of the Ministry
of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications (MCTIC) determines that technology
and scientific innovation should be given priority in the allocation
of public research funding to HEIs in the four-year period
2020–2023 to the detriment of other areas such as the
humanities and social sciences (Federative Republic of Brazil 2020b). This
document reflects the government’s perception that all but STEM research
is superfluous.
