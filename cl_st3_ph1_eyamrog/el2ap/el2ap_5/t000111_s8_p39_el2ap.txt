Embedded interrogatives ((32)b), however, seem to be slightly different; though
they are understood to be derived via wh-movement all the
same, Italian data, according to Rizzi (1997) and Rizzi &
Bocci (2017), provide evidence to propose that the displaced wh-element
doesnâ€™t seem to be focalized, because one might not find
the same restrictions observed in matrix within an embedded context;
in subordinate clauses, wh-operators are said to occupy the Spec
position of an EmbQ projection.
