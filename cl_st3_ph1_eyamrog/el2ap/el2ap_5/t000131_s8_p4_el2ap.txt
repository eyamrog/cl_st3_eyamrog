Therefore, our objective was to evaluate the morpho-physiological performance of
two Mikania species (Mikania glomerata and Mikania laevigata) under four
different levels of retention of solar radiation flux: full sun
(I0), and 25 (I25), 50 (I50), and 75% (I75). Our
main hypothesis is that both Mikania species will be benefited
from high radiation levels, resulting in enhanced photosynthesis and biomass
production.
