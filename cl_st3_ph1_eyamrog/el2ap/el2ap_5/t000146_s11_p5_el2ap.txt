This was emphasized again in the Helsinki Initiative on Multilingualism
in Scholarly Communication[27]. Furthermore, bibliometrics is not neutral[28], because the
indicators chosen also define the real circumstances in which the
research is carried out. As far as the internationalization of
research is concerned, English is often used as a means
of communication. This has also been reflected in the internationalizing
strategies adopted by several countries in the world[29], as well
as by universities[30]. One of its objectives is to attract
international skills and talent [29], while the international level of
research also makes it an attractive profession for some students[26].
It is argued that the universities of the future will
be international[29], and funding programmes have been launched to support
these institutions, such as the African University of Science and
Technology and the so-called European Universities[31].
