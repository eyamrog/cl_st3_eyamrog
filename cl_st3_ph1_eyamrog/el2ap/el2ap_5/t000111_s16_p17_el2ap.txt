All things set, one might conclude the wh-sentence in (47)
is a free relative clause bearing appositive content, instead of
an ordinary appositive (headed) relative clause. Do we mean by
this that the wh-sentence in (47) is derived from a
headed appositive relative clause? It does not seem to be
the case.
