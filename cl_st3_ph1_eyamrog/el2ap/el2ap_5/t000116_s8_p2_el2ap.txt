Despite the publication of the policy, Rio de Janeiro (second
largest Brazilian city) did not adopt it globally at first,
but in clusters of extreme poverty and assistance voids. By
2009, only 7% of the population had access to FHS
services7. The Primary Health Care Reform (RCAPS) of Rio de
Janeiro, initiated in 2009, was a response by the city
government for this gap8,9. From late 2009 to 2016, robust
investment in PHC led to expansion of services and increase
in population coverage to 60% of the population10. However, in
2017, Brazilian Ministry of Health released a new version of
the National PHC Policy, bringing a lot of conceptual and
operational changes, most of them seen as detrimental for sustainability
of the FHS11,12.
