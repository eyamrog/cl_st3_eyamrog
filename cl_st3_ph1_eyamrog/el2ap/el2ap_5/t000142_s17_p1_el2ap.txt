In order to investigate the existence of the relationship between
the foreign exchange rate and femicide n Turkey, the daily
femicide data belonging to the period between 01 January 2019
and 29 September 2020 were obtained from the We Will
Stop Femicide Platform, and the data regarding the daily buying
rates of US Dollar in the same period were obtained
from the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBTR)
Electronic Data Delivery System (EDDS) (Table 1). These data were
examined through various analyses. The analyses consisted of 373 observations.
Figures 3 and 4 present the distribution of variables over
the period of analysis. While an increase was observed in
the foreign exchange rate during this process, a systematic "gendercide"
was also prominent.
