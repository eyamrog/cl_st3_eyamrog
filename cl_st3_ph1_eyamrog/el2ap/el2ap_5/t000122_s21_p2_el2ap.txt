Immersion treatments in 5% liquid detergent for 60 seconds and
after in 0.2% sodium hypochlorite for 2 and 5 minutes
were effectiveness to eliminate ciliates, microcrustaceans, nematodes and small gastropods,
reducing significantly the number of annelids (table 1). The treatment
5 (thalli immersion in 5% liquid detergent and after in
0.2% sodium hypochlorite for 1 minute) had the lowest effectiveness
in the elimination of contaminants. Small gastropods were eliminated in
all treatments with 0.2% sodium hypochlorite (table 1).
