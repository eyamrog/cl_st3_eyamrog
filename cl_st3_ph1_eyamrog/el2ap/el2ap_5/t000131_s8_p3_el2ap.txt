Mikania glomerata Spreng. and Mikania laevigata Sch. Bip ex Baker
are lianas species both native from Atlantic Forest in Brazil
(Gasparetto et al. 2010). Mikania species belong to the Asteraceae
family and are popularly known as "Guaco" and they both
can benefit from Atlantic forest fragmentation. Within biodiversity hotspots around
the world, the Atlantic forest is considered the most vulnerable
ecosystem to deforestation and climate-change (Béllard et al. 2014). With
a wide range of forest physiognomies (Myers et al. 2000,
Ricketts et al. 2005, Metzger 2009), currently, only 28% of
its original area remains (Rezende et al. 2018). Both species
are similar regarding its morphology and are often indiscriminately used
in traditional medicine to treat colds, flu, asthma, and, bronchitis
because of the bronchodilator and expectorant properties (Moura et al.
2002, Graça et al. 2007, Bolina et al. 2009, Gaspareto
et al. 2010). Recent studies demonstrated that M. glomerata and
M. laevigata have a different chemical composition and therapeutic properties
(Melo & Sawaya 2015, Almeida et al. 2016, Costa et
al. 2017). However, no reports of photosynthetic proprieties and gas
exchange behavior under different light conditions between both species are
found in the literature.
