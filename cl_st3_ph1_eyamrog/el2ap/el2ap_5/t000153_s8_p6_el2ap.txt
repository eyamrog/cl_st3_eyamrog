The Penal Code of Argentina has been in place since
1921 and it establishes that abortion is non- punishable if
performed to avoid risks to the life or health of
a woman or if the pregnancy is the result of
rape. However, for decades, the service has not been offered
as an option by the healthcare system, resulting in the
practice being equated with a total-ban model (Bergallo y Michel
2009). Even when the causal model would allow to include
a great number of abortions currently performed clandestinely1, women and
girls are frequently put under pressure and their privacy inside
public healthcare institutions is violated, when they actually resort to
them seeking a non-punishable abortion. Given this context, in the
last few years, action strategies have been devised with a
view to establishing joint-work relationships among women’s movement activists and
healthcare professionals working in public institutions. One of the most
successful ones has given way to what is today known
as the “Red de profesionales de la salud por el
derecho a decidir” (Network of Healthcare Professionals for the Right
to Decide, henceforth, the Network), with respect to which the
results of research work are here presented.
