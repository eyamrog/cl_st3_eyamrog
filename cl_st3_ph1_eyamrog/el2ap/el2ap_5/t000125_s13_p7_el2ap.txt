The next step of the current research is to make
an individual study of the performances of the 20 Brazilian
Universities listed in the 2020 version of the ranking, using
the graphical classical form shown in Fig. 1. The goal
is to have a first view regarding the Brazilian performances
in 2020, to later complete the study for the period
2017-2020. This is a sequence of the research made by
Morandin et al. (2020), which compared to results obtained in
the “U-Multirank” with the results given by the Ranking Universitário
Folha, in 2020. Figure 2 shows the results of those
Universities.
