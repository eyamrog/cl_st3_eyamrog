Statistical analyses - The number of contaminants (individuals mL-1) in
thalli culture medium immersed in 5% liquid detergent and 1%
povidone iodine at different times was compared to the control
by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), whereas the number
of contaminants in thalli culture medium immersed in 5% liquid
detergent and 0.2% sodium hypochlorite (at different times) was compared
to the control by the following tests: Mann-Whitney (for mean
