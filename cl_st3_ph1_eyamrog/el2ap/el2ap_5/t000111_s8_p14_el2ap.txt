Concerning the data above, one must understand the structure of
each kind of appositive as relating to different derivational processes.
Examples in (b) are appositive relative clauses, whose derivation is
said to include a head raising operation (see Kayne,1994), while
for (10) and (11)a there seems not to be any
relativization process involved. Hence, for (10)b and (11)b, the derivation
goes as follows:
