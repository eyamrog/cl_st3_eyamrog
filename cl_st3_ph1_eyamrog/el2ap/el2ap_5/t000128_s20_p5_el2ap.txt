The results indicate that the hydroalcoholic extract presented a more
efficient effect than that presented by the decoction, since the
absorbance values were lower after 24 hours and it has
inhibited the development and growth of microorganisms as P. aeruginosas
and Salmonella Typhimurium. When comparing the results between the microorganisms,
it may be observed a lower bacterial charge between themselves,
presenting a statistical difference.
