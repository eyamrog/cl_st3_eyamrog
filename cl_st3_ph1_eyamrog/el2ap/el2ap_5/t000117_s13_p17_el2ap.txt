It is notorious that the subject’s formation does not take
place in a specific location such as the school, but
in all the ambiances linked to the dimensions of human
life, i.e., in the family and in other contexts of
civil society. In this sense, the LDBEN’s article is articulated
with conceptions from both reports, Faure’s (1973) and Delors’ (1998),
as both enunciate the displacement of the school space of
learning into all dimensions of life. “Instead of delegating powers
to a single structure, vertically hierarchised and constituting a distinct
body within society, all groups, associations, trade unions, local collectivities
and intermediate bodies should all take up their share of
educational responsibility [...]” (Faure et al., 1973, p. 243).
