Conclusion: The extent of the exposure of a publication language
varies in accordance with the countryÂ´s scientific output. In the
case of Brazilian and US-American publications, the effects on audiences
in other languages can be measured by the citation impact.
Furthermore, the degree of exposure offered by SciELO CI makes
it useful for evaluation, particularly for publications in the national
language.
