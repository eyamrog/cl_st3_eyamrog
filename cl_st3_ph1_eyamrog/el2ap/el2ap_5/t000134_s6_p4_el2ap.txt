Hylidae (N = 10) was the most diverse amphibian family
in the PNT, followed by Brachycephalidae and Cycloramphidae, with five
species. A similar predominance of hylids in the amphibian assemblage
has been recorded not only at other Atlantic Forest sites
(e.g., Heyer et al. 1990, Almeida-Gomes et al. 2014a, Silva
et al. 2017), but also at other localities in the
Neotropical region (e.g., Toft & Duellman 1979, Duellman 1988, Menin
et al. 2017). The high diversity of hylids in South
America has been explained by the fact that this region
is considered to be the center of origin and diversification
of this clade (Wiens et al. 2006).
