Distinguishing how different plant species react to excess salt exposure
is critical as it allows delineating possible salinity control strategies
in arid and semi-arid regions, which are constantly more affected
by soil salinization processes (Oliveira & Silva 2019). Therefore, this
study aimed to evaluate the germination and initial development of
common rue subjected to different saline concentrations.
