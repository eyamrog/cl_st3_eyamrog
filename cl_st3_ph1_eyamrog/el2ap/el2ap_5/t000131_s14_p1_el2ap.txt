Plant material and growth conditions - Experiments were carried out
at the University of São Paulo at Ribeirão Preto campus
(21° 10 '08.4'' 102 S and 47° 51' 50.6'' W),
São Paulo, Brazil, which climate is tropical wet and dry
(Aw) according to the Köppen-Geiger classification. For further details of
climatic conditions during the experiment, see supplementary material table S1.
We used the species Mikania glomerata Spreng. and Mikania laevigata
Sch. Bip ex Baker. Mikania plantlets from each species were
prepared cuttings from the middle of the branches of different
parental plants of approximately 1 cm in diameter, 12 cm
in length, a node at the top of the stake,
and a pair of leaves (Lima et al. 2003). The
plantlets were planted in 3-kg plastic bags containing a mixture
of manure and soil (soil type redlatosol, 1:1) under greenhouse
conditions. After rooting (approximately 60 days), the plants were transferred
into 20 L pots containing soil and submitted to treatments
for 150 days. The soil was fertilized with 1 g
NPK (4-14-8) fertilizer per kg of soil. Plants were subjected
to four light conditions: full sun condition (I0), and 25%
(I25), 50% (I50), and 75% (I75) retention of solar radiation
flux (supplementary figure 1). To achieve the planned levels of
solar radiation, special greenhouses were constructed with artificial shading of
varying degrees of retention of solar radiation flux. During the
experiment, pots were irrigated daily and were maintained at soil
field capacity, using a sensor ML2× Theta Probe (Delta-T Devices,
Cambridge, UK).
