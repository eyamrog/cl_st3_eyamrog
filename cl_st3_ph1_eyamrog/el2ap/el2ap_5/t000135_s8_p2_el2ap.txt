The Unified Health System in Brazil (SUS) covers almost 75%
of the Brazilian population in the country, while the supplementary
health care system caters to the remaining 25%. In the
context of the pandemic, the System is expected to be
equipped to provide assistance to the growing number of cases
of COVID-19 while still attending to other acute and chronic
conditions 7. Unfortunately, deficiencies in Brazilâ€™s healthcare networks, which are
still fragmented and inadequate, the lack of coordination between health
care hierarchies as well as underfunding, have become even more
evident during the pandemic 7, 8.
