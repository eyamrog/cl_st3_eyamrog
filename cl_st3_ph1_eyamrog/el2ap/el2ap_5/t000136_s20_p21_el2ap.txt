We operationalized the variable Donations, the main beneficiary of the
research results, through the amount of donations with donor restrictions,
reported in the Financial Statements. In addition, the single item
construct ‘NPO Certification’ had as proxy the public certifications provided
to NPO in Brazil as OS (Social Organizations), OSCIP, or
a certificate of CEBAS (Charitable Organization for Social Assistance). We
expected that such certifications, some of them related to governance
mechanisms (statutory provision of independent audit, or requirement of superior
deliberation body), as they increase the list of obligations, would
positively moderate the relationship between Governance and Donations. We assumed
that public certifications provided to NPO would be similar to
quality standards (for example, ISO). Companies traditionally seek certification in
order to gain competitive advantage (Rao, 1994), and many NPO
are adopting such practices as a means to improve their
competitive position in the donations market (Slatten, 2011).
