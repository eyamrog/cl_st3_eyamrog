Due to the size of the differences in populations age
profiles, it is not surprising that the values of these
adjusted rates and, even more, the ranking that results from
them differ greatly from the values of crude mortality rates
and their respective ordering. Ranked by the adjusted rate, the
seven countries with the highest mortality all belong to the
group of Western developing countries, comprised of six Latin American
countries and South Africa. Developed countries, such as England, the
USA and Italy, which are at the top of the
ranking of crude mortality rates, all rank below those seven
countries. However, the internal organization of the group of countries
at this stage of development does not undergo significant changes,
which is explained by the similarity of the age profiles
of their populations. Finally, it should be noted that the
final positions of both rankings are occupied by those poorer
Asian countries that, as already highlighted, have a much lower
Covid-19 mortality rate than the Western countries covered in this
study.
