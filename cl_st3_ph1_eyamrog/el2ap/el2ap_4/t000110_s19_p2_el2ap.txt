The species differs from Aulacoseira canadensis (Hustedt) Simonsen (1979: 57)
in the shape of the ringleist that is very solid
and thick at the middle of the column. Another difference
is in the areolae outline that is small and rounded
in Aulacoseira crassipunctata Krammer (Bahls et al. 2009). It was
present in only 2% of the core samples, and had
a maximum abundance of 6%. The species is present in
samples from the Late Holocene, ~2.200 cal. yr BP to
~320 cal. yr BP. This is the first record of
the species occurrence in Brazil.
