There are different modes used in multimodal texts, such as
the picturebook under analysis in this article. Each mode does
something different because each one consists of sets of semiotic
resources. There are different studies that have developed the definition
of mode, such as those of Elleström (2010) and Bateman
(2011). Generally, mode is understood as a “socially shaped and
culturally given resource for meaning making” (Kress, 2010, p. 54).
This involves context and culture determining the different modes used
in a communicative situation.
