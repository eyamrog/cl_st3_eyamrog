Figure 5 shows the comparison between the number of ICU
beds occupied by COVID-19 positive patients, obtained from Entre Ríos
province Critical Units Monitoring Program (Programa de Monitoreo de Unidades
Críticas, PMUC), during the period under study, and the estimate
obtained by the model. This information is extremely important in
order to anticipate a possible local health care system strain.
In addition, this data set that can be obtained from
reality quite accurately. This figure confirms that weekly reports of
ICU beds occupancy with COVID-19 patients are compatible with the
model output values.
