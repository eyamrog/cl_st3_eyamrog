After the event, positive and negative results from each participant
were determined with different commercial COVID-19 test kits at private
laboratories (PCR or rapid antigen). Given that there were some
individuals that only took a rapid antigen test and its
sensitivity is lower than the PCR “gold standard” tests, they
were included in the COVID-19 positive cohort if they reported
more than 3 symptoms including anosmia, even if the rapid
antigen test was falsely negative and no PCR test was
performed (Pilarowski et al., 2021). The symptoms of each group
were described using categorical data by frequency and percentage, and
compared with 𝝌2 among the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups.
