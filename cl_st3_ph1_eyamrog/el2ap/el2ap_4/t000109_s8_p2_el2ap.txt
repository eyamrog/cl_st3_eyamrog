According to current epidemiological reports, this pandemic has characteristics rarely
seen for other infectious diseases [6]. Some of the particularities
of COVID-19 are: its high basic reproduction number (R0) of
up to 2.79 [7]; an asymptomatic infectious period of up
to 14 days, in which there is a group of
individuals with no symptom onsets and the disease can be
detected only through a serological test; and a great variability
in time and clinical repercussions [8]. It has been proven
that the dynamics of this epidemic varies mainly according to
the climate [9], social and health local habits [10] [11],
comorbidities [12] and age range [13], among other variables. The
multiplicity of factors influencing this pandemic requires a different approach,
as it is necessary to focus on the formulation of
more complex and realistic computational models, which include specific characteristics
for each area under study, rather than on conventional models,
mainly mathematical ones. Thus, this paper proposes a novel model
that incorporates local aspects, such as social, cultural, geographical and
climatological variables, linked to the epidemic under study and to
its transmission modes.
