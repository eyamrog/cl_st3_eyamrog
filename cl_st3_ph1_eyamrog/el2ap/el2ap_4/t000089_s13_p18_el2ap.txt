My argument here is that the pragmatist critique of objective
knowledge supports a tradition-oriented approach to RE, whereby practical knowledge
can be enhanced through a syllabus that reflects and accommodates
local cultural activities and pupils’ experiences of religious phenomena. My
own view is that since those practices come to form
a network of cooperative enterprises, Dewey’s thinking opens up possibilities
for a common pursuit of conceptions of good life, which
are informed by cultural perceptions. Although I shall distance myself
from the non-metaphysical assumptions of pragmatist theories in the next
session, Dewey’s and Rorty’s emphasis on culture as the foundation
for any endeavour of moral and intellectual enquiry converges with
my ethical-dialogical framework of RE.
