It is not because we fail to recognize that other
variables, such as gender and prevalence of comorbidities, also affect
crude mortality rates, that this article prioritizes the age profile

data that discriminate deaths according to those other criteria are
even more difficult to obtain. Moreover, none of them has
as crucial and decisive an impact as age on the
risk of death.
