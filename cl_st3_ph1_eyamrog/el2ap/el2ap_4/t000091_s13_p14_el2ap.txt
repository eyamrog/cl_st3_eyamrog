In clinical trials they demonstrated the sedative and hypnotic effect
of valerian at a dosage of 400 to 900 mg
administered 30 to 60 minutes before bed. Furthermore, unlike benzodiazepines,
valerian extracts did not interfere with voluntary movement and speech
coordination and did not lead to physical and / or
psychological dependence (Pakseresht et al., 2011).
