Objective: To compare the proportion of deaths among hospitalized cases
of COVID- 19 in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro,
stratified by private and public services. Methods: Hospitalization data for
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was obtained by the SIVEP-Gripe
Database. All hospitalized adults who were diagnosed as COVID-19 or
unspecified SARS, between January and December 2020, were included in
the analysis. Logistic regression models were fitted to evaluate the
risk of death between Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo,
adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidities. Results: A total of
388,657 hospital registers for Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo
(91,532 and 297,125, respectively) were analyzed. Missing data is frequent
in the database and it was greater in Rio de
Janeiro, at the state and capital levels. Adjusting for confounders,
the odds ratio of dying by Covid-19, comparing the state
of Rio de Janeiro with São Paulo, was 2.51 in
the private hospitals and 2.29 in the public ones. For
the capitals, the scenario is worse. The lethality among hospitalized
patients with COVID-19 in Rio de Janeiro is at least
twice compared to São Paulo, both at the states and
capitals. The public or private services showed important differences, with
odds ratios of 2.74 and 3.46, respectively.
