In the study conducted by Farah et al (2019), 20
anxious patients with indication for bilateral extraction of lower third
molars were selected to perform the surgery and to conduct
the research, and on the day of the procedure, patients
received capsules containing 100 mg of valerian or 15 mg
of midazolam orally 60 minutes before procedures in a randomized
crossover, split mouth. As a result, it was not possible
to identify changes in physiological parameters that were assessed at
specific times during surgery. In addition, in the postoperative period,
patients completed a questionnaire self-assessing their level of anxiety. This
questionnaire pointed out that when Valerian was used, no patient
reported anterograde amnesia while the use of midazolam caused this
effect in 40% of respondents, which may have a direct
effect in the fact that 55% of patients prefer the
surgery in which valerian was administered. in direct comparison to
midazolam. These results demonstrated that valerian appears to have the
potential to provide patients with the necessary comfort and relaxation
without sedation and less drowsiness than midazolam.
