One of the main findings of this study is the
scarcity of theses and dissertations in the field of medical
translation in Brazil. As it is an area that contributes
a lot to the advancement of science, we expected it
to be a promising area for translators and, as such,
we expected to find many more studies in our searches
than the ones we have actually found.
