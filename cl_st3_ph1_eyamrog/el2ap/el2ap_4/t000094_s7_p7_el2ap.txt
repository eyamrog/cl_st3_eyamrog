If children are to be taught to actively engage with
the interpretive possibilities of images, they need to develop their
understanding of the meaning-making systems deployed in images. This entails
a shared metalanguage â€“ a language for describing visual meaning-making
resources somewhat analogous to a grammatical description of the meaning-making
systems available in verbal texts.
