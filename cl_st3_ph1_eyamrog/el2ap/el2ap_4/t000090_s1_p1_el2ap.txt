The present paper studies the Dimensions and Indicators of the
academic international multidimensional ranking “U-Multirank”. The study of this ranking
is important in Brazil nowadays, because the new evaluation of
the graduate programmes in Brazil is using many aspects of
multidimensional evaluation, including some concepts used by the U-Multirank. This
ranking shows the weaknesses and strengths of each Academic Institution,
using five Dimensions that are composed by 36 Indicators. This
large number of Dimensions and Indicators gives a more complete
view of the Universities, but raise questions about their independence
and data availability. The top 300 European Academic Institutions listed
in the 2020 edition are analyzed, explaining the Dimensions and
Indicators and making statistical correlations between them.
