The Irish schooling system, as currently established, is predominantly denominational
in character, and the provision of RE is mainly under
the responsibility of particular churches and religious organisations. According to
the national Constitution, this arrangement is supposed to support freedom
of conscience and religion, by allowing parents to rear their
children in the faith of their choice. What is more,
it points towards a general acknowledgement of the importance of
RE for citizens – with the opt out clause being
an exception to the norm – though structured according to
different denominational perspectives.
