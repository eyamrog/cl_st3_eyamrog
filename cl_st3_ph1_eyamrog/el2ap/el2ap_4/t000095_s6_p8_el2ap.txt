On the other hand, the greater risk of dying of
COVID-19 in public hospitals compared to private ones indicates the
need for better-equipped public services. According to Paim 10, chronic
underfunding of Brazil's Unified Health System (SUS) is one of
the major problems. The Federal Government reduced its share of
63.8% of public spending on health in 1995 to about
42% in 2017. In 1994, the Federal Government created the
Emergency Social Fund, which promoted, in 2016, the removal of
30% of the Social Security Budget for other expenses. Also,
the Constitutional Amendment NÂº 95 implemented in 2016, established a
spending ceiling for the Federal Government and froze public resources
for health for 20 years 11 12.
