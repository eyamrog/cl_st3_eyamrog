To achieve the goal of this research paper, a qualitative
approach was employed with an exploratory-descriptive scope to characterize and
determine the most important features of each of the modules
of the curriculum (Hernández, Fernández & Baptista 2010). A documentary
research design was applied comprising all the information records (Méndez
& Astudillo 2008), through the search, retrieval, analysis, criticism and
interpretation of the data located on the Internet (Arias 2012).
