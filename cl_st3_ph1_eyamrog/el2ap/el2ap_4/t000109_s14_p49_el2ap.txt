Here P(t) represents the probability of being in contact with
the virus through a plastic surface; t is the time
elapsed since the fomite was handled, in hours, and temp
is the daily mean temperature. This formula was implemented in
the system GIS projection, making each cell where an infected
Ha remained able to infect another Ha with the corresponding
probability P(t). This factor has been included for model completeness
reasons, since it is related to several hygiene measures adopted
for the prevention of this disease. In practice and in
most recent literature it has been shown that it has
no significant impact.
