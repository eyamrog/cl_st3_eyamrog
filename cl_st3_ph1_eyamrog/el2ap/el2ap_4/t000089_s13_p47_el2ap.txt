In voluntary-controlled schools and community schools, RE syllabus of each
LEA reflects the official policy regarding the communitarian aspects of
the educative process, which stems from an experiential conception of
learning. For instance, the Birmingham Agreed Syllabus (2007) explores local
features of the development of the Christian faith, while also
taking into account childrenâ€™s diverse family backgrounds in the classroom
so as to include other religions traditions in the RE
programme in view of their representation in the local community.
Throughout the document, the role of the parents, churches and
communal associations in the religious and ethical formation of pupils
is emphasised, along with an empathetic view of the capacity
for mutual understanding between adepts of different faiths.
