Finally, the results from the “neutral” and “biased” sentences were
quite different. Although Portuguese speakers were still influenced by PAS,
especially when the anaphor was an ellipsis in Portuguese or
Spanish, we have concluded that the lexical choice of verbs
and the meaning relation between them has a great influence
on the task resolution of ambiguous anaphora. This aspect of
the study has received little attention (if any) in previous
studies. In view of these results, we posit that the
semantics of the verb combination should also be considered when
producing ambiguous sentences for anaphora resolution tasks.
