The sampling method used the protocol proposed by Buss (2008),
with the adaptations proposed by CETESB (2019), which indicates that
sampling should consider the existence of different mesohabitats, such as,
fine substrate (fine sands and muds), thicker materials (coarser sands),
and also gravel and pebbles and loose rocks, and others.
In the case of Cachoeira do Paraíso waterfall, the environment
was characterized as a mesohabitat of thick substrate, which is
expected to present less biodiversity in comparison to the others
(BUSS, 2008). Each sampling site was sampled in three different
sections, within the same mesohabitat, using a sieve with 05-0.6
mm mesh (BUSS, 2008), by the kick sampling technique, where
the collection was made on the substrate (BUSS, 2008; FEELEY
et al., 2011; CETESB, 2019). The collected organisms were trialed
under a stereo’s microscope, separated from the sediment and fixed
in 40% alcohol. Then, they were examined and their taxonomic
classification was made, as further described.
