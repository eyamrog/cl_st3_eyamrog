Whereas in Ireland denominational schooling comprises around 90% of the
primary and secondary sectors, in England this model is confined
to voluntary-aided schools, independent schools, and faith academies, which provide
denominational teaching for one third of children. In fact, independent
schools make up only 1% of the total number of
schools in the country, catering for around 7% of pupils,
while faith-maintained schools provide RE for around 25% of the
children. The remaining two thirds of English pupils attend maintained
schools of no religious character which, however, offer RE classes
according to the orientation of each LEA.
