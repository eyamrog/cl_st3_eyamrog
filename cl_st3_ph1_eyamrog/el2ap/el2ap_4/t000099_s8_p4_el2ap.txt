NS lead to shoot formation from an axillary bud meristem
that is stimulated after apical dominance is broken due to
the node isolation from the mother plant (George et al.
2008). However, no studies about respiration during in vitro plantlet
development from lateral buds and how it compares to seed
germination were found.
