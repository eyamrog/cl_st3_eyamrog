Understanding the setting of the event might explain why one
of every four attendees was found positive. Of the total
164 attendees, 86.4% reported being present for 2 or more
hours, where 82.9% were mostly in the enclosed non-ventilated environment
and 87.8% did not use face masks nor kept social
distancing measures. High volume music was played at all times
in the indoor non- ventilated area, increasing the risk of
SARS-CoV-2 transmission through elevated vocal effort contributing to higher aerosol
emissions (Kopechek, 2020; Bergwerk et al., 2021). Of the 41
COVID-19 resulting positive individuals, 37 (90.3%) were at the event
for over 2 hours, reported being in the enclosed environment
at all times and none (100%) used a face mask
at any time. The only mitigating measure that the adolescents
took to ensure a safe event was to perform a
rapid antigen test 24 hours prior to the event, in
which two adolescents were positive and still attended the event.
Of these two positive individuals, one was vaccinated and reported
wearing a face mask at all times while the other
positive individual was not vaccinated and did not wear a
face mask at all. This superspreading event shows the lack
of knowledge, low risk assessment and the hesitance to implement
several layers of protection. The analysis of this superspreading event
shows how taking only one measure, in this case the
24-hour prior antigen test, was not enough to minimize the
risk of infection. As the Swiss Cheese Model by James
Reason suggests, (Perneger, 2005; Azuma et al., 2020) knowing that
there isn't a mitigation measure with 100% protection it is
imperative to employ several layers of protection to reduce the
risk of transmission and infection. In this scenario, without multiple
transmission mitigation measures like admitting only negative adolescents, having proper
ventilation, universal use of face masks, lower volume music, and
social distancing, the superspreading event occurred.
