The O2 consumption and CO2 release rates in seeds of
A. strobilacea peaked at 14 days of culture (figure 3),
corresponding to full seedling formation (figure 2). Contrarily, respiratory rates
in NS peaked at 7 days (figure 3), being five
times higher than seeds and before the detection of leaf
emergence at 14 days. Therefore, we may assume that NS
showed a more intense and earlier requirement for energy generation
through respiration than seeds for initiating plant formation. The isolation
of nodes and apical dominance release stimulates cytokinin accumulation in
the excised tissue, leading to cell proliferation in the lateral
buds and new shoots formation (Souza et al. 2010, Buchanan
et al. 2015, Li et al. 2018). Thus, respiratory activity
would increase accordingly to provide sufficient energy for cell division
during shoot formation and multiplication process (Siqueira et al. 2018).
Accordingly, it is reported that sugar accumulates in NS cultivated
in vitro as to promote bud outgrowth and provide substrates
for respiration to sustain the intense cell division (see review
by Schneider et al. 2019). A similar pattern was previously
described for the bromeliad Ananas comosus (Souza et al. 2010).
Furthermore, the higher respiration rates in NS than in seeds
may be due to the multiple bud breaks in the
former (table 1, figures 1b and c).
