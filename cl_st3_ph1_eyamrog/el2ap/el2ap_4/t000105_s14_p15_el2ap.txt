In the week prior to the collection, the research team
carried out the enrollment of households in pre-selected census sectors
and developed plans to raise awareness in the population through
the distribution of folders and posters in public places as
well as the dissemination of the survey via local radio
stations, social media (Instagram and Facebook), the University TV, WhatsApp
groups, and religious celebrations.
