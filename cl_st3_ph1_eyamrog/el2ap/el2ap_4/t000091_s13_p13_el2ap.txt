Because valerenic acid is capable of interacting with the GABA
system, a mechanism of action similar to benzodiazepine drugs, a
study in rats compared the effects of this herb with
diazepam and analyzed its chemical composition. The results showed a
significant reduction in the anxiety behavior of the animals that
received the valerian extract and valerenic acid, therefore confirming the
evidence that Valeriana officinalis is a viable alternative to traditional
anxiolytics (Murphy et al., 2010). Recently, in another study with
rats submitted to physical or psychological stress, the administration of
0.5 mg/Kg of valerenic acid once daily for 3 weeks
decreased the response to physical and psychological stress (Jung et
al., 2015).
