Rivers protection is fundamental for the socioecological systems, and the
benthic macroinvertebrates communities can be used to assess the quality
of river waters. This study aimed to assess the water
quality at Cachoeira do Paraíso waterfall, Peruíbe, SP, based on
the benthic macrofauna. Sampling took place at 3 sampling sites,
under different levels of anthropic influence. Water physical-chemical and sedimentological
parameters were evaluated, as well as macrobenthic organisms. Samplings were
done by kick sampling technique. The organisms were identified at
the lowest possible taxonomic level and points were attributed to
each group according to their respective sensitivity and tolerance to
pollutants. Then, a biological index was calculated to indicate the
water quality. Ecological indices were calculated and compared using ANOVA.
The water physical-chemical parameters showed to be within the legal
standards. 13 taxonomic groups of benthic macroinvertebrates were identified, with
the Shannon diversity indices indicating similar taxonomic diversity. The score
given to each taxa generated biological indices for each sample,
ranging from regular to excellent. Diptera (with head) I was
the most representative taxon, and sensitive taxonomic groups, were found
in all the sampling sites, suggesting a good quality of
the water body during the period of study.
