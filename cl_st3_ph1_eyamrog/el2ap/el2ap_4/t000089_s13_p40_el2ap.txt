In line with Wright and Hella’s thinking, my proposal is
for a model of RE in which religious traditions and
even secular worldviews can contribute to a process of moral
learning, whereby – in contrast with a neutralist framework of
public reason – pupils’ autonomous thinking in the school is
promoted through the communication and evaluation of substantive ethical claims
of justice in a critical and pluralistic manner. Nonetheless, in
order to avoid confusion with a specific form of RE
provided by religious schools, which is usually known as confessional,
I will classify as tradition-oriented conception of RE those perspectives
that endorse the link between substantive cultural values and educative
enterprises, while making a distinction between the denominational model of
schooling and an ethical-dialogical RE – with the latter referring
to those multidenominational models that promote inter-faith dialogue through the
articulation of comprehensive beliefs and experiential knowledge. Although both models
can be linked to a tradition-oriented conception of RE, I
contend that an ethical- dialogical education is more equipped to
meet the requirements of a context-transcendent rationality, as Maeve Cooke
has defined.
