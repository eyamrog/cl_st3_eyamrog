Paleolimnological studies have proved to be a valuable tool for
the increase of environmental biodiversity and floristic changes reconstructions (e.g.
Smol 2008, Bennion & Simpson 2011, Davidson & Jeppesen 2013,
Wengrat et al. 2018). Moreover, past environmental communities are very
often the only available source of information when researching biodiversity
prior to human impacts (Smol 2002, Le Treut et al.
2007).
