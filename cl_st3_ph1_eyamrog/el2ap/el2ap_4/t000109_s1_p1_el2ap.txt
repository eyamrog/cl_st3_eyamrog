In this paper, an agent-based model that predicts a daily
evolution of the number of people hospitalized in intensive care
due to COVID-19 is presented, including results for 2020. In
addition, the number of deaths, reported cases, asymptomatic individuals and
other epidemiological variables of interest, discriminated by age range, are
considered. The most relevant characteristics of the climate in Paraná
city (Entre Ríos, Argentina), its social dynamics and public transportation
are considered as inputs, taking also into account the different
phases of isolation and social distancing. By means of a
set of Hidden Markov Models, the system reproduces virus transmission
associated with people’s mobility and activities in the city. Spread
of the virus in the host is also simulated by
following the stages of the disease, and by considering the
existence of comorbidities and a proportion of asymptomatic infected people.
By adjusting the model to match the data on hospitalizations
in intensive care units and deaths due to COVID-19 in
the city under study, the system can be operated to
analyze the impact of isolation and social distancing measures on
the population dynamics. In addition, it allows simulating combinations of
characteristics leading to a potential collapse in the health system
due to lack of infrastructure, as well as predicting the
impact of social events or the increase in people’s mobility.
