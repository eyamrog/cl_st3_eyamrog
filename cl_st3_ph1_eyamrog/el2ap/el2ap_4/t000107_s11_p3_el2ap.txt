Bibliometrics studies the productivity of scientific and technological agents through
the analysis of bibliographic sources and patents, the identification of
relationships, organizational patterns, fads, critical points, trends, counterpoints, among other
pieces of information relevant to both information management and processes
of dissemination of scientific products. (Vasconcelos, 2014, p. 211, our
