More than a year after its inception, the Covid-19 statistical
monitoring remains a challenge. Although the tests that prove contagion
are much more widely available today than in the early
stages of the pandemic, not only is there still a
disparity in the access to them among localities and social
groups [O’DRISCOLL et al., 2021: 140], but also the effects
of the previous bottleneck persist on any cumulative indicator of
cases. The use of other variables in principle relevant to
epidemiological follow-up, such as the numbers of hospitalizations, ICU admissions
and intubations, is restricted by the different criteria used to
define these events and, mainly, by the fact that they
are not reported by most official systems that disclose information
on the subject. For all these reasons, it is widely
recognized that the number of deaths is a more reliable
indicator of the size of the epidemic [O’DRISCOLL et al.,
2021: 140] and for the understanding of its dynamics [HALLAL,
2020: 2403]. HEUVELINE and TZEN (2021: 6) also maintain that
data on deaths are more comparable – and more reliable,
although not totally immune to underestimates [ORELLANA et al., 2020]
-, which makes them particularly relevant to evaluate public policy
measures to address the pandemic. None of this, of course,
implies ignoring the enormous human cost of cases of the
disease that do not culminate in death.
