In England, the development of RE teaching in voluntary controlled
and community schools offers great potential for mutual learning and
dialogical criticism through the articulation of substantive ethical perceptions from
each pupilâ€™s faith experience. As the Birmingham and Cornwall syllabuses
illustrate, by focusing on particular social and historical features of
religious practice in their respective areas, RE allows for valuable
insights into the reasons, values and concepts that different religious
traditions attribute to spiritual practices and commitments, therefore permitting the
contextual appreciation of teleological meanings and truth claims from those
faith communities. Emphasis on the background of pupils and the
encouragement of family involvement also ensures that spiritual learning and
development begin from within the schemes of rationality of particular
belief-systems, while including new perceptions and valuations in due course.
