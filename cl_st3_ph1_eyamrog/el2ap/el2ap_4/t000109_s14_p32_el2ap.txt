- T: This state represents the work or study location
of each Ha. This point on the geographical map can
be shared by multiple human agents. For some Ha, it
coincides with that of their home (for those who do
not work or study). The work/study location is fixed for
each Ha, and it is selected at the beginning of
the run from a list of possible places. Each place
has different probabilities of being selected for human agents according
to their age ranges.
