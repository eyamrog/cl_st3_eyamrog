“There was some nasty political persecution at the Ministry of
I, of civil servants who were ostracized because they were
thought to be linked to political parties. All these changes
happened because all civil servants were seen with distrust. I
had to earn the trust of those who arrived, to
convince them I wanted to do a good job and
that I was not there to sabotage what was being
done” (interview 47).
