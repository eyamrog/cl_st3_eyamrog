The researchers (JS and VBL) carried out the searches on
the databases mentioned and, then, they systematized the organization of
the articles selected according to the title and abstract. Those
that did not meet the objectives of the study were
excluded. After this screening, the articles were read in full,
so that the selection process of the ones that would
be included in this study was completed (Figure 1).
