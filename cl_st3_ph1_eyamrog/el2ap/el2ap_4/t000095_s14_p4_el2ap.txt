For descriptive analysis, absolute and percentage values for patient’s characteristics
were presented. The risk of death between Rio de Janeiro
and São Paulo was estimated using logistic regression models adjusted
for age, sex, and comorbidities. The analyses were performed for
the state and capital levels. Missing information for all comorbidities
was assumed as a lack of morbidity. Two sensitivity analyses
were performed. One to evaluate possible differences in the rate
of the notification process, by removing November and December data
from analysis. The other one evaluated the impact of outcome
missing data, assuming all missing as a cure.
