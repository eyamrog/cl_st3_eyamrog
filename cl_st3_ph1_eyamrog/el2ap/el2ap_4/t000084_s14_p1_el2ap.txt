The research context was an 8-week continuing education course focusing
on the use of mobile devices in language learning. This
course, part of a project from the School of Letters
of a prestigious university in Brazil, was offered to K-12
in-service English teachers from different parts of the country. Due
to the high number of teachers enrolled (N = 227),
six groups were formed and mediated simultaneously.
