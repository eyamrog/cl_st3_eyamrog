Apart from the salience of the anaphor, the order of
the clauses may also affect anaphora resolution. The hypothesis of
the Active Search Mechanism (ASM), from Kazanina et al. (2007),
suggests that, in cases of pronominal cataphora in English (as
in (8)), speakers would choose the first possible antecedent that
appears after the anaphor. Usually, the first possible antecedent is
the subject of the main clause.
