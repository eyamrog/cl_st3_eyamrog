There is a scarcity of research in the context of
the benthic ecology of rivers and creeks along the Atlantic
coast of Brazil, especially within protected areas, such as the
Jureia-Itatins Mosaic, where the PEIt is located. Thus, the present
study is extremely relevant in terms of providing new information
regarding water quality and the composition, diversity and status of
benthic macroinvertebrates at the Cachoeira do Para√≠so waterfall.
