In order to determine how participants’ attitudes relate to the
use of emojis for cognitive, teaching, and social presences, three
Spearman Rho analyses were conducted with participants’ responses on the
post survey (N = 61) and emoji use for each
of the presences. Results of the Spearman Rho analysis suggested
that emoji use in terms of cognitive presence was significantly,
positively correlated to participants’ attitudes regarding their readiness to use
mobile devices in the language classroom (rs = .32, p
= .01). In other words, the more ready they are
to use mobile devices, the more often they used emojis
to support cognitive presence throughout the course. This suggests that
the more familiarity participants had with WhatsApp, the more likely
they were to use all of its resources, including emojis,
to exchange information, connect ideas, and apply new knowledge. However,
emoji use in terms of social (rs = .20, p
= .12) or teaching presence (rs = -.09, p =
.48) failed to correlate to participants’ attitudes regarding their readiness
to use mobile devices in the language classroom. Given the
rise in popularity in emoji use in the last decade,
it is not surprising that participants used emojis similarly, regardless
of their attitudes, to encourage collaboration and express their emotions.
What was probably most surprising was that participants, as discussed
in the Teaching Presence section above, took on the role
of teacher frequently to assist other students in the class,
regardless of their attitudes, which explains why these items were
not correlated. See Table 6.
