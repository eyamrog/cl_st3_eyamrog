An efficient conservation method for endangered plant species is the
development of in vitro germplasm banks, since they allow the
storage of a great number of plants in small spaces,
without excessive maintenance as required for plants in the field
or greenhouses (Imarhiagbe et al. 2016, Oseni et al. 2018).
This technique can be applied to seeds or tissue explants,
such as nodal segments (NS, Pilatti et al. 2011). The
ornamental bromeliad Acanthostachys strobilacea (Schult. & Schult.f.) Klotzsch (Bromeliaceae) can
be propagated in vitro by seeds and NS isolated from
the stems of elongated plants that are subcultured to obtain
new plants (Santos et al. 2010). Micropropagation has been used
in the cultivation of diverse bromeliads species to meet the
ornamental plants market demand, which aids in preventing illegal extraction
(Mercier & Nievola 2003, Negrelle et al. 2012). Due to
the possibility of maintaining cultures in controlled conditions (light, temperature,
nutrients, etc.), this technique has been used for studies of
basic physiology in diverse species (Narayani & Srivastava 2017, Bakhshipour
et al. 2019, Chetty et al. 2020), including bromeliads (Carvalho
et al. 2013, Freitas et al. 2015, Andrade & Tamaki
2016, Santos et al. 2017, Silva et al. 2017, Andrade-Santos
et al. 2020, Silva et al. 2020).
