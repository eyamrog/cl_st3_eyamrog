The analysis of the results was carried out with the
statistical package IBM® SPSS® (23rd version). Normality in the distribution
of continuous variables was determined using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Quantitative
variables of parametric distribution were described by means and standard
deviation and those non-parametric by means of the median and
range. Qualitative variables were expressed in percentages.
