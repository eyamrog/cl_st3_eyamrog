Figure 8 shows that, contrary to our first findings (see
Figure 7), the four theses catalogued in Domínio Público had
also been catalogued on both the BDTD and the Catálogo
de Teses e Dissertações da CAPES websites. It also makes
it clear that the latter is the most accurate, as
it catalogues all the theses and dissertations found both on
the Domínio Público and the BDTD websites. Table 4, gives
the title of all the theses and dissertations found as
well as the websites from which they can be retrieved.
