The rest of the themes are ‘our adventures’, ‘the kitchen’,
‘the park’ or ‘a game’, i.e., they refer to the
things Emily does or to the places where actions take
place. However, there are some examples of marked themes (25%),
whenever there is a textual theme before the topical one
before the conjunctions ‘and/but’, the adverbial ‘sometimes’, the prepositional phrase
‘On a damp and rainy day’, page 14, ‘there’, ‘then’,
and ‘so’.
