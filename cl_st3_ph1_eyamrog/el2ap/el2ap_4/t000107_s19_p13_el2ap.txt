Despite the different keywords and filters used in the searches
conducted on the three websites, the theses and dissertations retrieved
from the BDTD and the Catálogo de Teses e Dissertações
da CAPES were practically the same. The scarcity of theses
and dissertations on the Domínio Público website seem to suggest
lack of data feeding.
