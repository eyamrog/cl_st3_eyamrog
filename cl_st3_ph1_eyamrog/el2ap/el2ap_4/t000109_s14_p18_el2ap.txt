Finally, this submodel takes into account an attribute of each
Ha that is defined by the level of observance of
social distancing. This attribute, distancing, has two possible values: high
or low. In the event that Ha has high level
of observance, before taking any position in the geographical grid
that does not correspond to its home, it checks that
there is no other agent in a diameter of 1.8
m. If this condition is verified, then Ha takes the
place. If not, it waits until the corresponding capacity allows
it. On the other hand, if distancing has a low
value, then, when this Ha moves, it takes the corresponding
place, regardless the allowed capacity.
