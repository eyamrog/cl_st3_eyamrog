Recently, (Dantas et al., 2017) verified that, when administering Passiflora
incarnata (260 mg) or midazolam (15 mg) orally 30 minutes
prior to the extraction of impacted mandibular third molars, Passiflora
incarnata showed an anxiolytic effect similar to midazolam and was
safe and effective for conscious sedation in adult patients who
underwent oral surgery. It may be an important pharmacological alternative
for the management of anxiety during dental treatment.
