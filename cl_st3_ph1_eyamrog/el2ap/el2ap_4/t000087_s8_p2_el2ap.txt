Previous studies have shown that adolescents are less prone to
severe COVID-19, hospitalization and death due to COVID-19 compared to
adults (CDC, 2021; Stein, 2021). Also, some studies report that
COVID-19 positive adolescents have mild respiratory symptoms, namely fever, dry
cough, and fatigue or are asymptomatic (Castagnoli et al., 2020).
Less than 1% can develop multi systemic inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C)
(Hoste, Van Paemel and Haerynck, 2021) and 5.1% can develop
Long COVID (Mellis, 2021).
