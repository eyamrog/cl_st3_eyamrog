Importantly, in exploring each religion’s worldviews, as well as their
rituals and practices, the students are supposed to develop an
appreciation for each of them, looking for similarities and “common
links” between these traditions. Thus, despite its aim of fostering
critical thinking, the curriculum is rather cautious when it comes
to dealing with divergent perspectives, as it assumes that there
are overlapping elements and values that bring different traditions together.
This trend can be observed throughout the document’s explanation of
the goals of the ‘Belief Systems’ strand. In the first
strand unit, “Introducing Key Figures in the Major Belief Systems”,
it sets out that fifth and sixth should: “identify any
common features which may exist between religious leaders, e.g. the
emergence of different Christian traditions, the problems that arose across
these traditions and the move towards closer integration” (Educate Together,
2004, p 36). Similarly, the second strand unit, “Rites and
Ceremonies”, establishes that children should be enabled to “discuss the
similarities and differences across the major belief systems in respect
of ritual and ceremony and identify any common links between
these rites” (Educate Together, 2004, p. 37). The same is
true for the other two strand units, namely, “Celebrations” and
“Beliefs and Values”, in which students should find commonalities among
different religious festivals (Educate Together, 2004: 38), as well as
across distinct code and value systems (Educate Together, 2004, p.
39).
