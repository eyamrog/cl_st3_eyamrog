“We see a lot of paralysis. The Minister is a
church pastor. A pastor who had no past career in
the field of I. He was supposedly linked to a
University, but he was just a professor there, he was
not part of the University’s administration. He was a church
pastor. (…) So it is a policy of dismantling, of
not doing anything” (interview 58).
