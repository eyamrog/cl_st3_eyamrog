The PEIt has several trails, used for visitation, monitoring, circulation,
etc.; including that used to access the Cachoeira do Paraíso
waterfall (Figure 1), as previously mentioned (SMA, 2009; MAGINI and
ABESSA, 2017). The waterfall is located between the Itatins Mountain
Ridge and the coastal plain, with an altitude of 35m,
and it does not have a vertical drop, but a
17-meter step, called Paraíso toboggan. Its access path is reasonably
preserved; however, the existence of trails and visitation can generate
impacts, such as habitat fragmentation, erosion, silting, soil compaction, soil
and water pollution (SMA, 2009).
