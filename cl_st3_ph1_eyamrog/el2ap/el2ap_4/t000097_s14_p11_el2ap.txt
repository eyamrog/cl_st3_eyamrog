The Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool was used34 in order to assess
the methodological quality of the studies. The following criteria were
evaluated: (1) random sequence generation, (2) allocation sequence hiding, (3)
the participants and researchersâ€™ masking, and (4) selective reporting. The
masking items regarding the evaluation of the outcomes, as well
as the incomplete data were not included in the study,
since study protocols do not show intervention results. The researchers'
judgment (JS, ACAG) on the review was rated as low,
unclear, or as having a high risk of bias.
