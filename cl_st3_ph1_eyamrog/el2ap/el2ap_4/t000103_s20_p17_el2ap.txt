If we compare Tables 4 and 5, we can see
that participants’ answers were influenced by the verb combination of
the biased sentences, especially the natives’ ones. When there was
a semantic preference corresponding to PAS, those percentages have increased,
except for intermediate learners, whose preferential choice for zero anaphora
has decreased, although it was still the subject of the
main clause. When the semantic preference was opposite to PAS,
native speakers were more influenced by semantics. Although learners were
also influenced by semantics, their preferential choice has only changed
for pronominal cataphora (except for Portuguese intermediate learners, who did
not show a preference - but, again, there were only
4 participants in this group). As we have seen with
the Portuguese biased sentences, Portuguese speakers still seem to be
influenced by PAS when there is an ellipsis in subject
position. Thus, their choice to correspond the ellipsis in subject
position of the subordinate clauses to the subject of the
main clauses decreased in cases of zero cataphora, but it
was still their preference.
