During his first 100 days in office, Jair Bolsonaro issued
an executive order that became famously known in Brazil as
“revogaço”, the massive cancelation of 250 executive orders that had
been issued by his predecessors dating all the way back
to 1901.2 During the first 24 hours of his administration,
Joe Biden similarly signed 15 new executive orders, many of
those repealing past decisions and policies that had been enacted
by Donald Trump. The two acts may seem comparable and,
in fact, some may argue that they are the expected
result of the democratic process. However, when one looks deep
into the current Brazilian state apparatus, the level and nature
of policy dismantling occurring at the Brazilian federal government set
the country apart from ordinary, post-­‐election policy change following the
replacement of the political party in office.
