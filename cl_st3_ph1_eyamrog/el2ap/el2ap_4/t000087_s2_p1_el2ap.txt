We would like to thank Sandra López-León MD PhD for
her guidance as an epidemiologist, physician and her support in
the data analysis and interpretation. Bioethicist German Carreto Chavez reviewed
and approved the questioner and the project. He determined that
there was no risk for any of the participants. That
anonymization of the participant was guaranteed, and the bioethical international
guidelines were followed since all participants and/or their parents, when
needed, were signed. A special thanks to Ariela Landsmanas Goldberg
for providing crucial information and helping with the distribution of
the questionnaire. We acknowledge Ricardo Grande and Karel Estrada for
their support in sequencing and bioinformatics technical support, respectively and
who are part of the “Unidad Universitaria de Secuenciación Masiva
y Bioinformática - UNAM'' and "Laboratorio Nacional de Apoyo Tecnológico
a las Ciencias Genómicas - CONACyT"
