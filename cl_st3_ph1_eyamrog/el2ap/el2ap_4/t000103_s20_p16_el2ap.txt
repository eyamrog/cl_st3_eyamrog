Spanish learners tend to interpret ellipsis in the subject position
of the subordinate clause as corresponding to the subject of
the main clause, especially Brazilians in cases of zero anaphora.
However, participants did not show a clear preference for the
antecedent of the pronoun. Again, the alternative other was only
chosen in cases of pronominal cataphora, and only by native
speakers and Portuguese advanced learners. In fact, the two groups
of EP speakers presented opposite results for pronominal cataphora, and
the intermediate learners were closer to native speakers than advanced
learners. It is important to say that the size of
each group was very different, and the intermediate one only
had 4 participants.
