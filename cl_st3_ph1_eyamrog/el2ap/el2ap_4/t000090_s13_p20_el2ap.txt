Table 1 shows all the Indicators used by the “U-Multirank”,
divided into the five Dimensions. It shows the description of
each Indicator, the amount of data available, not available and
data that “do not apply”, as well as the source
of the data, divided into two categories: “IQ”, which means
data obtained from questionnaires answered by the institutions; or “IND”,
which represents data available from independent sources, like the Web
of Science.
