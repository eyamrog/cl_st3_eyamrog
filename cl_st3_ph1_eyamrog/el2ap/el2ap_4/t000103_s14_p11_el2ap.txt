Half of the sentences had anaphora, and the other half
had cataphora. Half of them had a salient anaphor (unstressed
pronoun in Portuguese or Spanish; stressed pronoun in English), and
the other half had a non-salient anaphor (ellipsis in Portuguese
or Spanish; unstressed pronoun in English). Participants were instructed to
consider pronouns written in capital letters as stressed2. Sentence (9),
above, showed an example of stressed pronominal anaphora, while sentence
(10), below, shows an example of unstressed pronominal cataphora in
English.
