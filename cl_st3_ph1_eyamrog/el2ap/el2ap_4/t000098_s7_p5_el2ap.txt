Therefore, the primary objective of this article is to calculate
Covid-19 mortality rates adjusted by differences in age pyramids based
on data on mortality by age group. Both the difficulty
of obtaining this information and its relevance to other studies
suggest that gathering data on mortality from the disease by
age groups into a single source for the countries most
affected by the pandemic is in itself a relevant secondary
objective.
