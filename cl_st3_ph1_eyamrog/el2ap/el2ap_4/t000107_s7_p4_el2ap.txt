The interdisciplinary nature of our research, i.e., its interface with
the medical field, also justifies the need to promote studies
like the present one. Hereinafter, the medical field will be
referred to as domain knowledge. Studies show that domain knowledge
impacts both the process and the translation product (Da Silva
at al., 2009; Da Silva & Silveira, 2017). Research that
seeks to map certain fields of translation domains has been
undertaken before (Barcelos & Malta, 2020; Esqueda, 2020), with a
view to contribute both to the dissemination of knowledge and
to the identifying of the most and least studied topics.
The mapping carried out in this paper seeks to do
the same, that is, to identify the topics that generate
the most interest from researchers in the field of translation
studies in Brazil and reveal possible knowledge gaps.
