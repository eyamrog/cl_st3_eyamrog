The water quality depends on its physical, chemical and biological
variables. The physical- chemical parameters are important but measurements made
punctually indicate instantaneous conditions that can be or not indicative
of the general conditions of water quality. On the other
hand, resident organisms may monitor water quality over time (GORNI;
ALVES:, 2012). The physical-chemical parameters of the Itinguçu River were
within the normal ranges determined by the federal standards for
protected areas (Class 1 waters), and were also comparable to
those reported in the literature for environments with good water
quality (LUTZ, 1968; YANOVIAK 1999ª; HROVAT et al., 2009; MONTEIRO
et al., 2008; TANIWAKI; SMITH:, 2011;TSZYDEL et al., 2015). In
addition, these values were similar to those found in the
rivers located in the Intervales State Park, SP (ALVES et
al., 2008; MELO, 2009).
