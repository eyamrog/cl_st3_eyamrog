Studies show that domain knowledge has an impact not only
on the translation process, but also on the final product
presented, that is, the translated text itself (Scardamalia & Bereiter,
1991; Da Silva, 2007). According to Scardamalia and Bereiter (1991),
domain knowledge is the knowledge that individuals have about a
specific area or field of interest. Thus, in abroad sense,
in the case of translation studies, domain knowledge refers to
all knowledge, skills, and competencies related to how a text
is translated and how it is likely to influence the
end product. However, translators are frequently faced with texts from
different areas. This seems to be especially true in the
case of medical texts. In this context, knowledge of translation
techniques and topics, plays an important part in both the
translation process and product.
