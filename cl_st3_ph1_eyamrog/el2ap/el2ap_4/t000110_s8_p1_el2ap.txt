Holocene is the most recent interval of Earth history encompassing
the present day. Together with the Pleistocene series it forms
the Quaternary period, and possibly is the most intensively studied
interval of recent geological time (Suguio 1999). Despite being a
relatively short geological period, sedimentary evidence from the Holocene are
sufficiently well preserved, thus enabling comparisons with data of the
same nature in current processes (Walkers & Geissman 2009).
