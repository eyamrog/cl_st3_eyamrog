The neutralist-liberal conception of Religious Education (RE) is characterised by
a particular emphasis on the idea of impartiality, which is
supposed to be achieved when the educative process is carried
out in a “objective, critical and pluralistic” manner, as in
accordance with the normative principles supported by the European Court
of Human Rights (Folgerø v. Norway, 2007; Hasan and Eylem
Zengin v. Turkey, 2008; Lautsi v. Italy, 2011). As I
will show, this perspective points to the assumption that there
is a neutral, independent standpoint of reason, which is the
source of normative values and scientific standards for any educative
enterprise. Underlining this perspective is a secular view of public
morality, as well as a formal account of the educative
process, which separates cognitive knowledge from its practical dimension.
