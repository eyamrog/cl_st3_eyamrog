In Figure 2 we present the symptoms reported both by
the vaccinated and unvaccinated adolescents. The mean number of symptoms
was 6 in both the vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts. Vaccinated
adolescents reported a runny nose more frequently (87.5% vs 48.5%
p=0.046). Unvaccinated adolescents reported fatigue more frequently (90.9% vs 62.5%
p=0.04). The rest of the reported symptoms, including anosmia, were
present in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals (75.0% and 72.7%
respectively).
