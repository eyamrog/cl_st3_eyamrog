The data collection process included listing and approaching households, recruiting
participants, the collection of venous blood, and interviews. The activities
were carried out during weekends (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), aiming
to enhance the participation of residents who worked during the
week and increasing the representativeness of this population group.
