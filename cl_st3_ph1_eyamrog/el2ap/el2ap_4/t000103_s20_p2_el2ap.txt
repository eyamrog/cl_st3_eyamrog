In general, Portuguese and Brazilian students presented similar results in
this initial test, though participants from Portugal and Spanish learners
achieved a slightly higher score than the others, as seen
in Table 1. To identify whether there is a difference
in anaphora resolution depending on the respondentsâ€™ proficiency level in
the language, we have decided to divide the sample in
two groups: intermediate and advanced learners of each language.
