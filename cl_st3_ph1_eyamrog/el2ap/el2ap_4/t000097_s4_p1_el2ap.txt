The study protocols showed different possibilities of intervention through physical
activity and/or physical exercise; however, some have limitations due to
the lack of information, such as intensity, frequency or timing
of the sessions, which are necessary for a better use
of these interventions. It should be highlighted that the first
study protocol found in this scoping review dates from 2013,
which shows that previous clinical trials did not have protocol
publications, and that the practice of publishing study protocols is
still expanding. Not all scientific journals accept this type of
study, and some authors of randomized clinical trials choose not
to publish their protocols.
