On the same day, the Presidency’s official tweeter account (@planalto)
tagged Lorenzoni and announced: “We will review issues related to
[participatory] Councils. On the executive order, Conselhão [Economic and Social
Development Council] has already been extinguished. We will do a
detailed review (pente fino) of all the councils within federal
administration”. In Brazilian Portuguese, the image of “pente fino”, a
thin comb, signifies a strict process of scrutiny meant to
detect parasites.
