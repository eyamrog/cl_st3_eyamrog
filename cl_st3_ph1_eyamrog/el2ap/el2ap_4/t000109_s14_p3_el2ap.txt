The most important relationships between human agents, regarding COVID-19 epidemiology,
are represented in the Interpersonal Contact submodel (Section 4.1). This
submodel also presents human agentsâ€™ relationships with each other, with
the plots of land, and with the environment. These relationships
are affected by average distance in the different places they
attend, how long the stay and the observance of mask
use and social distancing rules (Sections 4.1 and 4.2).
