Figure 6 shows the number of daily COVID-19 cases (symptomatic
and asymptomatic) estimated by the model in the period under
analysis. In this case, official numbers only consider a sample
of the actual total cases, since official reports are highly
dependent on testing policies and on cases monitoring, appart from
the difficulty in detecting asymptomatic cases. The model estimates that
the number of actually infected people is larger than that
showed by official reports. This agrees with the bibliography reported
for other case studies [49].
