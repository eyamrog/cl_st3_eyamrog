Baroreflex can be evaluated by analysis in the time domain:
mean of RR intervals, standard deviation, RMSSD, etc. Likewise, the
analysis of heart rate variability in the frequency domain using
the Fourier transform is of immense value. In this way,
the LH and HF indices are obtained, the quotient of
which represents the sympathetic vagal equilibrium.
