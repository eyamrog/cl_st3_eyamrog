Throughout this article, I have challenged the idea that an
impartial, neutralist conception of RE is possible, or even desirable,
by pointing out the links between the object of science
and the rational subject, arguing that the observer is constrained
by their own historical narratives and epistemic conceptions in the
process of selecting and evaluate evidences. Afterwards, I demonstrated that
multidenominational models of RE that preclude a critical appreciation of
substantive truth and moral claims articulated by religious belief systems,
fail to acknowledge the moral potential of their conceptual stock
of meanings for bringing about emancipatory shifts in perception. Although
the aim of RE is not to make pupils arrive
at any particular conclusion about the value of faith contents
at the school, it fosters the process whereby citizens develop
critical capacities to make their own choices in their own
time.
