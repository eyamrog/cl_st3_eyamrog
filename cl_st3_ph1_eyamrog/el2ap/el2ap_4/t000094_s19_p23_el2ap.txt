There are two general patterns in the relationship between the
written text and the visual: sometimes the written text introduces
the characters or actions represented on the next page, for
example, on pages 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, and 26.
However, there are cases where the visual action is offered
first and then the written text is found after, explaining
the action already offered visually. There are examples of such
pattern on pages 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, and 29.
