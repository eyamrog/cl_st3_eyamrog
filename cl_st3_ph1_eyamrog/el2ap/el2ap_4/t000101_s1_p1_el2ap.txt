From a normative perspective, policy change is seen as crucial
to improving social conditions, reducing inequality, and promoting sustainability. However,
what about change that implies the dismantling of previously successful
policies? How can one differentiate between democratic policy change and
policy dismantling? In order to shed light on these questions,
this article analyzes changes occurred in Brazil since Jair Bolsonaro
took office in January 2019. The paper addresses those changes
from the perspective of the federal bureaucracy spread across different
agencies and professional careers. The research design involved quantitative and
qualitative data collected using the following methods: i) a survey
with former and current federal employees; ii) semi-­‐structured interviews with
civil servants who have worked or are still working in
the federal government. Research findings indicate that, in Brazil, policy
dismantling is no ordinary policy change, as it has been
marked by authoritarian dynamics that have disarranged the federal bureaucracy
and eroded state capacity.
