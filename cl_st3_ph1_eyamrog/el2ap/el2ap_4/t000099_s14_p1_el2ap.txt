Seeds of Acanthostachys strobilacea (Schult. & Schult.f.) Klotzsch were harvested
at the Reserva Biológica de Mogi Guaçu in São Paulo
State, Brazil, and stored under 8°C for approximately 12 months
prior to the experiments. NS were obtained as described by
Santos et al. (2010). The seeds were surface sterilized in
100% (v/v) commercial sodium hypochlorite (2% of active chlorine) containing
0.1% (v/v) Tween 20® for 20 min and then transferred
to 25% (v/v) of hydrochloric acid for 10 min to
remove a large part of the mucilage. Seeds were immersed
in 70% (v/v) ethanol for 5 min, in the fungicide
Benomyl 0.1% (w/v) for an additional 15 min, and in
100% (v/v) commercial sodium hypochlorite containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20®
for 1 h (Santos et al. 2010). The seeds were
transferred aseptically to 250 mL flasks containing 40 mL of
Murashige & Skoog (1962) medium (MS) with 1/5 of the
original macronutrient concentration (MS/5), 100% of MS micronutrients, sucrose 2%
(w/v), 100 mg L-1 of myo-inositol, and 0.1 mg L-1
of thiamine. The pH was adjusted to 5.8, and agar
(5 g L¹) was added before autoclaving for 15 min
at 121°C. The seeds were kept in a growth room
at 25±2°C, 12-h photoperiod and 14 μmol m-2 s-1 to
induce elongation of the stem axis of the plants (Santos
et al. 2010). After three months, NS were isolated from
the elongated plants (figure 1a) and transferred aseptically to flasks
containing 20 mL of the same culture media described previously,
closed with caps containing a 2-mm hole covered by a
rubber septum for the harvesting of air samples (Lamarca &
Barbedo 2012). The same was performed for a batch of
surface-sterilized seeds. Flasks were kept in a growth room under
12-h photoperiod, 25±2 °C and 30 μmol m-2 s-1 irradiance.
Plant growth evaluation and air samples were analysed during the
light period from five flasks containing five propagules each at
0, 7, 14, 21 and 35 days.
