São Paulo occupies the second position in monthly household income
per capita and Rio de Janeiro the fourth position, with
a monthly income of R$ 1,814 and R$ 1,723, respectively.
The proportion of the population over 16 years of age
employed in the first quarter of 2021 was 67.1% in
the state of São Paulo and 63.6% in Rio de
Janeiro7. Thus, economic differences exist but they are small to
explain the large differences in mortality. Also, the proportion of
the population registered in the Cadastro Único, available to families
with monthly income lower or equal to ½ minimum wage
was 12.2% in the city of São Paulo compared to
8,9% in the city of Rio de Janeiro8. With the
exception that the records do not portray the total vulnerability
of families, it appears that São Paulo is not less
vulnerable than Rio de Janeiro. The vulnerability has been shown
to affect COVID-19 mortality. In Belo Horizonte, a metropolitan city
also in the Southeast of Brazil, the overall mortality per
100,000 older adults (60+ years) was 292, increasing from 179
to 354 and 476, in low, intermediate, and high vulnerability
areas, respectively 9.
