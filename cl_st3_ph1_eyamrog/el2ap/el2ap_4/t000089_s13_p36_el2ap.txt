On the extreme side of that option, is Stanley Hauerwas’s
theological appropriation of a communitarian theory of virtue ethics. Coming
himself from a protestant tradition, Hauerwas raises severe criticism of
Christian movements that seek an alliance between the Church and
the state. Drawing on the work of John Howard Yoder,
Hauerwas sees any attempt at controlling the political realm in
the name of religion with scepticism, as he believes that
the needs of the state, in terms of effectiveness and
security, are often incompatible with the required virtues of faith.
In particular, he believes that once Christians are in power,
they would need to change moral discourses in order to
make concessions for those who are not formal members of
the Church. As he notes: “servanthood and love of enemy,
contentment and monogamy, cannot be expected of everyone. So, a
duality develops in ethics between ‘evangelical counsels’ for the motivated
and ‘precepts’ for everyone else” (Hauerwas, 1988, p. 122). Moreover,
Hauerwas is especially concerned that in the impetus for saving
secular governments, Christians may have to choose between the gospel’s
orientation for self-sacrifice and the nation’s call for war. For
this reason, he opposes state sponsored religious activities, contending that
it is not the task of religious citizens to try
to get access to political power in order to change
the ethos of society. Rather, they should concentrate their efforts
on developing the virtues necessary for the realisation of their
communitarian goals in the Church.
