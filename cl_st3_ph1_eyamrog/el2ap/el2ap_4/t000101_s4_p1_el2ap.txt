This research sought to contribute to the literature on policy
dismantling in contexts of illiberal populism. In the case of
Brazil during the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro, policy dismantling is
not simply an expected form of policy change that results
from the democratic process. Instead, Brazil presents a kind of
authoritarian policy dismantling, in which federal workers are subject to
an overall process of intimidation and fear, of institutional dismantling,
and of decision-­‐ making paralysis. A good number of them
respond by opting to exit their positions, their agencies, the
federal government, and even the country. Without experienced civil servants,
especially those who had spent time working with the implementation
of needed policies, further policy dismantling occurs.
