As shown in the state graph in Figure 4, all
HMM have four states. Each state represents a different type
of location or activity, namely: Home (C), Work (T), Leisure
(E) and Others (O). In turn, each HMM has its
own transition matrix 𝐴ℎ,𝑒,𝑙, which presents state change probabilities 𝑎ℎ,𝑒,𝑙(𝑖,
𝑗), that is, to move from a type of location
(j) to another (i); a matrix 𝐵ℎ,𝑒,𝑙 that shows output
probabilities 𝑏ℎ,𝑒,𝑙(𝑘, 𝑖) for each state (for the k possible
places where Ha in the state i could go to)
and a vector 𝜋 of initial location probabilities. Vector 𝜋
is always (1,0,0,0) for the beginning of the day, as
it is assumed that all citizens start the day at
home.
