As interactions via WhatsApp are instant and allow on-demand response,
teaching presence was manifested not only by the teachers, but
also by course participants who were available and who felt
comfortable contributing. During the course, the Mobile Phone emoji was
used every time the teachers and tutors interacted with the
group. This was a strategy to help course participants identify
the teachersâ€™ post, tasks, or interventions to build understanding of
a type of digital genre. As this emoji served as
a pedagogical strategy and did not emerge from the interactions
in the course, it was not coded as teaching presence
and not analyzed as such.
