The cultivation of plants under sealed flasks could lead to
restriction of gas exchange between the internal and external environment,
causing an accumulation of gases such as CO2 and O2
inside the flasks (George et al. 2008). Thus, the gaseous
composition of the isolated in vitro atmosphere reflects the respiratory
and photosynthetic activities of micropropagated plants (Chen 2006). When plants
are cultivated under photomixotrophic conditions, defined by the use of
high sugar concentration in the culture medium, low irradiance, high
relative humidity and reduced gas exchange due to enclosed vessels,
the rate of photosynthesis is diminished while respiration is less
affected due to the carbon supply (Lucchesini et al. 2001,
George et al. 2008, Ševčíková et al. 2019).
