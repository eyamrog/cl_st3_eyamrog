A look at the Indicators showed that they are very
objective, with clear definitions and based on numbers with pre-defined
rules. It is also visible the importance of reliable data
coming from the Institutions, which is shown by the fact
that there are 22 Indicators obtained from questionnaires (61.11%) and
only 14 Indicators (38.89%) obtained from open sources.
