In addition, ecological indices were calculated to assess the responses
to environmental variations presented by the macroinvertebrate community, using the
PrimerÂ® 6.0 software, such as specific richness, evenness and Shannon-Wiener
diversity (BORJA et al., 2000; BORJA; MUXIKA:, 2005). The ecological
indices were also compared using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). To
assess the community structure, cluster analysis was performed with the
objects and descriptors, using Simpson's index and comparison by paired
groups.
