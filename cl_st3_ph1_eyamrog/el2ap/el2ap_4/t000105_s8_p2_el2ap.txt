In Brazil, the federal government's neglect and mismanagement in articulation
of actions to pandemic control has led many municipalities to
make important epidemiological surveillance decisions, in isolation, to avoid the
spread of the virus in their territories. In this context,
the difficulties inherent in the diagnosis and notification process, scarcity
of human resources in the health services and epidemiological surveillance
sectors, and lack of diagnostic tests have made it extremely
difficult to understand the actual situation with respect to the
frequency of both the disease and the infection [4-7].
