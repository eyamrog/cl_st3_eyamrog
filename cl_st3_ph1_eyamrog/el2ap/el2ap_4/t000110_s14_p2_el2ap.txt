During the dry season of 2014, the cores were collected
by divers from a deep zone of both sites. The
location was selected based on the water depth profile coupled
with riverbed sediment sampling. Divers collected a 122 cm core
(XC1-02) from the Arapujá island, and a 362 cm core
(XC-03) from the Ria, using a 6 m long PVC
tube sectioned at 2 cm intervals. Core chronology was determined
by Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) and 14C dating. Two samples
for quartz OSL dating were collected and prepared in the
Luminescence and Gamma Spectrometry Laboratory of the Instituto de Geociências
at the Universidade de São Paulo. Four samples were collected
and prepared for 14C dating at the Analytic Radiocarbon Dating
in Miami and the Radiocarbon Laboratory at the Universidade Federal
Fluminense (LAC-UFF). For more details, see Sawakuchi et al. (2015).
Based on the OSL and 14C dating, the base of
the XC1-02 and XC-03 cores corresponded to about ~6.000 cal
yr BP and 4.000 cal yr. BP, respectively, which covers
the end of Mid-Holocene and the Late Holocene.
