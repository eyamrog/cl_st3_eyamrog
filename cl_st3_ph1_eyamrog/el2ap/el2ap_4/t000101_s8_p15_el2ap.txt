Bauer & Becker (2020) look at various examples of how
populist backsliders have dealt with public administration. They look at
the examples of Hungary, Peru, the United States and Switzerland,
where they identify the following takes on the public bureaucracy:
capture, dismantling, sabotage, and reform. Their work includes a matrix
that crosstabs the populistâ€™s view of the state (positive or
negative) with the administrative order in the country (fragile or
robust). When the populist holds a negative view of a
state that carries a fragile administrative order, dismantling ensues. The
authors find this to be the case of Peru under
Fujimori. This article will present data indicating that this is
also the case of Brazil under Bolsonaro, along the lines
of what Sabourin et al. (2020) found in their study
of family farming policies.
