This picturebook has been chosen for two reasons: 1) it
has a simple plot because it narrates the different things
that a child called Emily does with her two fathers
— in this sense, the actions narrated in the book
are not specific to gay families — 2) the book
shows a symmetrical representation of the fathers, which suggests that
both have equal importance. The child refers to the actions
that she does with each father in the book.
