Data are presented for frequency measures of HRV: low-frequency power
(LF), and high-frequency power (HF) in both ms2 and normalized
units and the ratio of LF power to HF power
(LF:HF). The normalized (or normalized unit) spectral indices are defined
as LFnu = LF / (LF + HF) and HFnu
= HF / (LF + HF).
