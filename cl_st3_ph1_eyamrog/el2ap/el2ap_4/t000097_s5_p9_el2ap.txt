Regarding the instruments used, it is noteworthy that there is
a wide range of possibilities, which makes later comparisons between
studies difficult. Regarding quality of life, for example, which was
shown to be the main outcome in most study protocols,
the instruments used included the European Organization for Research and
Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC
QLQ-C30), EuroQol Five- dimensional Instrument (EQ-5D-5L), and the Functional Assessment
of Cancer Therapy - Breast (FACT-B). All of them are
validated and used in studies on cancer patients. The Hospital
Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is one of the most
used instruments to assess depression and anxiety.
