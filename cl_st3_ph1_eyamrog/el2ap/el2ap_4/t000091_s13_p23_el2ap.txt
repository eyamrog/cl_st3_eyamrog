The option to use valerian, as an alternative to benzodiazepines,
was based on the report of its anxiolytic and sedative
properties, already demonstrated in clinical and experimental studies. In addition,
also based on data from the literature, this phytotherapeutic agent
seems to be practically free of side effects, having good
acceptance by patients under medical care (Hadley & Petry, 2003;
Pinheiro et al., 2014; Gharib et al., 2015).
