Finally, the dog, Max, is the written theme in the
three cases (4,68%) that refer to him as ‘Max’ and
‘he’ (twice). This coincides with his visual representation as theme,
because he is foregrounded on the right-hand corner of page
24. The thematization of the dog is a way of
giving him importance. He is also foregrounded by being represented
in front of Emily the first time that all the
characters are together.
