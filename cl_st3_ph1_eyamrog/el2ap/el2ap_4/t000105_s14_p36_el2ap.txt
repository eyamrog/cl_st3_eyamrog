According to the manufacturer’s validation data, the sensitivity of the
One Step COVID- 2019 Test (Wondfo®) was 86.43% (95% CI:
82.58%–89.58%) and the specificity was 99.57% (95% CI: 97.92%–99.92%). It
is important to note that the negative results did not
exclude a SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the positive results cannot be
used as absolute evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV-2. These
results only indicate a previous exposure to the infectious agent
[19].
