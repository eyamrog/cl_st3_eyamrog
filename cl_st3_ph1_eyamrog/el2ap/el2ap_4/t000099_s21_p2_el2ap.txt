NS showed shoot multiplication after two weeks of culture (table
1, figures 1b and c), which was not present in
seeds (table 1, figures 1d and 2e). However, seedlings had
higher leaf elongation, more and longer roots than NS plants
by 35 days of culture (figure 2). The more intense
root and leaf growth in seedlings might be the result
of reserve mobilization from the seed, which provides nutrients for
the plant until it is nutritionally independent (Taiz et al.
2017). Meanwhile, shoot multiplication in NS may be due to
multiple bud breaks induced by apical dominance release after node
excision from the mother plant (George et al. 2008).
