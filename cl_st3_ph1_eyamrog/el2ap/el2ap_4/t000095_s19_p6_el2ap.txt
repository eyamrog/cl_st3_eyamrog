One possible explanation for the Rio/São Paulo disparity in mortality
would be differences in available beds for Covid. Concerning hospital
beds (per 100 000 population), São Paulo shows a better
scenario compared to Rio de Janeiro (27.8 and 23.3, respectively)3.
However, in the period evaluated, the lag in time between
diagnostic and hospitalization was similar for Rio and São Paulo,
around 5 days (5.8 and 5.9, respectively).
