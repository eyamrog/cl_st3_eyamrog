Assuming that virus transmission in streets is practically negligible and
that, therefore, it has no impact on the model, it
is postulated that, for Ha, mobility on foot from one
plot to another is immediate. As described in the previous
section, only dynamics of mobility by public transportation are represented,
where appropriate, since this type of mobility is considered as
a possible activity for the state Others, which will be
discussed below.
