Another finding that is important to point out – and
which came as a by-product of our searches on the
Domínio Público, BDTD, CAPES websites – is that translation, validation,
and cultural adaptation of medical questionnaires is also a popular
line of research. However, these studies have been mostly conducted
by health science scholars, rather than translation studies researchers. This
finding emphasizes the existing interdisciplinarity between applied linguistics and health
sciences, that could be furthered by translation studies. To this
end, we collected quantitative data in this regard and plan
to conduct future studies on the role of translators in
the composition of teams that develop/translate medical questionnaires.
