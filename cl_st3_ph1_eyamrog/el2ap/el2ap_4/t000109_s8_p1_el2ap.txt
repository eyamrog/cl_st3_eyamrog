In March 2020, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that produced the
COVID-19 outbreak infected more than 270,000 people all over the
world and killed more than 11,300 [1]. The epidemiological analysis
of the different outbreaks of this disease, which have been
recorded worldwide, has helped develop different models, mainly mathematical, to
track and anticipate the spread of epidemics [2][3][4][5]. It is
within this context that the present work arises, with the
aim to provide an alternative that allows including more factors
of reality and to predict the impact of different social
and health policies.
