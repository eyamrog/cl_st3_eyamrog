The O2 consumption and CO2 release rates progressively decreased in
NS and seeds after peaking at 7 and 14 days,
respectively, reaching similar values by 35 days (figure 3). This
decrease in respiration rate might have derived from an ongoing
increase in photosynthetic activity due to the development of leaves
and multiple shoots in seeds and NS, respectively, and due
to depletion of the carbon source of the media. Overall,
in vitro plants cultivated under photomixotrophic conditions as in the
present study show photosynthetic activity, although at lower rates than
respiration (Ševčíková et al. 2019). It has been reported that
protocorm-like bodies of the Cymbidium Melody Fair 'Marilyn Monroe' orchid
showed an increase in photosynthetic rates concomitant to decreases in
respiration between 20 and 60 days of in vitro culture
in MS medium containing 2% sucrose (Ogasawara et al. 1995).
Studies also indicate that an increase in photosynthesis can lead
to higher cytosolic ATP/ADP rates, inhibiting respiration (Krömer 1995; Buchanan
et al. 2015). The decrease in O2 consumption observed herein
may also reflect the cellular energy demand, which was possibly
lower after seedling establishment and full morphogenesis in NS plants
- both highly energetic processes (Yaseen et al. 2012, Taiz
et al. 2017). Finally, the occurrence of some photosynthetic capacity
observed in seed and NS plants by 35 days would
possibly facilitate ex vitro acclimatization at that period (Ševčíková et
al. 2019). Indeed, our research group observed a 100% survival
rate after transplanting one-month-old A. strobilacea seedlings (De Carvalho et
al. 2014) and NS plants (unpublished data) to Pinus bark
substrate, under the same environmental conditions described.
