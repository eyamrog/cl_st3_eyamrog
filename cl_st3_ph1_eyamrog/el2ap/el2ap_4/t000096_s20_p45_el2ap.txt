In this sense, as part of the ICT that support
the training processes, there are the Content Management Systems (CMS)
for learning, which can be used in the virtual mode,
however, they are also considered a support for face-to-face as
a complement to the activities that the teacher plans, for
which they become allies to organize and structure a subject
(García-Valcárcel 2009). In this way, it is necessary for teachers
to have the necessary skills to take advantage of the
potential of ICT to generate different cognitive effects and in
turn, improve the attitude, imagination and creativity of the student
during the teaching-learning process (De la Torre 2010).
