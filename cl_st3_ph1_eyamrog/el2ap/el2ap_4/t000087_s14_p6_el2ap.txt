Extracted RNA isolated with the TRIzol protocol (TRIzolTM Reagent, no
date; Rio et al., 2010) from a sample of a
SARS-CoV-2 fully vaccinated symptomatic positive patient, with a Ct value
of 22.53 using the RIDAGENE SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR MULTIPLEX kit (R-BIOPHARM
AG), was used to prepare an Illumina library using the
Artic v3 protocol as described in (Pipelines R&D et al.,
2020). The SARS-CoV-2 amplicons library was prepared and sequenced at
the “Unidad Universitaria de Secuenciación Masiva y Bioinformatica - UNAM”
using the Illumina NextSeq500 platform with a 300 cycle kit
with a pair end configuration to obtain reads with a
150 base pair length.
