Throughout the posts, social presence led participants to feel comfortable
playing the role of teacher, something quite positive in a
social environment such as WhatsApp, in which the dynamicity and
the number of messages often call for a participant available
at any time to step up, as can be seen
in the excerpts above. Structuring and facilitating class management and
instruction shows that social presence plays an important role supporting
teaching presence.
