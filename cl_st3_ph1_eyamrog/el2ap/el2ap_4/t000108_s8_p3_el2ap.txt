Among the most representative botanical families of the Atlantic Domain,
the Melastomataceae stands out, with a total of 510 taxa
(Flora do Brasil 2020). Pleroma D. Don is a genus
of Melastomataceae with about 160 species with Neotropical distribution, found
mainly in areas of Atlantic Forest and Cerrado domains, rarely
in the Caatinga (Guimarães et al. 2019). Only five species
reach the northwest and west of South America (Freitas et
al. 2013; Fraga and Guimarães 2014, Oliveira et al. 2014,
Guimarães et al. 2019). The group was traditionally treated as
a synonym with of genus Tibouchina Aublet sensu Cogniaux (1885,
1891). Tibouchina was fragmented into four well-supported genera by morphological,
molecular and geographic distribution characteristics (Michelangeli et al. 2013, Guimarães
et al. 2019), being Tibouchina s.s., limited to only 35
taxa with distribution restricted to Cerrado environments (Silva et al.
2014, Guimarães 2014, Guimarães et al. 2019). The Tibouchina species
found in eastern Brazil was transferred to two distinct groups,
Pleroma and Chaetogastra DC. (Guimarães et al. 2019).
