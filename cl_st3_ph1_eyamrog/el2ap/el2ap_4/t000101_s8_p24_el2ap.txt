Different from the Peru example of dismantling provided by Bauer
and Becker (2020), in which a populist’s negative view of
the state meets a weak administrative order, Bolsonaro met an
administrative order that was strong and well-­‐established. On the one
hand, like Fujimori, he set the country on a course
for neoliberal administrative reforms under the guidance of his Minister
of the Economy, Paulo Guedes. But beyond pleasing the market,
Bolsonaro also adopted an ideological agenda that collided with much
of what the Brazilian state had been doing when it
came to public policies: environmental protection, social inclusion, racial and
gender equality, and science-­‐based public health. Such route of collision
produced authoritarian acts and processes, meant to frighten, intimidate, and
alienate the bureaucracy.
