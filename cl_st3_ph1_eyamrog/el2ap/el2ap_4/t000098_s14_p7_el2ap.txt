Recognizing beforehand the impossibility of obtaining this information from a
single source and, therefore, the size of the data collection
work, our initial goal was to cover countries that, together,
accounted for 90% of Covid-19 deaths. Of the 34 countries
required to achieve this goal, minimally updated age-disaggregated data for
six countries could not be found: Russia, Iran, Belgium, Romania,
Iraq, and Bolivia. The other 28 countries for which the
searches were successful accounted for 82% of deaths by 1/28/2021.
