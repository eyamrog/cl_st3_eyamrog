24.4% reported secondary infections of close contacts. None of the
adolescents in this study nor their positive close contacts resulted
in severe cases, needed hospitalization or died of COVID- 19.
The results of this study are in line with other
studies that show that COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective for
preventing hospitalization and death (Mlcochova et al., 2021; Sheikh et
al., 2021). Vaccinated adolescents can develop mild or moderate symptoms
when infected with SARS-CoV-2 and overall, they have less risk
of severe disease or death due to COVID-19 than older
individuals.
