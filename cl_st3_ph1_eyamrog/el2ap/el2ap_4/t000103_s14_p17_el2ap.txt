In the appendix of this paper, all sentences in the
three languages are presented. In the next section, results are
presented and discussed. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software
(version 26). The small size of the dataset means that
it is not possible to generalize conclusions. However, it contributes
to test the syntactic and semantic hypothesis in the languages.
