Our findings of greater lethality for Covid-19 among hospitalized patients
in Rio de Janeiro compared to São Paulo, both at
the capital and interior of the states, is in line
with findings of mortality for 100,000 inhabitants of the Epidemiological
Monitor of the Ministry of Health1. Also, a recent study
using data from the SIVEP-Gripe from March 2020 to January
2021 drew attention to the fact of the age-standardized mortality
by Covid-19 in Rio de Janeiro was 56% higher if
compared to São Paulo2. In this study, the authors showed
that the SIVEP-Gripe is a reliable source of mortality by
Covid-19 and that the specific mortality coefficients by all age
groups are higher in Rio de Janeiro in contrast to
those from São Paulo.
