This pragmatist viewpoint underestimates the role of truth in directing
the dialogical process, encapsulating social groups in their particular worldviews
and precluding the expansion of cultural horizons. Moreover, by redirecting
the moral significance of religious meanings to immanent realities, which
no longer refer to the metaphysical realm, this perspective fails
to take account of possible solutions to fundamental normative disagreements.
Importantly, the conception of truth that I am proposing is
based on Jürgen Habermas’s (2003) account of communicative rationality. According
to this theory, democratic consensuses are constituted by moral claims
which are analogous to the truth, to the extent that
individuals can assess their validity in terms of a view
of universal justice3. While democratic deliberation is always open- ended,
individuals cannot avoid giving a “yes”or “no” position to divergent
truth and moral claims that may disrupt the agent’s worldview.
