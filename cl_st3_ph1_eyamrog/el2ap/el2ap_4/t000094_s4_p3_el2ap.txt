The picturebook analysed contributes to promoting two-father families. In this
sense, it helps empower students with this family pattern. In
addition, the content of this book invites students, who belong
to traditional families, to respect and be open to different
types of families, so that a cultural and social change
can take place. In fact, traditional family models are challenged
and new ways of structuring a family become more common.
The children who read this book will have opportunities to
acquire values related to equality and promotion of rights for
people, no matter what sexual orientation they have. Consequently, this
picturebook makes the curriculum inclusive for all children, especially those
that fear that people will not understand their types of
family.
