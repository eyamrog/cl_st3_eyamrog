The objective of the website www.dominiopublico.gov.br is to promote broad
access to literary, artistic, and scientific works that are in
the public domain or have had their publication duly authorized.
Its home page features a basic search form that offers
the user filters for different types of media (image, sound,
text, and video). Other home page filters include category, author,
title, and language. In addition to the basic search section,
there is a specific section for dissertations and theses, which
was used for our initial search. In this section, we
first selected the filter mestrado (master) in the window Nível
(level) and wrote Tradução (translation) in the window Palavras-Chave (keywords)
(see Figure 1).
