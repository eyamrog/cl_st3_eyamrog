Finally, to determine how gender affects the use of emojis,
four independent samples t tests were conducted with gender as
the IV and emoji use for each type of presence
as the DV. Of the 61 survey participants, 39 were
females and 21 were males, and one participant did not
specify. In terms of cognitive presence, female participants (M =
10.13, SD = 14.30) used emojis to represent cognitive presence
slightly more than male participants (M = 8.00, SD =
8.38), though not significantly, t(58) = .63, p = .53
(see Tables 8 and 9).
