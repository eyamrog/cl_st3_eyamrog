After making this list of Institutions, the correlations among all
pairs of Indicators of the same Dimension are calculated and
analyzed. In the same way, the correlations among the averages
of each Dimension are made. The reason to do those
correlations is to study how correlated are the Dimensions and
Indicators, to understand the level of independence of the Indicators
and Dimensions. Some of them are expected to have high
correlations. As examples, we can mention the absolute number of
publications, the normalized number of publications and the number of
“top cited” publications. It is expected that institutions that have
high numbers in one of these Indicators may have high
numbers in all of them. It is important to see
those correlations, because they give an indication if we are
really measuring 5 Dimensions and 36 Indicators, or if some
of them are just different forms to measure the same
aspect under a different question.
