To determine how age relates to emoji use, four Spearman
Rho analyses were conducted. The ages of the participants ranged
from 21 years of age to 60 years of age,
with a mean age of 38 years. The results of
the analyses revealed no significant correlations for age as it
relates to cognitive presence (rs = -.07, p = .62),
teaching presence (rs = .10, p = .44), social presence
(rs = .04, p = .74), or total presence (rs
= -.002, p = .99; see Table 7). In a
study by Fullwood, Orchard, and Floyd (2013) on emoji use
in internet chat rooms, no significant differences existed across age
groups in terms of emoji use. Similarly, Alshenqeeti (2016) suggested
that age was not as strong of a predictor of
emoji use compared to technological awareness and capability. Therefore, the
findings of the current study align with other studies on
age and emoji use.
