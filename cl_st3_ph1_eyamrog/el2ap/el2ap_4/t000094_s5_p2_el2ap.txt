The story is narrated from Emily’s perspective: the pronoun ‘I’
referring to her is the most common type of theme.
In addition, Emily is reinforced in the visual theme because
she is represented foregrounded, at the right of the page
or in central position. However, there is no simple visual
where she is represented alone, which suggests that the purpose
of the plot is to describe the different activities that
she does with her fathers. The general tendency is to
represent characters showing their whole bodies, i.e., they are full-length
figures whose size is medium, and they are represented occupying
a considerable part of the page.
