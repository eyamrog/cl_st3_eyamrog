All participants were given a 10-question presurvey prior to beginning
the course. The presurvey consisted of four demographic questions (i.e.,
name, location, age, gender) and six 5-point Likert scale questions
on participants’ attitudes towards the use of mobile devices for
teaching and learning. Upon completion of the 8-week course, participants
were given a post survey consisting of three questions on
their readiness to use and apply mobile devices for teaching
and learning. The pre and post survey questions were selected
from the Mobile Learning Survey, originally adapted by Gunter and
Reeves (2017) to examine teachers’ attitudes towards online professional development
embedded with mobile learning. Internal consistency reliability for the attitude
questions were acceptable (r = .70 for presurvey items and
r = .77 for post survey items (Gunter & Reeves,
2017).
