The "U-Multirank" (https://www.umultirank.org/; PRADO 2021a and 2021b) was created based
on this idea. It evaluates the performance of educational institutions
in five Dimensions: (1) Teaching and Learning, (2) Research, (3)
Knowledge Transfer, (4) International Orientation and (5) Regional Engagement. Each
of these Dimensions is divided into a large number of
Indicators, going from four to eleven, depending on the Dimension.
It is focused in future students who want to see
an international classification of higher education institutions to choose the
one that most closely matches their interests. The user can
evaluate each Indicator, separately or grouped in families, focusing in
the most important ones for a given decision to be
made.
