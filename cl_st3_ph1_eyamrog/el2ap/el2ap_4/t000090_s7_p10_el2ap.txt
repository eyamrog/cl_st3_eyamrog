Regarding Dimensions, the present paper looks for the statistical correlations
among all Dimensions, to see if the Institutions have homogeneous
performances in the different Dimensions or are more focused in
some of them. For example, we will see if the
best performers in “Teaching and Learning” are also the best
performers in “Research”, or any other Dimension. It is also
interesting to see the correlations among Dimensions, because the traditional
evaluation made by CAPES is focused in the Dimension “Research”,
so it is interesting to see how this Dimension is
usually related with others in multidimensional rankings.
