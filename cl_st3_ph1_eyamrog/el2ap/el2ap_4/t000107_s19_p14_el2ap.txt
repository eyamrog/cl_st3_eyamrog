The final collection of theses and dissertations titles completed in
higher education institutions in Brazil is given in Table 5.
Such collection is a valuable source of data for other
researchers interested in translation studies in the country, especially those
interested in the translation of medical texts. It is also
a reliable source for the analysis of the most investigated
topics, which may reveal possible gaps in medical translation studies.
