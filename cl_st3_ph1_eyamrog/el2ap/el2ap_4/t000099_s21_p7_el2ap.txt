Finally, considering the involvement of mitochondrial ROS production and carbohydrate
mobilization in seed germination and bud outgrowth (Considine & Foyer
2014, Taiz et al. 2017, Signorelli et al. 2018), it
may be valuable to investigate the effects of redox status
and carbohydrate composition during shoot generation from seeds and NS
of A. strobilacea to provide more insight on the developmental
discrepancies between them.
