To solve all the issues described above we adapted and
expanded Alves and Vasconcellos (2016) methodology. More specifically, we conducted
searches on the websites Domínio Público, BDTD and CAPES using
not only keywords, but also strings of keywords, a variety
of filters, and author’s names searches. These measures helped us
both verify all the information retrieved and streamline the results,
to avoid duplicating/missing information.
