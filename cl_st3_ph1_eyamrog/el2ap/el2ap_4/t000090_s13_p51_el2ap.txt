The results show that there are no “very strong” or
“strong” correlations among the Indicators of this Dimension. There are
only two “moderate” correlations. Therefore, the Indicators of this Dimension
are very independent from each other. The average of the
magnitude of all the Indicators of this Dimension is 0.2451,
and the standard deviation is 0.1278, so the results validate
this Dimension for the group of Institutions studied here.
