The results show that there is no “very strong” correlation,
but there are two “strong” correlations. The first one is
among the Indicators “Patents awarded (absolute numbers)” and “Patents awarded
(size-normalized)”. They have a correlation index of 0.8077. It means
that the Institutions that are good at delivering new products
have good grades in both Indicators. Those Indicators have a
high degree of redundancy.
