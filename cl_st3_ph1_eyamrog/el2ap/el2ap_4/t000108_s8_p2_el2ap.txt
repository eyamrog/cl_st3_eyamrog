This mountain chain consists of a mosaic of environments of
grassland and forest vegetation with high biological diversity and great
occurrence of endemisms, a condition normally registered in tropical montane
environments (Martinelli 2007, Salimena et al. 2013). The Serra Negra
region, in the southern Minas Gerais, between the municipalities of
Lima Duarte, Rio Preto, Santa Bárbara do Monte Verde and
Olaria, is composed of vegetation characterized by forests and grassland,
especially cloud forests and “campos rupestres” (rocky grasslands), occurring at
altitudes between 1.300 to 1.700 m (Salimena et al. 2013).
In addition, the region is notable for integrating the southeastern
corridor of the Mantiqueira Complex, which is formed by remnants
of primary vegetation with a high degree of connectivity between
them (Salimena et al. 2013).
