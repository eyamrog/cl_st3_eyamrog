Studies show the environmental impact generated by tourism in rivers
inserted in protected areas, such as the Formoso River, located
in the Formoso River Ecological Park, in Bonito, and the
Prata River, present in the Private Reserve of Natural Heritage
(RPPN) Fazenda Cabeceira do Prata (ESCARPINATI et al., 2011; COELHO
et al., 2011), both in the state of Mato Grosso
do Sul (MS), central-west region of Brazil, and important touristic
destinations.
