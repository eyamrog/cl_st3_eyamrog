According to King and Lewis (2018, p. 1), in simple
terms anaphora could be defined as “the phenomenon whereby the
interpretation of an occurrence [the anaphor] of one expression depends
on the interpretation of an occurrence of another [the antecedent]”.
The anaphor and its antecedent can be in the same
or different sentences, and the anaphor can appear before or
after its antecedent in the discourse. If the anaphor comes
after its antecedent, there is an example of forward anaphora
or just anaphora; see example (1)1. Otherwise, there is an
example of backwards anaphora or cataphora (2). In this study,
we will use the term anaphora to talk about both,
anaphora and cataphora, when it is not relevant to differentiate
them.
