On the other hand, each Ha has a particular behavior
according to its age range, habits and neighborhood where it
lives, randomly assigned at the beginning of each simulation, following
the population statistics for the city. Considering this, each Ha
moves individually according to probabilities (𝐴 𝜖 𝜆ℎ,𝑒,𝑙(𝐴, 𝐵, 𝜋))
associated with state change matrices (activities/locations) of a set 𝜆ℎ,𝑒,𝑙
of HMM that represent the Mobility/Activity submodel. Each HMM corresponds
to a place (l) (neighborhood/city/area) where Ha lives, to its
age range (e) , and to the time slot (h)
it is in at the time of the simulation. The
description of this submodel will be resumed in Section 4.3.
Finally, the permanence of active virus in different locations/environments is
represented by the Infectious trail submodel described in Section 4.3.1.
