Up to this point, page 20 is the only case
of Daddy represented in the visual doing an action with
Emily: he is in the background fishing with Emily. Then,
on the next page, it is Dad who is sitting
on a bench with Max observing how they fish. The
written text is at the bottom of the page, in
the foreground, right after the stream that is also on
the previous page.
