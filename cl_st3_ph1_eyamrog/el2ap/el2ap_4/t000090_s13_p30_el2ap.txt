The best “300 performers” in Europe in the 2020 edition
of the “U-Multirank” were used for this study. The choice
of this sample is not only made by the fact
that they have more complete data set, as already explained,
but they also have the advantage of belonging to the
same continent, which can reduce effects coming from too different
cultures and other particularities, leaving the main focus on the
Indicators and Dimensions used by the ranking.
