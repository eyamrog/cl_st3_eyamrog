All the actions in the story take place inside, pages
7, 8, 9, 14, 15, and 26 to 29, and
outside the house (right outside the house, pages 10 and
11; in the park, pages 16 and 17; in the
stream, pages 20 and 21; in the countryside, pages 22
to 25). It is interesting that the kettle appears on
more than one page, pages 9 and 12, as a
way to show that the action takes place at home,
and the place of the house where most of the
actions take place is the sitting room, pages 6, 7,
14, 15, 18, and 19.
