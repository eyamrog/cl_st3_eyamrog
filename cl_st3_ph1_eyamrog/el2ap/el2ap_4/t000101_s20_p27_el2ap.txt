“My view, which proved to be wrong, was that the
Bolsonaro government would slam the door and chop off heads
right away. This did not happen, my forecast was wrong.
In fact, they did the opposite, they slowly controlled the
state machinery, it was a gradual and slow process which
resulted in the fact that, nowadays, I do not have
a single colleague who occupies a political appointment position in
this government. They were removed, one by one, from where
they were, because of the positions they had occupied in
previous governments. (…) There are military officers at the Cabinet
for Institutional Security (GSI) who investigate people’s social network accounts.
If anyone says anything that seems left-­‐leaning, they do not
approve their appointments” (interview 04).
