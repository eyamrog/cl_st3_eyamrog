In this context, the Normative Ordinance 144/2010 of Fundação Florestal
establishes the daily limit of visitors at Cachoeira do Paraíso
waterfall, which is currently 180 for independent visitors and 90
for organized groups. This restriction was imposed to reduce potential
impacts on the preserved area and guarantee the public use
of the waterfall as an instrument of environmental education. The
presence of restaurants in the vicinity of the visitor center
(MAGINI; ABESSA:, 2017), despite contributing as a source of income
for the local population, can also generate impacts, such as
water pollution due to incorrect waste disposal, in addition to
increase the river silting up, which leads to potential impacts
to the biota.
