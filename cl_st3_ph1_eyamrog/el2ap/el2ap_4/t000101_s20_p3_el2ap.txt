When President Rousseff was impeached in 2016 and replaced by
her Vice-­‐President Michel Temer, it was common to hear among
the federal bureaucracy that they would resist policy dismantling8. In
fact some did, possibly with the help of a broader
political context that limited Temer’s reach. Having become President under
questionable circumstances, Temer focused his 2.5 years in government on
two main agendas: Labor Reform and Pension Reform. He succeeded
in the former and failed in the latter. Everything else
was not central to Temer’s commitment to the economic powers
that rose him to office. The bureaucracy could, in some
sectors, continue policy as usual. In human rights, for instance,
Temer appointed a highly respected scholar, Flavia Piovesan. She was
able, among other achievements, to raise the institutional status of
the department of LGBTQ rights at the Ministry of Human
Rights. In foreign policy, Temer sustained his predecessor’s foreign policy
stances, committed to join the OECD, and even sustained previous
levels of South-­‐South cooperation projects (Marcondes & Mawdsley, 2017), as
a result of what I have called ‘bureaucratic momentum’ (Morais
de Sa e Silva, forthcoming).
