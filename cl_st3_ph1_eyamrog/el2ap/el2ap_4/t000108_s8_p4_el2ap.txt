The taxa inserted in Pleroma are characterized by the deciduous
sepals in the fruits, hypanthium without scale-like trichomes, stamens with
anthers from purple to lilac (rarely cream or white), pedoconnective
well developed below the thecae and filaments usually covered by
setose or glandular trichomes. They occur in diverse environments, found
from forest areas, fields of altitudes and rock fields, to
shrub-tree restinga formations (Fraga and Guimarães 2014, Guimarães and Freitas
2015). In the floristic survey carried out in Serra Negra
we found three species of Chaetogastra and ten species of
Pleroma (Justino 2016), one of which is a new species
described here.
