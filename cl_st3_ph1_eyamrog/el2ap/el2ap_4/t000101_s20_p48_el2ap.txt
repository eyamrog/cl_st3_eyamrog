The testimonies given by several participants, as reflected in the
quotes above, coincide with the high number of cases of
harassment reported by ARCA, the National Association of Public Careers
for Development. Up to 22 July 2021, 867 cases of
harassment in the Bolsonaro administration had been reported by federal
civil servants to ARCAâ€™s online platform.13 This oppressive setting and
the way it pushes civil servants to exit their positions,
to censor their own ideas and to make their professional
work invisible, constitute a process of no ordinary policy change,
but rather of policy dismantling that assumes authoritarian features.
