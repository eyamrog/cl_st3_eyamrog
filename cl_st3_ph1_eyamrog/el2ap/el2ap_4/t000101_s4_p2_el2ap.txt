It is hoped that the paper will add to the
experimental findings presented by Guedes-­‐ Neto & Peters (2021). If,
on the one hand, civil servants are inclined to shirk
from undemocratic projects, when put under authoritarian pressure they may
be less able or willing to do so. There may
be less shirking and sabotage when the bureaucracy is too
afraid or when exit, in its various forms, is an
available option.
