Aslanargun et al. (2012) investigated the effect of pre-operative oral
administration of Passiflora incarnata Linneaus on anxiety, psychomotor functions, sedation,
and hemodynamics in patients undergoing spinal anesthesia. They concluded that
the pre-operative oral administration of Passiflora incarnata Linneaus suppresses the
increase of anxiety before spinal anesthesia, being a safe and
effective anxiolytic remedy, since it did not alter the result
of the psychomotor function test, level of sedation, and hemodynamics.
