Serological screening for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was performed by trained professionals
using immunochromatographic reaction-based tests. The diagnostic One Step COVID-2019 Test
(Guangzhou Wondfo BiotechÂ®, China) was used to determine IgM/IgG antibodies
in whole blood, serum, or human plasma, qualitatively, without distinguishing
the immunoglobulin type [21].
