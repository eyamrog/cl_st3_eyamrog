There are actions done inside and outside the house, which
means that there are two settings: home and the countryside.
This gives a balance to the story and points out
that the socialization of children takes place both inside and
outside the house. Consequently, cultural patterns and social norms are
shared with children in both settings. Table 2 illustrates some
aspects related to the visual representation of both fathers and
the number of times there is physical contact between them.
As the table shows, around one third of the times
that both fathers are together, there is physical contact between
them in Me, Daddy & Dad (2017), i.e., the signs
of affection between both fathers are few and not very
explicit. When Emily is with her fathers, there are also
very few cases where there is physical contact between her
and the fathers (see Table 2).
