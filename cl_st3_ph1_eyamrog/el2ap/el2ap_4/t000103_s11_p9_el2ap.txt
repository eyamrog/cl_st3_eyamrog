The examples so far are not ambiguous, and it is
not difficult to identify the anaphor’s antecedent. But if we
change the name Mary to Peter, as in (5), would
people think that the anaphor’s antecedent is the subject or
the complement of the main clause? Or maybe another referent,
altogether - someone not mentioned at all in the sentence?
