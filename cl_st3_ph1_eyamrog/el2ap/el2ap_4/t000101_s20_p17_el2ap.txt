“I left the execution, the implementation of public policies, right?
In the past, I worked with conceiving, designing F policies.
Nowadays I do not see room for that, it is
not viable. Someone like myself is out, is not allowed

kind of work, a field that does not make things
happen immediately. It is work in the backstage, taking notes,
building memory of the reversals that are happening” (interviewee 16).
