As shown in the data analyses and in the cloud
maps, different types of emojis were identified as teaching presence.
The Winking Face emoji was often used to minimize the
impact of interventions such as confirming and understanding a task,
encouraging participants’ contributions, keeping the focus of discussions on the
task, etc. The following example illustrates how this emoji was
used to encourage participants’ contributions in Group 1. It can
also be seen that the Smiling Face emoji was used
to acknowledge participants' contributions.
