The sedimentological data did not show any divergence between the
sampling sites, indicating that differences in the distribution of the
taxa along the sampling sites were due to the sedimentological
factors. Instead, the similarity between sites may help to explain
the similarities of the benthic assemblies in the sampling sites.
The amount of organic matter found in the Cachoeira do
Paraíso sediment was similar to the reported by Cunha and
Calijuri (2008) in a study of lotic environments located close
to our study site in Iguape, SP. Similarly to our
study, the authors attributed the low rate of organic matter
as a result of various factors, including the high energy
(CUNHA; CAJURI:, 2008). There is a need to address that
river regime in the Cachoeira do Paraíso waterfall is highly
dependent of the rains, and that intense rainstorms strongly modify
the conditions, making this river a very unstable environment. Under
the influence of rains and thunderstorms, the benthic organisms may
be easily displaced and transported downstream, justifying the characteristics of
the samples.
