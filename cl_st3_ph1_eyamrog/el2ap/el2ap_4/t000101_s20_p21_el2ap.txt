On his third day in office, 3,500 people were dismissed
of their federal appointments (Batista, 2019). For those who were
not civil servants, this meant having to leave the government.
For civil servants, the termination of their appointments meant that
they were no longer in senior positions. Note that, by
the time Bolsonaro took office in 2019, it had been
two and a half years since the PT government had
ended and a lot of bureaucratic reshuffling had already occurred,
as indicated above.
