At the end of the collection period, the database was
consolidated by merging the three stages of the survey conducted
in the two cities. A consistency analysis was then carried
out to verify the consistency of the data, the presence
of typing errors, or the absence of data. The sample
weight of each selected unit (census tract, household, and individual)
was calculated separately for each city, taking into consideration the
inverse of the probability of selection, according to the sampling
plan of the study and according to data from the
2010 demographic census. An adjustment was applied to compensate for
the loss of interviews due to non-response and the weight
of the household and the selected resident was calibrated, so
that the population totals by sex and age group (18
to 29 years, 30 to 49 years, 50 to 59
years, and 60 years and older) were consistent with the
2019 population projections (DATASUS) [22].
