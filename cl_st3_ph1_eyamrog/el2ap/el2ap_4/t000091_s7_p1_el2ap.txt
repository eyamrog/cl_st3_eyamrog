Anxiety is an important component of patients' stress in the
dental office, which affects 10 to 60% of the population
(Deogade & Suresan, 2016). Despite technological and scientific advances and
the improvement of techniques, mainly for pain control, dental treatment
can still awaken the feeling of fear, the intensity of
which fluctuates between one patient and another (Dantas et al.,
2016; Facco & Zanette, 2017; da Cunha et al., 2021;).
Invasive dental procedures, such as anesthesia, are related to fear
and anxiety. In addition, these feelings may be related to
culture, previous experience and gender (Vanhee et al., 2020). All
this uncomfortable situation can cause even the calmest patients to
have anxiety peaks before the treatment sessions (Ara√∫jo et al.,
2018; Farah et al., 2019; da Cunha et al., 2021).
