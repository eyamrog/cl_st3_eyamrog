An analysis of the data presented in Figure 10 shows
that all the medical translation theses and dissertations identified in
this study were completed in institutions located in the southeastern
and the south of Brazil. Also, only one dissertation was
completed in a Medical School, rather than in the Department
of Letters and Linguistic Studies of several other universities.
