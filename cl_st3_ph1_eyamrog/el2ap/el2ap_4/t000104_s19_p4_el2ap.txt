21 taxonomic groups were identified considering the 3 sampling sites
(Table 3), until the taxonomic level of order and family.
Beghelli et al (2012) showed that the identification of benthic
macroinvertebrates to species level is only possible when there is
the collection and analysis of the phases of nymph, pupa
and larva, which would be impossible at the time. Additionally,
Silveira (2004) showed that biomonitoring of microbenthic communities can be
successfully achieved when the organisms are identified to main taxonomic
groups, such as class.
