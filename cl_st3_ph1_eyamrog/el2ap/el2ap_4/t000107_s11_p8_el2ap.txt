Pagano and Vasconcellos (2003) proposed a Brazilian translation studies map
using data – that covered the 1980s and 1990s –
recorded in a CD-ROM called Estudos da Tradução no Brasil
(Translation Studies in Brazil), which was released by the Anpoll
Translation Studies working group. The information in the CD-ROM helped
the authors identify translation studies undertaken by Brazilian universities at
the master’s, doctoral, and post-doctoral levels as well as compare
such studies with those on the branches in Holme’s map.
The map that resulted from Pagano and Vasconcellos’ (2003) study
sported the branch of theater (intersemiotic translation), which was not
part of Holmes’ 1972 - 1988 map.
