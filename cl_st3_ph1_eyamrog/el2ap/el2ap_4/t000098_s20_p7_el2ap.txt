Calculating adjusted mortality rates to compensate for the effect of
differences in the age composition of populations is the main
objective of this article. The results of those calculations, performed
according to the methodology described in the previous section, are
reported in Table 3, which gathers information on all 28
countries for which it was possible to obtain age- disaggregated
mortality data. Immediately, we must emphasize that the success of
the adjustment can be inferred from the correlation coefficients between,
on the one hand, an indicator of population aging and,
on the other hand, the crude and adjusted mortality rates.
The correlation between the percentage of the population aged 60
and over and the crude rate is not only positive
but also quite significant: 0.573. With the adjusted rate, the
same indicator presents a very low correlation (-0.252).
