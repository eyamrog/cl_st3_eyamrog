Dad is highlighted in different ways: he is on the
right, on pages 7, 8, and 15, and he is
the one who is doing actions with Emily in most
cases (drawing, page 8; cooking page 12, pushing Emily on
the swing, page 16). In contrast, Daddy is mainly on
the left, on pages 7, 8, and 15, and he
is represented observing the actions that Emily and Dad are
doing on pages 17 and 24. The only exceptions to
such characterizations are on page 19, where he is located
in a centred position, on page 20 where he is
fishing with Emily, and on pages 23, 27, and 28,
where he is on the right next to Dad. This
means that it is Dad who has a more active
role in Emily’s life and in the family. It is
significant that it is Daddy who is placed in the
centre of the page wearing a pink dress, on page
19, as such depiction connects him with some feminine characteristics.
The fact that Emily’s tea set is pink and the
net and bucket that she uses to fish are pink
clearly reinforce that she is a girl, pink being the
colour traditionally linked to femininity. However, the lamp, the bed
cover in Emily’s room, and her pyjamas are purple, which
is the colour traditionally associated with feminism.
