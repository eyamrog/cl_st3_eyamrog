Society in general has been transformed culturally, socially and economically
thanks to the emergence of ICT, which has disrupted human
behavior in the way humans communicate, work, have fun and
learn, a situation that forces them to develop their digital
skills in order to be critical and reflective people about
the proper integration of these resources in any field (Rangel
2015).
