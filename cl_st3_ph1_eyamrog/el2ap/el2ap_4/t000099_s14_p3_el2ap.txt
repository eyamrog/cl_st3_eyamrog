The following growth parameters were evaluated in 20 plants separated
at random from the pool of 25 propagules, per period:
number of leaves and roots; longest leaf and root length.
Only roots over 0.5 cm and expanded leaves were measured.
The selection was performed due to the presence of NS
that did not sprout or seeds that did not germinate
during the experiment.
