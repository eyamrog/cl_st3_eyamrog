The search ran on the BDTD website, using the keyword
tradução retrieved 4,849 thesis and dissertations. As this number proved
to be impractical for the manual identification of studies that
met our selection criteria, we decided to use the keywords
tradução médica (medical translation). These keywords retrieved 633 studies (see
