At the end of 2019, a hitherto unknown coronavirus was
identified in Wuhan (China), which showed unusual characteristics and spread
to the entire planet. Due to the predominantly pulmonary involvement
in its severe forms and its similarities with the microorganism
that caused the pandemic in 2003, it was called SARS
CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) and the disease caused
by it was named COVID-19.
