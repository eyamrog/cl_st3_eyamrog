In developing countries, as is the case of Brazil, protected
areas frequently do not have their respective management plan, and
due to this reason research becomes even more urgent and
necessary to generate knowledge and support the management of these
areas. The Jureia-Itatins Mosaic of Protected Areas is an important
example where the management plan is lacking and scientific information
is required. The region is inserted in the Atlantic Forest
biome, which is a biodiversity hotspot, consisting of a priority
site for conservation, because it is one of largest fragments
of preserved Atlantic tropical rainforest in the country and has
been losing a large area due to the establishment of
cities and agricultural activities at its vicinities (CERATI; ZANINI:, 2009).
