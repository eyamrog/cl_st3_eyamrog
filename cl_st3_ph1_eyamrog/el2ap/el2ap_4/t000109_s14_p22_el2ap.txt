This block represents the influence that public transportation has in
COVID-19 epidemiology. Different public transportation lines were represented as places
or fixed positions on the map, where each bus stop
is a plot of 10x4 m. This simplification aims to
represent only the main characteristics of public transportation dynamics relevant
for this study. Human agents can enter this plot once
every 20 min (average frequency of local transportation), and remain
at an average distance of 2 m, for 20 min.
Distancing is not met only for one minute, which would
represent the time that takes to go from the entrance
door to the seat and from the seat to the
exit door. After 20 minutes, each Ha can either move
to a new position on the map or stay in
the transportation position for another equal period of time (depending
on a transition probability defined by Mobility/Activity submodel, which will
be discussed in the next section).
