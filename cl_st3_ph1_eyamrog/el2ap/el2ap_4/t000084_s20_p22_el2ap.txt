Additionally, emoji use in terms of cognitive presence was significantly,
positively correlated to participants’ attitudes regarding their willingness to apply
mobile technologies (i.e., smartphones, tablets, and apps) to enable and
empower learners with diverse backgrounds, characteristics, and abilities (rs =
.31, p = .02). In other words, the more willing
they were to apply mobile technologies, the more often they
used emojis to exchange ideas and apply new ideas throughout
the course. Emoji use in terms of social presence was
positively correlated to participants’ attitudes regarding their willingness to apply
mobile technologies, but failed to reach significance (rs = .24,
p = .06). Finally, emoji use in terms of teaching
presence is not correlated to participants’ willingness to apply mobile
technologies, (rs = -.01, p = .94). According to Whiteside
(2015), when instructors were able to create social presence in
their courses, as was the case in the present study,
students take on a more active role in constructing their
own knowledge, as well as their peers, regardless of experience.
Therefore, in the present study, regardless of participants’ willingness to
apply mobile technologies to empower others, they felt connected and
helped shape each others’ learning. See Table 6.
