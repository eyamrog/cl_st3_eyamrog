Anxiety in dental patients is a problem for both dental
surgeons and patients. Thus, therapies that aim to control this
anxiety and thus favor the patient's collaboration during treatment become
factors frequently studied in search of the best alternative for
this purpose. Therefore, the objective of this work is to
review in the literature the use of herbal medicines in
the control of dental anxiety. The bibliographic search was carried
out in the databases ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scielo, Pubmed,
The Cochrane Library. 57 articles were included in this study.
Research evidence points to Valeriana officinalis and Passiflora incarnata as
the most studied herbal medicines for controlling anxiety and adverse
effects. Studies prove the relative safety in the use of
these drugs, as well as their effectiveness, low cost, less
concentration of active ingredients with better effects and lesser side
effects when compared to benzodiazepines. However, the use of these
medicinal plants requires further clarification as to their real effectiveness,
correct dosage and side effects in conscious sedation in Dentistry.
