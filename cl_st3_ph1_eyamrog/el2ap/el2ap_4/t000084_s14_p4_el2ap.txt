This study employed an embedded correlational mixed methods design. According
to Creswell and Plano Clark (2018), an embedded approach is
used when both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis
are combined with a traditional quantitative (or qualitative) approach. In
contrast to most mixed methods designs, the purpose is not
necessarily to merge the two data sets since they are
typically used to answer separate research questions. In the current
study, the quantitative data collection and analysis was embedded in
qualitative data collection and analysis. For the qualitative data, transcripts
were collected from the WhatsApp course and coded based on
the CoI framework. Emoji use was analyzed qualitatively using Emoji
word clouds with rich participant descriptions to support the main
findings. Participants’ emoji use was then quantified and correlated with
participants’ attitudes based on pre and post survey responses. Additionally,
participants’ age was correlated to their emoji use to determine
if age influenced emoji use. Finally, emoji use was compared
for male and female participants to determine if gender had
a significant impact on participants’ emoji use. The following research
questions guided this study:
