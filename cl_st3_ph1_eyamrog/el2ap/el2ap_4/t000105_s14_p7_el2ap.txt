The sample size calculation was based on the population estimate
for each city, taking into consideration a confidence level of
95%, a design effect equal to 1.5, and the parameters
presented in Table 1, which also shows the sample distribution
by stage of survey. Considering the losses resulting from refusals,
absence of residents selected for the study, and the existence
of closed households during the visit, a percentage of 20%
of recomposition was added to the sample size in each
city.
