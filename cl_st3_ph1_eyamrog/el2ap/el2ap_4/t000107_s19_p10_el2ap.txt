The next step was to compare the results of the
searches conducted in the three websites. Such comparison allowed us
to identify from which website each thesis and dissertation was
and/or wasnâ€™t retrieved. None of the theses and dissertations retrieved
was catalogued in all three websites (see Figure 7). To
verify this finding, we ran yet another search using the
titles of the theses and dissertations rather than keywords and
filters.
