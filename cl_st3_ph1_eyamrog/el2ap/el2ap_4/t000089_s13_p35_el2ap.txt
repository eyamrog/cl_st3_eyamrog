Conversely, it is in view of the incompatibility of cultural
moral claims that the public school, without disregarding the need
for a reflective and critical knowledge, should be aiming primarily
at promoting truth enquiry, rather than seeking neutrality towards different
narratives. In contemporary democracies, controversial issues regarding the field of
bioethics, gender discrimination, and the relationship between individual and collective
rights are instances of conflicting views of human rights, which
are bound up with distinct ontological and epistemological assumptions. Thus,
in the absence of overlapping principles of justice set out
by aprioristic moral reasons, a merely narrativist account of moral
and political values, detached from a common orientation to the
truth of validity claims, could not bring about social cohesion.
In seeking to assert disparate ethical claims, different cultural communities
would soon realise that there are no common grounds for
the realisation of diverse lifestyles in a single political community,
and would likely opt for disengagement, rather than participation.
