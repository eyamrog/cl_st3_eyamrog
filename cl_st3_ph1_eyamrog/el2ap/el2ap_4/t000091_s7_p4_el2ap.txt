The administration of oral tranquilizing drugs is an alternative for
conscious sedation. Premedication controls stress triggered by the performed procedure,
making the patient calm and cooperative (Loeffler, 1992). The drugs
that are commonly used in dentistry are the oral benzodiazepines
which provide reduction of basal metabolism, salivary flow and vomit
reflex, and relaxation of skeletal muscles (Pinheiro et al., 2014).
