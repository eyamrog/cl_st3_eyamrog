Methods: Based on the guidelines of PRISMA Extension for Scoping
Reviews (PRISMA-ScR), a search was carried out in five databases
(Cochrane Library; PubMed Central®; ScienceDirect; Scopus Elsevier and Web of
science). There was no restriction regarding idiom or year of
publication. The studies found were evaluated manually and with the
assistance of the Rayyan software by two researchers, blindly and
independently. The following keywords were used as a search strategy:
‘breast cancer’ AND ‘physical activity’ OR ‘physical exercise’, AND ‘protocol
study’ OR ‘study protocol’. The inclusion criteria comprised study protocols
of randomized clinical trials with the intervention of physical activity
and/or physical exercise in women undergoing breast cancer treatment and
during post-treatment.
