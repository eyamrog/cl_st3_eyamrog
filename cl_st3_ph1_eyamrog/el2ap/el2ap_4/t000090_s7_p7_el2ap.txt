Another main point studied in the present paper is to
verify if Institutions are usually focused on some of the
Dimensions and Indicators, or if they have a homogeneous behavior
in all the Dimensions. This study will be made for
the 300 “best performers” in Europe, because the institutions with
general better performances have more complete sets of data, in
particular in Europe, which minimizes the problems generated by missing
data.
