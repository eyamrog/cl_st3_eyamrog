As bureaucrats are either actively reshuffled or as they “voluntarily”
choose to exit, the conditions for policy dismantling become more
acute. As recounted earlier by interviewee 47 at the Ministry
of Education, eventually there is no one left to maintain
a public policy. There is no one with the knowledge
and the institutional memory of how the policy works, what
the instruments are, or who the stakeholders are. Everything is
lost, as there is barely anyone left to operate the
policy. This process, as represented below, further feeds into greater
policy dismantling.
