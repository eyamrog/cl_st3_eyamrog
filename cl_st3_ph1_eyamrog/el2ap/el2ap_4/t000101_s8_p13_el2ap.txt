The framework, as it was originally developed, sought to resolve
an apparent contradiction that seemed particularly puzzling: “why might rational,
utility maximizing politicians whose ultimate goal is usually to ensure
their own re-­‐election, deliberately and consciously engage in something as
potentially unpopular as policy dismantling?” (Bauer et al., 2012, p.
31). Such apparent contradiction, although reasonable in discussions of dismantling
in contexts of fiscal constraints, might actually not be present
in processes of policy dismantling occurring in recent examples of
illiberal populism. Working around a narrative of the “deep state”
(Abramson, 2017) or by accusing civil servants of being partisan,
illiberal populists openly dismantle previously existing policies as a deliberate
strategy to please their electoral bases.
