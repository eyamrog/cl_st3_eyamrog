0.75 mg), midazolam 15 mg, Passiflora incarnata 260 mg and
Valeriana officinalis 100 mg. most mentioned drugs in terms of
adverse effects. Which makes many patients prefer not to use
these medications, making the professional look for new alternatives in
these cases. Therefore, a detailed analysis in relation to the
