Figure 1 illustrates the differences in age profiles of populations
by selecting three representatives from each of the groups of
countries indicated above: England and Wales, Brazil, and the Philippines.
In addition to a larger portion in the older age
groups, the English population is divided among similar groups, at
least for the population groups up to the age of
50. Age distribution is very different in the Philippines: participation
in the total population drops continuously with age. Brazil, which
has begun the demographic transition a few decades ago, is
an intermediate case. It should be noted that given the
population preponderance of countries with a similar profile to that
of the Philippines, the age composition of the world population
resembles this one more, albeit in an attenuated version.
