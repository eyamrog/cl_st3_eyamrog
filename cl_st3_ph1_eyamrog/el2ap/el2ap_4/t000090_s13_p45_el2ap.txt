Some interesting facts about the correlations are noted. The Indicator
“External Research Income” has no “strong” or “very strong” correlation
with any other Indicator. It means that, in general, those
external income do not generate more publications, citations, art related
products, etc. The same is true for “Pos-doc” positions, which
do not affect those productions.
