After the presentation of the family done by Emily, at
the beginning of the book, the story shows the different
actions that the girl does with each of her fathers.
There are a few examples of her appearing with both
fathers at the same time in the picturebook, but they
are less than one third of the pages (7 out
of the 24 pages, i.e., 29,16%).
