Emily is observed with Daddy and Dad drawing and painting
on the next page. It is Dad who appears on
the right, the place of the most important part of
the information, drawing next to Emily. Daddy appears on the
left, standing and just observing them painting and drawing. Then,
the next written text appears on the next page where
we also find Papa’s elbow on the left and two
cups of tea and a kettle on the right. This
page makes reference to the different activities that Emily does
with her family. “Craft with paint and string”, which makes
reference to the action represented visually on the previous page,
is only mentioned almost at the end of the written
text. Again, the written text appears on the wall in
a centred position.
