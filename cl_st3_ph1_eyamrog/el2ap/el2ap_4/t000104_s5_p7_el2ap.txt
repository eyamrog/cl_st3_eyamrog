Both Ceratopoginidae and Odonata may be influenced by periods of
rain and dry, and by the water physical-chemical parameters, such
as conductivity, temperature, pH and turbidity (BULÁNKOVÁ, 1997; YANOVIAK 1999ª).
The larval development of many Odonata species is related to
temperature; Lutz (1968) suggested that 20 °C would be limiting
temperature in temperate environments, but this value is unknown for
tropical and subtropical rivers. In this study, Odonata were observed
only in P1.
