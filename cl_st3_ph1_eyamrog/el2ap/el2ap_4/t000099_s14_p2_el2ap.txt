The percentage of oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in
the flasks was determined by a gas analyser (model ILL6600,
Illinois Instruments, Inc., Johnsburg, IL, USA) as described (Lamarca &
Barbedo 2012). These analyses allow an indirect assessment of respiratory
activity by the calculation of O2 consumption and CO2 release
rates. The percentage values of O2 and CO2 were converted
to partial pressure of gas through the equation: p1 P-1
= v1 V-1, where: p1: partial pressure of gas (atm),
P: local atmospheric pressure (= 0.9 atm), v1: gas volume
(%) and V: total volume (= 100%) (Atkins & De
Paula 2001). These values were then converted to Î¼moles of
O2 and CO2 through the equation: p1 V = n
RT, where: V: total volume of air of flasks (L),
n: number of moles of gas, R: gas universal constant
(0.082 atm L mol-1 K-1), T: temperature (in Kelvin) (Atkins
& De Paula 2001).
