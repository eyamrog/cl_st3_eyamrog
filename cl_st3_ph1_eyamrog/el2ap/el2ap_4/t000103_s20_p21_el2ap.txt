After the percentages presented in the tables were obtained from
SPSS, multiple t-tests were conducted to determine what may have
affected the choice of the antecedent in the pairs of
sentences. The tests have shown that Portuguese speakersâ€™ results were
influenced at the 0.001 significance level by the salience of
the anaphors in the three languages when there was no
semantic opposition to the Position of Antecedent Strategy. Although Spanish
and English native speakers were not influenced by the order
of the clauses or by the salience of the anaphors,
participants from all languages were influenced by the semantic relation
between the verbs (p < 0.03). Students from different Portuguese
varieties and with distinct proficiency levels did not significantly differ
from one another.
