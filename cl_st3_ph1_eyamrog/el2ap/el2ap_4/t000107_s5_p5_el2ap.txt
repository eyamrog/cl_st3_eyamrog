Of the 14 works retrieved from the websites described above,
only one was not available in digital format for consultation
(A Tradução de Resumos/Abstracts de Dissertações e de Teses da
Área Médica, Patrícia Dias Reis, 2002). In the remaining 13
studies examined, we found that all authors used corpus linguistics
in different ways to carry out their research. This finding
highlights the importance of this approach for the translation of
specialized language texts, in our case medical translation. Regarding the
type of corpus used, four studies used a comparable corpus
to: (1) identify and verify patterns for expressions typically used
in the development and textual organization of scientific articles, (2)
analyze the use of the word submit, (3) investigate specialized
collocations in cardiology texts, and (4) analyze lexical bundles in
the field of health sciences (medicine, nutrition, and pharmacy). Five
studies used a parallel corpus to: (1) produce a Portuguese-English
glossary in the field of cardiology, (2) analyze the occurrence
of compounds (Komposita) in German, (3) analyze how the retextualization
of abstracts in the biomedical field takes place, (4) investigate
textual markers revealing difficulties to the translator due to intercultural
problems, and (5) search for candidates for terms in the
biomedical field. Two studies used both parallel and comparable corpora
to produce glossaries. The two remaining studies, a dissertation and
a thesis, failed to provide information about the kind of
corpus used in the abstract, an essential piece of information
that should have been mentioned there. The dissertation used a
corpus to analyze anatomical language and the thesis to produce
a collocation glossary for texts on arterial hyperstension.
