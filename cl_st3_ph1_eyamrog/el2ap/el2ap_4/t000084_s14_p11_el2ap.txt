In order to answer the second research question, how do
participants’ attitudes relate to their emoji use, Spearman Rho analyses
were conducted on participants’ posttest scores and emoji use. Unfortunately,
only 61 participants completed both the pretest (including the demographic
information) and posttest; therefore, the researcher’s only examined the emoji
use for these 61 participants to answer the second two
research questions. To answer the third research question, how do
age and gender relate to and help explain emoji use,
spearman rho analyses were conducted on age and emoji use
and independent samples t tests were conducted with gender as
the IV and emoji use as the DV.
