Besides the affectionate response, which can be considered a strategy
of group proximity, Figure 5 shows a high number of
the clapping emoji which was used when participants completed a
task, working as a positive reinforcement in the group. This
type of feedback can be considered a strategy to increase
members proximity and keep group cohesion. The Clapping Hands emoji
, Thumbs-Up emoji , Winking Face emoji , Face With
Tears of Joy emoji , and the Smiling Face With
Smiling Eyes emoji were highly used by female participants as
non-verbal communication resources to make up for the absence of
gestures used in face-to-face interactions. As Alshenqeeti (2016, p. 64)
claims, “visual forms of language, which include non-verbal communication such
as body language have been used since prehistoric times to
underline and reinforce verbal language. Emojis therefore, are simply placing
these visual forms into the digital arena.”
