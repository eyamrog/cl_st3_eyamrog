Carminatiâ€™s (2002) Position of Antecedent Strategy (PAS) explains that the
interpretation of the anaphor in Italian sentences with intrasentential anaphora
depends on the syntactic function of its antecedent. Null pronouns
in the subject position usually point back to the subject
of the main clause (as in (3)), while unstressed overt
pronouns in the subject position usually point back to the
complement of the main clause (as in (4)). However, it
is not clear if this theory would apply to the
differences between unstressed and stressed pronouns in a non- null
subject language like English.
