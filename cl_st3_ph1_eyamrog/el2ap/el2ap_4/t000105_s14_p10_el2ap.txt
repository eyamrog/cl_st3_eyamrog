The interviewers were subdivided into teams coordinated by the six
researchers. Each team received online training conducted by the coordinators/researchers,
in which the project objectives and data collection methodology were
addressed, and the interview questionnaire was disseminated. Subsequently, face-to-face training
sessions for interviewers were conducted at the Medical School of
the Federal University of Ouro Preto, on the use of
the digital questionnaire (Appendix 1) and how to approach the
interviewees, ethical aspects, and biosafety during data collection.
