This study aims to determine how (a) ambiguity resolution differs
in English, Spanish, and Portuguese; (b) L2 learners are influenced
by their L1 regarding ambiguity resolution; and (c) the order
of the clauses, (d) the salience of the anaphor, or
(e) the choice of verbs may affect this process. A
total of 181 people answered an online survey and selected
the antecedent of the anaphor for 16 ambiguous sentences. The
Position of Antecedent Strategy was tested for the three languages
and the conclusion was that it applies to European and
Brazilian Portuguese, but not for Spanish or English. While Spanish
and English native speakers tend to interpret the subject of
the subordinate clause as corresponding to the subject of the
main clause, learners are influenced by their L1 and seem
uncertain especially on how to resolve pronominal cataphora. Finally, we
have concluded that semantics has a great influence on the
resolution of ambiguous anaphora in these languages, and we suggest
that it should be taken in consideration during the design
of a study like this one.
