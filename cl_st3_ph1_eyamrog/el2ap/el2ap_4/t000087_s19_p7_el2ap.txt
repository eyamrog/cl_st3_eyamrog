In Table 1 we present that the incidence of COVID-19
in unvaccinated individuals was 35.1% (95%CI 25.5 to 45.6), and
in vaccinated individuals was 11.4% (95%CI 5.1 to 21.3). There
was a statistically significant difference of COVID infected individuals in
the unvaccinated group compared to the vaccinated group (𝝌2= 12.6,
p=0.00). The Odds Ratio when comparing unvaccinated vs. vaccinated was
of 4.19 (95%CI 1.79-9.8).
