Since the pandemic first days, international cooperative efforts have been
made to gather indicators to monitor its spread1. The numbers
of cases, deaths, and people recovered are tracked, both on
the most recent day and the accumulated tolls to that
day. The problems with the accuracy of the information and,
further more, its internationally discrepant levels make the number of
cases an unsuitable variable for comparison between countries. Even if
the suffering caused by Covid-19 cannot in any way be
narrowed to the situations that culminate in death, the differences
in the availability of tests – especially, but not only,
in the early stages of the pandemic – imply that
case-based indicators are, strictly speaking, incomparable. Although death records are
not problem-free, they provide a safer basis for comparative analyses.
