In 2015, Ofsted carried out an inspection in 22 independent
faith schools and found that at least 10 of them
failed to meet the standards of the Curriculum, while four
failed to demonstrate that they promote fundamental British values. Regarding
the former, Ofsted stressed that those schools were not providing
a sufficiently broad curriculum whereby pupils could develop their aesthetic
and creative skills. For the latter, it was pointed out
that the narrowness of the curriculum deprived pupils of opportunities
to understand other religious traditions and beliefs. Moreover, gender issues
surfaced in some Muslim schools as Ofsted found that men
and women were set apart for the performance of ordinary
tasks, while managers “were not protecting pupils from reading inappropriate
literature about extremist, sexist or partisan views” (United Kingdom, Ofsted,
2015, p. 15-16). The report also raised concern about the
fact that many children did not have basic knowledge of
British history, politics and institutions, with very few being able
to name any political parties.
