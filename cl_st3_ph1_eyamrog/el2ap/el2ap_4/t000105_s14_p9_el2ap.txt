The data collection team was composed of researchers, interviewers, and
phlebotomists. The interviewers were recruited from the academic environment, with
those interested being students who were enrolled regularly in undergraduate
or graduate courses. The candidates underwent interviews in which their
availability and interest were evaluated. After the selection, the students
received a digital document, a video that explained the research
objectives.
