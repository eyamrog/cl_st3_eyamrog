Childrenâ€™s picturebooks are important in the development of literacy, and
their linguistic and visual content contribute to the socialization of
children and to the acquisition of cultural norms that will
help children establish relationships inside and outside the classroom (Arizpe,
Farrell & McAdam, 2013; Evans, 2015). In this sense, children
will develop their ideology and internalise social patterns at the
same time as they become interested in literature (Painter, 2018).
