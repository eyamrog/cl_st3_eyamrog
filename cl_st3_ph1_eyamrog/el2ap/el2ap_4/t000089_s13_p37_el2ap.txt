Hauerwas’ assumptions overlook the possibilities of mutual learning that the
pursuit of religious lifestyles in plural environments could provide for
believers. In enclosing a certain conception of the good life,
and the virtues associated with it, in a narrativist account
of faith virtues, Hauerwas dismisses the capacity for expansion of
one’s religious conceptual resources, in a way that allows for
different understandings of how to apply gospel principles in distinct
social contexts. From the perspective of an intersubjective reason, narratives
are always in a process of reconstruction, making possible the
actualisation of a framework of virtues according to conjunctural goals.
Thus, just like Christians have widely abandoned the idea that
slavery is a legitimate institution, or at least appropriate for
contemporary democracies – a view that many slave owners in
the United States used to support with biblical arguments (for
example, the fact that St. Paul had sent a slave
back to his master, Philemon, combined with a hierarchical view
of the duties of spiritual and material service)5 – they
can also question the meaning of Christ’s passion in different
contexts for the concept of self-sacrifice. Does it mean that
Christians must never use violence, even when there are other
innocent lives at stake? Or should it be interpreted as
a guiding principle for the avoidance of hatred and the
practice of forgiveness? By engaging in this learning process, both
religious and secular citizens can find common principles of moral
action, inclusive by taking into consideration the possibilities of differentiated
attitudes in the Church and in plural contexts. They can,
for instance, arrive at the conclusion that violence is permissible
– or even required – for the purpose of self-defence,
but forgiveness should be preferred to retribution, once life threat
is ruled out, and whenever national reconciliation requires – as
Desmond Tutu (1999) has demonstrated with the conception of Ubuntu
in South Africa6.
