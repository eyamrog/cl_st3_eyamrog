The chemical composition of valerian includes volatile oil sesquiterpenes (including
valeric acid), iridoids (valepotriates), alkaloids, furanofuran, lignans, and free amino
acids such as tyrosine, arginine, and glutamine. Although it is
believed that the sesquiterpene components of volatile oil are responsible
for most of the biological effects of valerian, it is
likely that all of the active constituents of valerian act
synergistically to produce a clinical response (Houghton, 1999).
