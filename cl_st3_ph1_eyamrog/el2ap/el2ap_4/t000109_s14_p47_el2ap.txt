This submodel represents the possibility of Ha to become infected
due to the contact with surfaces previously contaminated by another
Ha. According to some studies [44] [45], the most common
everyday materials to human contact are plastics. There, the virus
can last for a time that depends exponentially and inversely
on ambient temperature. If an infected Ha remains in a
given location longer than 16 minutes, it is possible that
it leaves an infectious trail on the objects handled (fomites).
This can be mathematically modeled [44] as: 𝑃(𝑡) = 𝑒((−𝑏).𝑡)
