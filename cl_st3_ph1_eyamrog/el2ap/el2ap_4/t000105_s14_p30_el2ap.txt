The questions about personal information were aimed at obtaining information
for the registration and reporting of serological test results to
the Ministry of Health, through the electronic system of epidemiological
surveillance for notifications to the Unique Health System (e-SUS VE),
to assist in the monitoring and analysis of the epidemiological
situation of COVID-19 in the municipalities. The other questions assessed
the living conditions of the population, allowing us to perform
a situational analysis of the determinants of health.
