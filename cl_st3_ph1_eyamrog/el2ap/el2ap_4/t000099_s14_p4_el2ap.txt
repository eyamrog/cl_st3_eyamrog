For the evaluation of number of shoots per propagule, a
separate batch of NS and seeds were cultivated in 250
mL flasks containing 40 mL of MS/5 culture media and
maintained in a growth room under 12-h photoperiod, 25±2 °C
and 30 μmol m-2 s-1 irradiance. Shoot production was assessed
every 15 days of in vitro culture up to 75
days in 15 plants per period (five plants per flask
in a total of three flasks).
