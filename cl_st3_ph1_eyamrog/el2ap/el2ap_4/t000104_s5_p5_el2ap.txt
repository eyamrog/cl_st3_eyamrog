The order Diptera includes several organisms, which can be found
in contaminated water bodies, such as those that receive input
from sewers, standing water in urban environments, and others (FAGUNDES;
SHIMIZU:, 1997). Other studies show a higher density of Diptera
in degraded environments, due to the high rate of organic
matter present (OLIVEIRA et al., 2010; MACHADO et al., 2015).
However, the dominance of first order opportunistic organisms in the
Itingu√ßu River probably is due to natural factors, such as
the wide variations of river flow, then to anthropic factors.
