(Initial in vitro plant establishment of seeds and nodal segments
from bromeliad Acanthostachys strobilacea (Schult. & Schult.f.) Klotzsch differs in
respiratory rates and shoot formation). We aimed to investigate the
morphological and respiratory differences during in vitro shoot formation from
seeds and nodal segments (NS) of Acanthostachys strobilacea (Schult. &
Schult.f.) Klotzsch, due to differences in plants obtained by micropropagation.
During 35 days of culture, seeds resulted in full plants
14 days earlier than NS, with longer leaves and more
roots. Nevertheless, NS plantlets exhibited shoot multiplication. Peaks in O2
consumption and CO2 release were detected at 7 and 14
days for NS and seeds, respectively, suggesting that initial growth
has a high energetic requirement. However, the respiration peak was
higher in NS than in seeds, possibly due to high
energy consumption required for multiple bud breaks. After peaking, respiration
decreased, reaching similar values between propagules by 35 days, indicative
of an ongoing increase in photosynthesis in both seed and
NS plants, possibly due to shoot growth. In conclusion, the
development process of NS plants may affect the energy and
respiratory demand differently than in seedlings.
