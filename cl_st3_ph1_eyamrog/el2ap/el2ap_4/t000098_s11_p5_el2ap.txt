A complete treatment of the issue addressed in this article
should preferably deal with all three factors, adjusting mortality rates
to the previous prevalence of comorbidities and differences in demographic
structures regarding sex and age. The data available at the
time this article is being written make this impossible. Albeit
from the earliest moments of the pandemic, researchers have called
governments to systematize and disseminate data on cases and deaths
disaggregated by age and sex [DOWD et al., 2020: 9,696],
the crossing of this information in most cases remains unavailable.
The record of comorbidities among those killed by Covid-19 is
even more flawed and less available [HEUVELINE & TZEN, 2020:
8]. Considering that not only age is the factor that
most markedly conditions the risk of severe Covid-19 and death,
but also that heterogeneity between populations is much higher in
age composition than in gender distribution [GUILMOTO, 2020: 9], it
is justifiable in an initial research effort to focus on
the age-related adjustment.
