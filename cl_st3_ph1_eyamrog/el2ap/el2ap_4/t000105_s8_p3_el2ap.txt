Other difficulties related specifically to the disease include: the greater
probability that only people with severe symptoms seek health care
services and undergo diagnostic tests, the high percentage of infected
people with mild symptoms or who are asymptomatic, and the
social determination of the disease itself [5-7]. These factors can
interfere with the dynamics of transmission, giving rise to underreporting,
and the masking of the actual COVID-19 data.
