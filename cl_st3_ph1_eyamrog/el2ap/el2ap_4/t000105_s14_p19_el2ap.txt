At the end of the blood collection process, the interviewer
commenced the face-to-face interview, which lasted between 30 to 45
minutes, varying according to the perception and dexterity of the
interviewee in answering the questions. Data collection was conducted using
the DataGoalÂ® application that was installed on the tablets to
capture the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the interviewee's
home.
