Among the resources that can generate knowledge in any context,
are the Personal Learning Environments or PLE, which supposedly break
rigid schemes and principles of education in a training institution,
thereby increasing a student's self-organized learning based on their interests
and needs (Llorente & Cabero 2012). In addition, Rus-Casas and
other coworkers mention that with PLE “sustainable learning objectives such
as information management and organization, collaborative work, and integration were
achieved” (Rus-Casas et al. 2021:13).
