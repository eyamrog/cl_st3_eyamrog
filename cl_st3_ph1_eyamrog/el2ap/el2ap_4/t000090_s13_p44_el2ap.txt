There are eleven more “moderate” correlations, as shown in Table
5. In general, the average of the magnitude of all
Indicators of this Dimension is 0.3515 and the standard deviation
is 0.1763. This is the highest average of all the
Dimensions, but it is not high enough to consider the
Indicators as redundant. Therefore, the results also validate this Dimension
for the group of Institutions studied here.
