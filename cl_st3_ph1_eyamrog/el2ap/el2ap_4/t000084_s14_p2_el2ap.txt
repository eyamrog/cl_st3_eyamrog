As can be seen on the map, the highest number
of participants are from the South East and the North
East regions of the country. It is worth mentioning the
potential of mobile applications, especially WhatsApp, to both reach and
gather people from different locations. In a continental size country
like Brazil, it was possible for people from urban and
rural areas to participate in the course on mobile learning.
