The liberal the claim that the privilege conceded to Christianity
in RE syllabuses and in the life of school violates
basic standards of liberal equality by marginalising minority worldviews and
reproducing structures of dominance deserves to be addressed. Indeed, the
liberal objection is sound in that reflective thinking requires a
polyphonic appreciation of accepted social values and public norms. Nevertheless,
when it comes to the educative enterprise, it is necessary
to bear in mind the experiential dimension of the process
of knowledge acquisition, which in pragmatist philosophies are associated with
the intellectual canons of a tradition or cultural perceptions articulated
from within social activities. As John Dewey and Richard Rorty
have noted, the immersion into social activities is a fundamental
part of any learning effort, as it is through collective
experiences that individuals acquire the resources to find meaning in
the objects of their thinking.
