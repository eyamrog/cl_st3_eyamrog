To calculate the position of each Ha at each instant,
AbCSim generates a series of waypoints in specific geographical locations
from a set of HMM [25]. Each of these HMM
defines the probabilities of moving from one position to another
one, depending on the position occupied by Ha in the
previous instant and on the activities defined for the Ha's
particular attributes.
