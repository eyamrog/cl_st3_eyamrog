The reliability issue connected to the Domínio Público website was
triggered by the identification of theses and dissertations completed within
the period stipulated for this study, through the Google search
engine, that were not catalogued on this website. We suppose
that the absence of theses and dissertations on www.dominiopublico.gov.br is
due to problems related to a lack of feeding and/or
regular feeding of information.
