- C: This location represents Haâ€™s home and, therefore, has
only one possible outcome. The specific location in the geographical
map of the city that means the output for this
state is defined as an attribute for each Ha and
is part of the Location submodel. This attribute is randomly
chosen from a geographical area of the city defined as
habitable at the beginning of the run and is the
same throughout the simulation.
