The definition encompasses an interesting and useful distinction between different
types of policy dismantling strategies: active dismantling, dismantling by default,
symbolic dismantling, and dismantling by arena shifting. Additionally, it includes
the possibility that dismantling may be pursued by a manipulation
of the capacities for policy implementation. All of these elements
of the policy dismantling framework are not only useful but
also applicable to policy dismantling processes underway in Bolsonaroâ€™s Brazil,
as indicated below.
