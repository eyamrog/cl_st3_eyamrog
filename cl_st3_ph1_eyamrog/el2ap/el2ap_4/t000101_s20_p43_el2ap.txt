Fear and worry are common elements in many interviews. They
are expressed either as a direct consequence of an experience
lived by the research participant or as a reflection of
cases of persecution and intimidation experienced by colleagues. In general,
there seems to be an overall institutional climate of worry,
retraction, and self-­‐censorship.
