Strategies to hinder viral binding have been investigated. Human recombinant
ACE2 reduced SARS-CoV-2 recovery in vitro and protected mice from
acute lung injury caused by SARS-CoV (Monteil et al. 2020).
A chimeric protein composed of the extracellular domain of ACE2
fused with the Fc region of IgG1 exhibited pharmacological properties
in mice (Lei et al. 2020). SARS-CoV-2 has two possible
entry mechanisms, through endosome or membrane fusion. Arbidol is a
potent broad-spectrum antiviral, that blocks viral envelope fusion (Teissier et
al. 2011) and clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Blaising et al. 2013), suppressing
the replication of SARS-CoV in vitro (Khamitov et al. 2008).
Patients treated with Arbidol had a shorter period of SARS-CoV-
2 infection compared to patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir (Zhu et
al. 2020).
