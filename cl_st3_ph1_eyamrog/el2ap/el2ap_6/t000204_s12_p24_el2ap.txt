In developing autonomy to conduct studies in times of COVID-19,
one should consider that, in the encephalon, there are three
levels of attention behaviour formation: the alert state; focus and
concentration. The alert state is the initial condition for concentration
in the teaching-learning process, as well as the adequacy and
adaptation of educators and learners to the new physical and
social context. Furthermore, the teaching-learning process must be permeated by
motivation. Motivation is reflected in attention and memory. With the
maintenance of the alert state, one reaches the focus and
consequently, the concentration (42, 43). During and after the COVID-19
pandemic, the relationship between educators and learners must be carefully
established before neural processes of coding and plasticity, which result
in the formation of positive and negative memories, from short
to long term (44).
