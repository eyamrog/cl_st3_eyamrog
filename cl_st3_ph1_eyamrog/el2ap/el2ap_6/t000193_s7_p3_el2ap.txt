Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, demyelinating, autoimmune disease of
the CNS4. It is the most common demyelinating disease and
the main cause of neurological disability in young adults following
trauma5. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) — differential diagnosis of
MS — is a group of recurrent autoimmune diseases of
the CNS that classically affects the optic nerves and spinal
cord6. It is associated with the presence of antibodies against
aquaporin-4 (AQP4-IgG) water channel in more than 70% of cases7.
AQP4-IgG seronegative NMOSD comprises a heterogeneous group of both monophasic
and relapsing inflammatory CNS disorders, which include diseases related to
myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies (MOG IgG), post-infectious inflammation, and other
conditions caused by unidentified antibodies8,9. NMOSD represents approximately 20% of
all demyelinating diseases of the CNS in Latin America9.
