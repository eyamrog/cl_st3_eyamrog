Note that thromboprophylaxis is necessary during the hospitalization of patients
with COVID-19, unless there is a contraindication, the choice and
duration of therapy varying according to the patientâ€™s clinical situation
and the protocol established in the hospital unit, and based
on the guidelines of the Hemostasis and Thrombosis Societies. The
post-discharge thromboprophylaxis of the patient with COVID-19 remains lacking in
data, with no consensus, and the decision for its use
and DD cutoff point that guides its choice must be
made individually, always analyzing the risk of thrombotic or bleeding
events, according to established institutional protocols based on previous safe
evidence.
