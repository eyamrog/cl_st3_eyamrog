Learning a new language definitely involves many skills or capabilities
to understand and express effectively. The four main language skills
are Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing. In our country, a
place where there is no immersion and English is a
foreign language rather than a second one, teachers need to
be inventive and try to use authentic elements, given that
their input might be the only one received by students
in their learning process (Bekes 2016).
