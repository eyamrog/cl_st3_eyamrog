Creation of the Network of Healthcare Professionals for the Right
to Decide With a view to creating new instruments that
contribute to overcoming the obstacles to the access to non-punishable
abortion in Argentina, the “National Campaign for the Right to
Legal, Safe and Free Abortion”, a federal coalition of more
than five hundred organizations and personalities that have been doing
advocacy work since 2014, promoted the creation of the Network.
The proposal was originally thought of as a strategy which
would produce a response for those who request an abortion
in public institutions.
