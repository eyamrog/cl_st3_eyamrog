Interferon release is one of the most important natural defense
mechanisms against viral infection. In vivo experiments showed that treatment
with IFN-β1b reduced pulmonary infiltrates, bronchointerstitial pneumonia, and viral load
against MERS-CoV (Chan et al. 2015). IFN-α, a mismatched double-stranded
RNA Interferon inducer, and the IFN inducer Ampligen, inhibited SARS-CoV
replication in the lungs (Barnard et al. 2006). IFN-λ also
showed activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, establishing an antiviral state
and presenting minimal systemic inflammation (Prokunina-Olsson et al. 2020). Antibodies
against cytokines are presented in 88 studies, while 34 focus
on IFN, either by inhibiting them or by giving their
recombinant form to treat patients (Cochrane COVID-19 Study register).
