So, at the current juncture, if a large number of
people tend to experience clinically significant fear and anxiety during
an outbreak of infectious disease (27) (TAYLOR, 2019) and if
there is a massive exposure of the whole society to
potentially traumatic events, as in the case of COVID-19 pandemic,

disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Thus, it is crucial
that health professionals understand the psychological risks of those with
this specific condition (28).
