In this Figure it was possible, based on the Price
Law 6-8, to affirm that the proportion of variance explained
by the exponential model (R² = 0,4306) is larger than
in the case of the linear model (R² = 0,0202).
Based on these results, we can conclude that publications about
SARS show a good fit with the Price Law 6-8
when considering the period (1989-2020). This also shows that the
growth of scientific literature in the research area is in
the exponential growth stage.
