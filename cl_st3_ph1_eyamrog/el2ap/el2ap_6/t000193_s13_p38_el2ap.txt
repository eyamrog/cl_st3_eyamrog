MS/NMOSD patients are included in the special population with higher
risk of severe infection, according to the Brazilian government. Nevertheless,
currently, there is no clear evidence that MS/NMOSD infected patients
present a higher risk of life-threatening SARS-CoV-2 disease. The Brazilian
Academy of Neurology is developing a national database with MS
patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 to investigate this risk in our
country62. In the Italian case series of 232 MS patients
who acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection, 96% of them presented mild disease.
Only five patients died (2%)47. Four out of these five
patients presented significant comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, cerebrovascular and cardiac
diseases), and their mean age was 66.8 (54â€“82) years47.
