Cities in which there was no notification of COVID-19 until
the date of analysis were less populous and exhibited lower
rates of tests, both rapid and molecular (Table 1), in
comparison to the cities in the other group. Accordingly, there
was a notorious predominance of disease notifications in the health
macro-regions Central, Northern Triangle and Southeast. In turn, the macro-regions
Northeast, Jequitinhonha and East concentrated more than 40% of the
215 cities without records of the disease until the date
of analysis.
