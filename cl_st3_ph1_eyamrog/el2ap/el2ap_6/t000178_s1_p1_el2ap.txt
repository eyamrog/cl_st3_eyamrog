Peru is one of the most biodiverse countries in the
world. Genetic diversity is an important component of biodiversity, and
it is crucial for current efforts to protect and sustainably
manage several organisms and habitats. As far as we know,
there is only one work describing Peruvian genetic information stored
in public databases. We aimed to update this previous work
searching in four public databases that stored sequencing information: Nucleotide,
BioProject, PATRIC), BOLD. With this information we comment on the
contribution of Peruvian institutions during recent years. In Nucleotide, the
largest database, Bacteria are the most sequenced organisms by Peruvian
institutions (70.60%), pathogenic bacteria such as Pasteurella multocida, Neisseria meningitidis,
and Vibrio parahaemolyticus were the most abundant. We found no
sequence records from the Archaea domain. In BioProject, the most
common sequence belongs to Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Infantis.
In PATRIC, a database for pathogenic agents, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and
Yersinia pestis had the highest number of entries. Finally, in
BOLD, exclusively Eukaryotic database, Chordata (Aves and Actinopterygii), Angiospermae, and
Arthropoda (Insecta, and Arachnida) were the most frequent records. Our
results would indicate research preferences of Peruvian institutions, focusing on
infectious diseases. Although there has been a significant increase of
DNA information submitted by Peruvian institutions since the last report,
the genetic diversity reflected in these databases remains inconsistent with
the diversity in the country. More efforts must be made
to know obtain genetic information from more underestimated taxonomic groups
and to promote more genetic research in regional Peruvian institutions.
