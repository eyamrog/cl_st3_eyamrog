Discussions regarding how we should return to our pre-clinical and
clinical activities started in April. From that point, it was
already clear that regardless as to when we would return,
key aspects would have to be observed, such as social
distancing, review of infection control practices and specific COVID-19 assessment
of patients and staff. Social distancing in Australia was determined
as 1.5m, with no more than one person per 4
sqm of the room area. These basic principles meant that
we had to do a very complex revision of our
timetables and clinical sessions, as most classes would necessarily have
to be “double taught”. Most clinics had a 6-chair layout
with one supervisor, and with the new model, we could
only use three chairs, and the supervisor would look after
two clinics. We had to reduce the length of the
sessions from 3 h to 2h and 30 min, and
by doing so we managed to have four sessions a
day (from 7:30 am to 7:30 pm), instead of the
regular three sessions per day. Although we could fit all
students, overall, there was still an inevitable reduction of the
number of patients seen per student, as we did not
have enough physical space to double all sessions. This change
in the timetable affected the entire school and required changes
to the Prosthetics Lab as well as the Simulation Lab,
ensuring we all followed this new timetable.
