Quantitative assessment of secondary data was performed from a cross-sectional
epidemiological research design, and descriptive and inferential statistical methods were
used for statistical analysis. The results were obtained through the
use of the libraries Matplotlib (version 3.2.1), Pandas (version 1.0.5)
and Statistics in the Python™ programming language (version 3.7.7). The
programming environment used was Project Jupyter©.
