The evolution in the number of deaths per day for
Brazil displays a quite different behav­ior, shown in Figure 5.
The flattening, which is very evident for São Paulo State
(Figure 1) and for São Paulo City (Figure 3), is
much shorter for the case of Brazil, lasting only for
three or four days, before the curve starts to grow
again (Figure 5).
