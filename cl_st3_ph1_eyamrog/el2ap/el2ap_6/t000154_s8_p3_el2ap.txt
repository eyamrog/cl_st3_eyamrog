“Open peer review” is an umbrella term for peer review
innovations in the spirit of open science (Ross-Hellauer, 2017; Tennant
et al., 2017; Wolfram et al., 2020). Ross-Hellauer (2017) found
122 definitions of open peer review, consisting of various combinations
of seven “traits”: open identities was defined as when “authors
and reviewers are aware of each other’s identity”; open reports
was defined as when “review reports are published alongside the
relevant article”; open participation was defined as when “the wider
community are able to contribute to the review process”; open
interaction was defined as when “direct reciprocal discussion between author(s)
and reviewers, and/or between reviewers, is allowed and encouraged”; open
pre-review manuscripts was defined as when “manuscripts are made immediately
available (e.g., via pre-print servers like arXiv) in advance of
any formal peer review procedures”; open final version commenting was
defined as “review or commenting on final ‘version of record’
publications”; and open platforms (“decoupled review”) was defined as when
“review is facilitated by a different organizational entity than the
venue of publication.” Open identities and open reports are included
in most definitions of open peer review and are thus
considered “core traits” (Ross-Hellauer, 2017). Refer to Ross-Hellauer (2017) for
an analysis of which trait responds to which shortcoming of
traditional peer review and fit into which school of open
science, and to Ross-Hellauer (2017), Tennant et al. (2017), and
Bruce et al. (2016) for reviews of the evidence base
for different traits of open peer review. In the Global
North, “born open” journals on natural sciences or medicine account
for much of the open peer review adoption (Tennant et
al., 2017; Wolfram et al., 2020). In the Global South,
the SciELO Network is probably one of the main organizations
driving the adoption of open peer review.
