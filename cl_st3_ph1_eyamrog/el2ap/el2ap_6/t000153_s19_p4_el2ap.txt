As it can be understood in its foundational charter (Carta
Pública 2015), the Network’s proposal differs, in many ways, from
the medical corporation or hegemonic medicine and puts forth new
senses for abortion to be deemed a matter of health.
Therefore, the Network aspires to adopt new practices so as
for these to become “normalcy” inside the institutional culture. But
who creates normalcy? Creating a sense of normalcy is probably
one of the greatest challenges facing the Network, which has
managed to allow for members to experience a “there-are-others-like-me” feeling.
