In light of the above, and in addition to promoting
a discussion about this important and urgent problem, this work
aims to: present the types of transfer (food and/or cash
rations) carried out by Brazilian state authorities to children and
adolescents who are away from school; and propose strategies for
monitoring and controlling the use of these transfers by families,
in order to mitigate the risks arising from the lack
of food for these students during the COVID-19 pandemic.
