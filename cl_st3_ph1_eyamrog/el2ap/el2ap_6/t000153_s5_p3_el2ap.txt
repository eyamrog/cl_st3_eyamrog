Every professional meeting constitutes an opportunity to share and analyze
various experiences springing from the care offered in doctorsâ€™ offices
around the country. Based on this information exchange, it was
possible to establish similar criteria regarding the need to meet
the demand for access to safe abortions. We are talking
about the counselling pre and post abortion sessions, in the
very same workspaces of the professionals in the Network. Even
when the counselling sessions differ in accordance with the context
and the possibilities to have human and material resources, these
sessions are based on a risk and harm reduction approach,
as a strategy to minimize the negative effects of the
abortion practice in contexts of restrictive laws6 (Briozzo, Labandera, Gorgoroso,
Pons 2007). In practice, the sessions amount to offering evidence-based
information regarding the use of medicine to perform an abortion,
the prescription of medicine to be bought in drugstores, and,
finally, the setting of a date for the post-abortion ultrasound
control two weeks later. The second step is more complex,
since it requires that women have access to the economic
resources necessary to buy Misoprostol, a patented medicine, whose off-label
use allows for a self-induced abortion. Other resources that may
be necessary could be an adequate physical space for the
practice, access to a support network and the possibility to
notice the alert signs which could lead to an obstetric
emergency.
