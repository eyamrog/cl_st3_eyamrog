The fifth-instar individuals of Belminus species used in this study
originated from laboratory colonies containing insects that were collected from
domiciles in different localities of Colombia (Sandoval et al. 2004,
Galvão and Angulo 2006, Sandoval et al. 2010). Collected bugs
were captured from the following Colombian locations: B. ferroae specimens
were captured in Santa Catalina (07°07′26″N, 72°11′24″) and San Alberto
(17°12′40″N, 72°19′12″) in the municipality of Toledo, Northern Santander; B.
herreri specimens were captured around a house in the municipality
of El Carmen, Santander (6°39′30″N, 73°38′56″) and in dwellings in
the municipality of San Martin, Cesar (07°58′47″N, 73°32′26″); and B.
corredori specimens were captured in a house in San Gil,
Santander (6°33′18″N, 73°04′00″). Colonies started in the laboratory during the
following years: B. herreri in 2000, B. corredori in 2002
and B. ferroae in 2005. Bugs were fed on cockroaches
in laboratory conditions as described by Sandoval et al. (2013).
Belminus colony has been at the premises of the Venezuelan
Institute for Scientific Research (Mérida, Venezuela) for five years. Insects
were kept at 23 ± 2°C, 82 ± 7% RH
(relative humidity) in light dark cycle of 12/12 hours, and
starved for 8–12 days from emergence before assays. They were
fed 5th nymphs of Blaberus giganteus cockroaches (Blaberidae), which were
fed food formulated for canines and corn seeds. Belminus bugs
and cockroaches shared the same container since hatching for 5
months. Each bug was used only once to avoid bias
from learning (Aldana et al. 2008).
