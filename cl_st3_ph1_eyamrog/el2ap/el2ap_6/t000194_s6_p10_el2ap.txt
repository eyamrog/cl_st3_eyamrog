The results of this study confirm that the diversity of
aquatic Hyphomycetes in insular environments is fairly higher than has
been registered by other studies in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest
for instances. In the Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga-PEFI,
an Atlantic Rainforest reminiscent located in São Paulo State, Schoenlein-Crusius
et al. (2009), observed 24 taxa of aquatic Hyphomycetes, from
submerged mixed leaf litter in 10 different sampling sites. In
the northeast Atlantic Rainforest, from Monte da Pioneira, Serra da
Jibóia north zone, Fiuza & Gusmão (2011) identified 10 aquatic
Hyphomycetes in stream foam.
