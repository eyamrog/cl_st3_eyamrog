Participants were invited through four different advertisements. SBMFC mailed an
invitation to its eligible members on April 7 and again
on May 8, 2020; RBMFC mailed an announcement about the
survey to its registered users (readers, authors, reviewers and others)
on April 12 and again on May 5, 2020; one
of the survey authors forwarded the mailed announcement to SBMFC’s
email discussion list on May 6, 2020; and RBMFC displayed
throughout the survey period an announcement in its rightmost lateral
column, above the fold (that is, visible without scrolling down,
at least with screen sizes larger than those of smartphones).
As in the informed consent page, the advertisements expressed the
survey objectives neutrally and listed who was eligible to participate.
Because we anticipated there would be some overlap between the
stakeholder groups, all advertisements linked to the same landing page.
This landing page did not require a username and/or password,
but was accessible only for those who knew its URL
(uniform resource locator, the network “address”).
