In addition to the scope of prevention and diagnosis, it
is worth mentioning that the prediction of deaths by COVID-19
is also useful in the hospital organization for the provision
of care to individuals who evolve to the severe form
of infection. A study carried out in Brazil showed that
health regions with the highest averages in mortality from hypertension,
neoplasms, diabetes, heart, and respiratory diseases are located in regions
with scarcity of beds in intensive care units and mechanical
ventilators.22 This leads to the understanding that an efficient planning
on the distribution of assistance resources is necessary for an
equitable confrontation of the epidemic by COVID-19 in Brazil. Otherwise,
a breakdown in the health system can further aggravate the
number of deaths in the country.
