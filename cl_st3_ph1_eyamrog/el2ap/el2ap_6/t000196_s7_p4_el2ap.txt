School feeding programs work under the auspices of promoting Food
and Nutritional Security (SAN) and it is in this context
that the school environment is the fundamental and strategic space
for promoting SAN, since it provides meals and also helps
in the formation of healthy eating habits. The benefit of
school meals is incalculable, because healthy eating is a way
of providing child development through adequate nutrition, improving cognitive ability,
as well as contributing to reducing school dropout rates. Therefore,
in countries with great social difficulties, such as Brazil, Mexico,
Ecuador and Ghana, for example, many children rely on schools
as their main source of food [8]; and, during this
pandemic, the lack of food can impair the development of
these children and adolescents and contribute to increased school dropout
rates [9].
