Still, at the same time, the MPV points to an
average monthly increase of approximately 25% in the number of
cases of leptospirosis. In the period from April to September,
it was possible to observer a positive correlation (r =
0.60), an explanatory power for the rates of leptospirosis as
a consequence of Santa Catarinaâ€™s rainfall volumes (R2 = 0.36),
and an average drop (MPV) of 3.05% in the interpretation
of the monthly trend.
