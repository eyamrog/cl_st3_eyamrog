Density maps with inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation type were
setup with the spread of the cumulative COVID-19 deaths per
1,000,000 habitants, using actual and modelled Boltzmann data. For this,
we used the cartographic base of Brazil available in the
IBGE electronic database and reported data on COVID-19.11 Terra Datum
model SIRGAS 2000 and the cartographic projection corresponding to the
Mercator Transversal Universal system were used. The georeferenced data were
incorporated into Quantum GIS (Open Source Geospatial Foundation, OSGeo, CHI,
USA, Version 3.10.5).
