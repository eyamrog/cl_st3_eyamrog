UV-C radiation has a short wavelength and high energy, compared
to other UV radiation, which enables it to function the
best in a direct line and at a short distance.
Due to the high energy of the UV-C radiation, it
is bound to the inverse square law where the propagation
of light intensity decreases exponentially with increasing distance from the
light source. Studies developed by Escombe et al. [24] and
Casanova et al. [25] provided that there is a sufficient
circulation inside the room to mix the air, upper-room UV
fixtures have shown to be an effective asset for use
in infection control in high-risk clinical settings.
