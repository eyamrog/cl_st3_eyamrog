We acknowledge that highly active MS patients may need a
more aggressive approach, even when facing a higher infection risk
in a pandemic. Patients who are older at symptom onset25
(>35 years), have any pyramidal sign, and present greater disability
(Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score â‰¥3.0) in the first
year after symptom onset are at higher risk of developing
aggressive disease. Those patients represent around 10% of MS patients
and deserve a very individualized and shared approach. Induction therapy
may be plausible in this setting25.
