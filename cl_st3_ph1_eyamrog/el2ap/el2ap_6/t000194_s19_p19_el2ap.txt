Notes: the genus Pleiochaeta was described by (Sacc.) S. Hughes
(1951), having the species P. setosa as the type species.
In addition to this, other five species were described. This
is a dematiaceous fungi, with cylindrical-fusiform conidia with appendages (Castañeda
Ruíz et al. 1996). This is the first report of
the species for Brazil.
