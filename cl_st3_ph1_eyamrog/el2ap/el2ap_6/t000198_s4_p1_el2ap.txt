Numerous and critical difficulties have arisen as a result of
the pandemic for individuals, communities and institutions that will have
long-lasting effects. Our students face disruption to their education and
career; our professional colleagues will be challenged rebuilding their practices,
while staff at all Dental Schools are experiencing various hardships.
However, we believe that our response to these difficulties has
been a challenging and rewarding learning experience. The way we
practise dentistry and deliver dental education has changed significantly as
a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we should share
our experiences and learn from each other. We should take
this scenario as an excellent opportunity for all of us
to review our clinical practices, our biosafety, and be forever
stimulated to try new ways to teach to the next
generation of dentists. The future of dental education needs to
incorporate the role of new pandemics within their accreditation requirements.
