Notes: according to Ryvarden (2004), this species has dark resinous
bands in the context as a distinguishing characteristic. It is
easily confused with Ganoderma lucidum (Curtis) P. Karst., because they
are macroscopically similar (Martins-Júnior et al. 2011), but they differ
microscopically by the hyphal system, dimitic in G. stipitatum and
trimitic in G. lucidum and by the basidiospores, ellipsoid to
oblong, truncate at apex in G. stipitatum and ellipsoid to
obovate in G. lucidum (Groposo & Loguercio-Leite 2002, Singh et
al. 2014). This is a new record for the Distrito
Federal and for the State of Goiás.
