The twenty-four questions were presented in a Likert format in
five categories of responses (never, occasionally, sometimes, often, most of
the time). According to the authors, scores range from 0
to 100 indicating mild to moderate distress (between 28 and
51) and severe distress (≥52). CPDI content has been validated
by Psychiatrists from the Shanghai Mental Health Center considering its
Cronbach’s alpha 0.95 (p<0.001) (Qiu, Shen, Zhao, Wang, Xie &
Xu, 2020).
