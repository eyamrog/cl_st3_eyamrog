Moreover, CQ and HCQ have shown some in vivo effects
against SARS-CoV-2 (Wang et al. 2020b). A group of Chinese
researchers recently reported beneficial effects of chloroquine in the treatment
of COVID-19, however, without yet publishing data (Gao et al.
2020). Another group of French researchers reported that hydroxychloroquine decreased
SARS-CoV-2 levels in a small group of tested patients, and
the administration of azithromycin appears to improve such effects (Gautret
et al. 2020). A recent review analyzed several ongoing clinical
trials and indicates there are paradoxical results, some have shown
beneficial results, others point to the toxicity issues (Sharma 2020).
One important point is that there are different strains of
SARS-CoV-2 circulating (Wang et al. 2020a). Importantly, CQ has pro-apoptotic
activity and the prophylactic use of CQ has been linked
to the selection of intracellular pathogen strains that promote cell
resistance to apoptosis and enhanced lethality, as observed for HIV
and SARS-CoV (Parris 2004). Despite being a low-cost drug, it
is a consensus among health agencies such as the WHO
that further studies are needed for the clinical use of
CQ and HCQ for COVID-19 treatment. Until now, 390 clinical
trials are registered using HCQ or CQ to enlighten their
role in SARS-CoV-2 infection treatment (Cochrane COVID-19 Study register).
