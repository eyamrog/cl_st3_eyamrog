Several studies have shown the modulation of cellular pathways by
coronavirus proteins, favoring the viral cycle or impacting the viral
pathogenesis, which is summarized in table 2. Among these studies,
interactions were found between the coronavirus nsp1 protein with the
cyclophilins PPIA, PPIG, PPIH, and FKBP1A, FKBP1B, which are capable
of modulating the Calcineurin/NFAT pathway, which plays an important role
in the activation of immune cells (Pfefferle et al. 2011).
The same study, which used the yeast two-hybrid system to
demonstrate those interactions, showed that the inhibition of cyclophilins by
cyclosporine A (CspA) blocked the replication of different CoVs, including
the human coronaviruses SARS-CoV, CoV-229E and -NL-63, the feline CoV
and the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Another study has
demonstrated the interaction between the SARS-CoV nsp2 and cellular prohibitins,
suggesting that this nsp may be involved in the disruption
of intracellular host signaling (Cornillez-Ty et al. 2009).
