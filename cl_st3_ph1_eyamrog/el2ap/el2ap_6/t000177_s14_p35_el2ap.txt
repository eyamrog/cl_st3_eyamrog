Casanova et al. [25] studied the effects of air temperature
and humidity on two surrogates of SARS- CoV, namely transmissible
gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). These viruses
could serve as conservative substitutes of SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses
for modeling exposure, risk of transmission and control measures for
human pathogenic viruses in health care surfaces .
