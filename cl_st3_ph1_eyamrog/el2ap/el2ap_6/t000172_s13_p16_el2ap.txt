E protein plays a role in the assembly and release
of virions from cells, being involved in viral pathogenesis (DeDiego
et al. 2007). It is a small protein (~8â€“12 kDa)
and is found in small amounts within the virion. Protein
E is a homopentameric transmembrane protein, possessing an N-terminal ectodomain,
a C-terminal endodomain, and ion channel activity, and such activity
in SARS-CoV is not necessary for viral replication but has
an impact on viral pathogenesis (Nieto-Torres et al. 2014). Recombinant
viruses without protein E are viable but attenuated, unlike other
structural proteins, although this effect is dependent on the virus
type (DeDiego et al. 2007). Interacts with M membrane protein
in the budding compartment of the cell, located in the
ERGIC (Chen et al. 2009a). SARS-CoV E protein interacts with
PALS1 protein (Protein Associated with Lin-Seven 1) via the PDZ
binding motif in its C-terminal domain and delays the formation
of tight junctions, altering epithelial morphogenesis (Teoh et al. 2010).
Another study showed that palmitoylation of E protein is crucial
for the assembly of murine coronavirus (Boscarino et al. 2008).
