A study conducted in Portugal by Mottola20, in the Autonomous
Region of the Azores, in particular on the islands of
SÃ£o Miguel and Terceira, found that the incidence rate is
ten times higher when compared to the mainland. This situation
was justified by the conditions of moisture and average temperatures
of subtropical climate in the region of the islands, thereby
promoting the spread of leptospirosis, with a greater number of
cases registered from September to January.
