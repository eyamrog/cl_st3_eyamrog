One of the strengths of our study was the representativeness
of the results at the country level in Peru, allowing
us to test the scales in different outpatient settings. Also,
there was quality control and real-time monitoring of the data
being collected. However, we recognized three mains limitations. First, despite
having evidence of internal structure for the three instruments, our
scales lacked a cut-off that could have determined whether a
Peruvian physician was satisfied or not with any of the
dimensions evaluated. This happened because we found no robust result
in both sensitivity and specificity analyses performed for the selected
scales. Second, validity and reliability estimates were only estimated on
outpatient physicians; therefore, results cannot be generalized to other health
professionals or doctors in other settings such as hospitals or
community settings. Third, as this was secondary data analysis, it
was not possible to evaluate some variables that would allow
a better understanding of job satisfaction. For example, race, the
presence of a diagnosed mental health problem, etc. weâ€™re not
considered.
