We hope the community of taxonomists gets engaged with renewed
strength in actions directly connected to the development and promotion
of our science. Instead of being deeply focused on proprietary
gaming, irreproducible journal metrics sold to our institutions and research
funders, controlled by a USA/UK based company, itself acquired in
2016 by two private equity funds (Onex Corporation and Baring
Private Equity Asia â€“ ONEX/BPEA; see Cision Ltd./PR Newswire 2016,
https://prn.to/31nGDYC, BPEA 2019, https://bit.ly/3hm9yC4) we should perhaps concentrate, for instance,
on securing professional positions for young talented taxonomists, who are
much needed for the proper development and maintenance of museums,
scientific collections, and public digital databases. We are sure that
Zootaxa has provided an invaluable service to the field of
taxonomy. Suppression from JIF will not change or diminish this
remarkable contribution.
