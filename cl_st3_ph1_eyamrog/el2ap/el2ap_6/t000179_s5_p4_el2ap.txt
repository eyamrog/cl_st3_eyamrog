We found evidence of internal structure of the scales resulting
from exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Our analyses indicates that
both the professional activity satisfaction scale and the health center
management scale are one-dimension scales; i.e. all items can be
added up to obtain an overall score (23). For its
part, the satisfaction scale on working conditions was a two-dimension
scale (individual and structural dimensions), so it is possible to
obtain an independent score for each dimension (23).
