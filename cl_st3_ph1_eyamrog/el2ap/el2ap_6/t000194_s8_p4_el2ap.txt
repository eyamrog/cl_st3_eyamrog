The importance of the aquatic anamorphs has been especially emphasized
in lotic systems such as streams with well-aerated, clean, moderately
turbulent waters, with its conidia dispersed in foams or associated
with decaying organic substrates (Ingold 1975). Eventually, some aquatic anamorphs
may be found in terrestrial environments, such as in roots
of plants, including grasses and riparian ferns (Sati & Belwal
2005), also in lentic waters (Suzuki & Nimura 1961, Casper
1965), and more recently in urban, eutrophicated waters (Schoenlein-Crusius et
al. 2009, Schoenlein-Crusius et al. 2014).
