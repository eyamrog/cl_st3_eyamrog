According to Ryan et al. [26], lamps with germicidal ultraviolet
irradiation (eUVGI) decreased the proliferation of microbes in HVAC systems.
The study was carried out in neonatal intensive care units,
and in the ventilation systems of air conditioning units. The
result obtained through the research showed that the patients suffered
a drop in microbial colonization in the trachea and also
had a decrease in the use of antibiotics. The proliferation
of multiple bacteria, fungi and microphones were included among the
HVAC systems, ICU environment and patients, thus allowing to generate
more tests of the results obtained by the application of
UV radiation.
