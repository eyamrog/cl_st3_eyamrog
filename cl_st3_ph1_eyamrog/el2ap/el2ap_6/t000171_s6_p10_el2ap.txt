It is worthwhile noting that the test rate must influence
the incidence and mortality rates, as the diagnostic criterion for
the disease is based on diagnostic tests. In this context,
it is expected that the higher the rate of tests
in a given territory, the greater the reported number of
incidence and mortality. Thus, territories that are not suitable for
testing can suffer from severe underreporting (21). The present methodological
design would be more appropriate in a homogeneous situation of
the rate of tests, which is not possible.
