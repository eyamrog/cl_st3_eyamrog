Most MS DMDs require regular clinical, laboratory, and magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) monitoring to assess disease activity and drug-related side
effects. Lymphopenia, as seen with the use of fingolimod, dimethyl
fumarate, and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, poses a major concern, as
it may be related to a higher incidence of infectious
diseases36.
