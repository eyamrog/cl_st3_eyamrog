In both scales, invariance was reached according to sex, age
groups, marital status, if you have a specialty or not,
if you work in another institution, time working, and whether
you have a work-related or chronic disease (see Supplement 3).
Therefore, comparisons could be made between these groups using each
of these scales. However, it was not possible to evaluate
the invariance according to the type of organization and the
monthly income since they did not meet the required assumptions.
