As mentioned, Federal Law 13,987/20 has the clear objective of
guaranteeing the distribution of food to the families of students
whose schools are closed. When the Law was enacted, the
government of the Federal District opted for the distribution of
food allowances to the parents of students from public schools14.
However, little has been disclosed about the monitoring of this
mitigation measure. Information regarding this initiative in the Federal District
of Brazil can be found on the website of the
State Bureau for Education of the Federal District (SEEDF) [20]
and, as disclosed by this site, during the three phases
of funds released, only 69,848 families are benefiting, or 106,435
students. No information was found regarding criteria for the distribution
of food allowances or the percentage of families receiving benefits,
in relation to the total number of students enrolled in
the public school system of the Federal District. Still, even
for those who receive government assistance, it is necessary to
analyze its effectiveness in relation to the needs of children,
in view of the nutritional requirements presented by schools, as
these requirements cannot be guaranteed at home.
