Vitamin A deficiency in non-hospitalized children between 0 and 12
years old with respiratory tract infections, reached a prevalence of
12-46% [19â€“21], and a severe deficit reached 1.2-3.9% of the
participants [19,20]. Serum retinol levels were inversely related to cough
with fever (p=0.05) [19], and to an increase in total
respiratory resistance in individuals without wheezing (p<0.05) [20]. Children with
vitamin deficiency were more likely admitted to the ICU (p<0.05),
an association that lost significance when adjusted analyzes were conducted
[21], and those with severe deficit were 2.4-fold more likely
to present cough with fever. An increase of 10mg/dL of
plasma retinol was a protective factor contributing to 10% fewer
days of cough with fever (p<0.001) and 6% fewer visits
to the doctor (p<0.05) [19]. Amaral et al. [20] observed
that patients with infections without wheezing and with vitamin A
deficiency had difficulty recovering of respiratory resistance even after clinical
treatment for infection (Chart 2).
