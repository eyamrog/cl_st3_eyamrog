From the practical point of view, the methodological-technical considerations contemplated
in the various surveys prepared by the Ministry of Education,
Culture and Sport of Spain, the Ibero- American Observatory of
Culture and the Satellite Accounts of Culture have been studied
and incorporated. The result of this process has been the
design of a base instrument adapted and contextualized to the
university scenario, which has been subjected to a pilot test
procedure and continuous checking.
