Applying Lotka's law, it is possible to identify an inversely
proportional relationship between the number of authors and articles produced.
Nevertheless, the constant found in Figure 2 confirms the postulate
that represents the thought 'many with little and few with
much (7-10), since the greater the number of articles produced,
the smaller should be the number of authors. This research
result overcomes the limitations imposed by the biosafety level 4
requirement for SARS research, and directly related to increased funding
for studies of infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS. Funding has
been reported to have a positive influence on research outcome
and citations of a specific disease 14.
