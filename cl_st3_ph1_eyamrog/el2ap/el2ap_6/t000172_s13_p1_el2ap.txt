The Coronaviridae family is part of the Nidovirales order and
can be divided into 2 subfamilies: Coronavirinae and Torovirinae. The
Coronavirinae subfamily has 4 genera: alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-coronaviruses.
SARS-CoV-2 (also called 2019- nCoV) is the coronavirus that causes
COVID-19, and together with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, are part of
the genus Betacoronavirus. A study showed that SARS-CoV-2 is more
similar (88% identity) to two SARS-like coronaviruses derived from bats
(bat- SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21), collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern
China, than with SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%)
(Lu et al. 2020). Another study has shown that SARS-CoV-2
genome is 91.02% identical to Pangolin- CoV, despite a higher
identity of 96.2% between SARS-CoV-2 and another bat coronavirus (RaTG13)
(Zhang et al. 2020c). The coronaviruses genome is composed of
a single-stranded positive RNA (ssRNA+), therefore included in class IV
of the Baltimore classification (Baltimore 1971). The genomic organization of
coronaviruses can be divided into two main parts, the genes
encoding the non-structural poly-proteins pp1a and pp1b and the genes
encoding the structural genes, including the S, E, M and
N genes, as shown in figure 1.
