Notes: species representative in terms of sampling and showing resistance
to changes in seasonality with sampling in dry and rainy
seasons in the studied areas. The holotype is reported for
the State of Goiás in 1932 (Gibertoni et al. 2008).
In this case, the species is recorded again for the
State of Goiás after 88 years. Among the available descriptions
for the species hyphal system, Furtado (1968) and Ryvarden (2004),
expose arguments. The first considers the system as a trimitic,
composed of generative hyphae with clamp connections; branched thick-walled connective
hyphae and arboriform skeletal hyphae. The second considers the system
as dimitic, composed of generative hyphae with clamp connections and
arboriform skeletal hyphae. In the present study, trimitic hyphal system
was adopted. In the field, the species is very similar
to A. calcigenum (Berk.) Torrend, distinguished by the presence of
ellipsoid basidiospores. Among the distinctive characters, the reddish color of
basidiome and globose basidiospores, yellowish with dense reticles-shaped ornamentation is
highlighted.
