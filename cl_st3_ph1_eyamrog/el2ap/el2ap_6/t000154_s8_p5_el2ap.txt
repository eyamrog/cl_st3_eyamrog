One proposed strategy if for editors to survey their communities’
attitudes to open peer review (Ross-Hellauer; Görögh, 2019). Previous surveys
found open identities to be the trait scholars though less
likely to improve peer review (Ross-Hellauer et al., 2017) and
double-blind peer review to be preferred over single-blind or open
identities (Mulligan et al., 2013; Bernal; Román-Molina, 2018). To the
best of our knowledge, no survey about open peer review
has targeted a scholarly community in the Global South yet.
