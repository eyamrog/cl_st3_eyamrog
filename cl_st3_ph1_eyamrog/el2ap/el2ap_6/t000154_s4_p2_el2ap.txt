To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
survey to actively recruit and separately describe the attitudes of
a journal’s readers or members of a journal’s learned society.
Both stakeholder groups were found to be even more supportive
of open peer review than the journal’s authors and reviewers,
providing some assurance for editors from society journals to experiment
with open peer review. Stakeholders of scholarly journals published by
university departments might be more uniform in their attitudes.
