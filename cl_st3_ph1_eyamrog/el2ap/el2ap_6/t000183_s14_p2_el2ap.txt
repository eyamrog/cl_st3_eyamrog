This research work was based on a quasi-experimental design and
it is a nonequivalent group design, which means that a
pretest and a post-test will be needed to compare two
groups: one treated and the comparison one. In this type
of research, the independent variable is manipulated and participants are
not randomly assigned to conditions.
