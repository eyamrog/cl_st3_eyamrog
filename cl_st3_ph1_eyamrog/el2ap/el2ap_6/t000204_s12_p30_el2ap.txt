The resumption of activities must be not only based on
the fulfilment of the school curriculum but also support for
psychological and social care. Psychological problems, when left untreated, can
affect family/children's relationships, academic performance, and social functioning (50). Furthermore,
childhood mental health problems often continue into adulthood and lead
to decreased productivity, increased substance abuse, and substantial economic burden
to the individual and society (51, 52).
