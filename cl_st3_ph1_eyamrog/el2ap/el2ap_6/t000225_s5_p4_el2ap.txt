For the rest of São Paulo State, the situation in
terms of control over the spread of the disease seems
worse, as shown in Figure 4. Except for São Paulo
City, the summary for the state is shown in Table
2. In this case, we do not present a value
for the SDI, given that it does not seem to
make sense to consider an index averaged over the 645
differ­ ent municipalities, which have a wide range of different
populations and social charac­ teristics. It is worth mentioning that
from April 6th to April 19th, the number of munic­
ipalities in which there was at least one death attributed
to COVID-19 grew from 33 to 91. This factor implies
that the dynamics for the spread must have involved bringing
the disease from other cities or regions in many cases
(there was no lockdown policy enacted in Brazil until May
11th), which confirms the smaller relevance of local SDS (measured
by an SDI) for this period.
