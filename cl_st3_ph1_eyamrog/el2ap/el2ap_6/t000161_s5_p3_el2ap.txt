The adoption of scientific bibliometric indexes such as JIF has
grown, especially in the last two decades, as a way
to objectively evaluate the strongly competitive field of academic careers.
However, there are many studies showing perverse pitfalls, for both
researchers and organizations, of this use and interpretation of JIF
(e.g., Hecht et al. 1998, Alberts 2013, Chapman et al.
2019). The quest and struggle for publishing in high impact
journals produced the JIF mania (Ioannidis & Thombs 2019).
