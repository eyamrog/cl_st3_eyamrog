Influence of self-citations on JIF is almost insignificant to boost
this metric because most journals from the three categories (Entomology,
Zoology, and TTJ) have similar means of the ratio between
JIF without self-citations and JIF for 2010–2018 (Figure 5), except
Shilap-Revista de Lepidopterologia, a journal devoted to butterflies and moths,
Insects, published by Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI) —a company
with questionable conduct (Retraction Watch 2018) and considered predatory (Brezgov
2014) —, and Zootaxa. Some journals have large intervals based
on SD in the influence of self-citation on JIF, while
journals such as Zootaxa have a more constant influence of
self-citation. For instance, in Zootaxa this ratio ranges from 0.55
to 0.60 and JIF reduces 39.6–45.6% when self-citations are excluded
(Figure 6, Supplementary File 1).
