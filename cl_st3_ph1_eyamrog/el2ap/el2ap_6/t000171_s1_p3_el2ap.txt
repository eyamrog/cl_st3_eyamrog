Results: Positive correlations were found between the rate of rapid
tests and incidence; rate of RT-PCR tests and incidence/mortality. At
the municipal level, incidence, mortality, rate of rapid tests and
RT-PCR revealed a negative correlation with days elapsed since the
First Notified Case. The same effect occurs, at different intensities,
at the level of health macro-regions.
