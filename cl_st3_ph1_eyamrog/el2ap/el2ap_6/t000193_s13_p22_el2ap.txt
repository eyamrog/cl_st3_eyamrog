Teriflunomide is also associated with lymphopenia. Nonetheless, in a pooled
analysis of TEMSO, TOWER, TOPIC, and TENERE, low-grade (Grade 1
or Grade 2) lymphopenia was infrequent, and no high-grade (Grade
3 or Grade 4) lymphopenia was reported. Furthermore, infection rates
in patients treated with teriflunomide were similar in populations with
and without low-grade lymphopenia39. We recommend performing one CBC three
months after introducing the treatment and every six months thereafter.
