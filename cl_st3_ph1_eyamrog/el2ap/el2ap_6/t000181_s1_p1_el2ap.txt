Covid-19 pandemic continues to spread exponentially worldwide, especially in America.
By mid-June, 2020, Brazil is one of the most aﬀected
countries with more than one million cases and up to
50,000 deaths. This study aims to assess the fear and
peri-traumatic stress during the Covid-19 pandemics in Brazil, to enhance
infection control methods, appropriate interventions, and public health policies. A
cross-sectional survey has been conducted from April 12th to 18th
using the Peri-Traumatic Distress Scale (CPDI) and the Fear Scale
(FCV-19S) aiming to measure the peri-traumatic stress and fear as
psychological reactions during the Covid-19 pandemic. For that purpose, an
online spreadsheet was used to send the questionnaire and scales
to a sample of 1844 participants as a collecting information
tool. Both scales showed a correlation factor of (r=0,660). Results
highlight significant gender differences as in both scales women’s mean
scores are higher showing that it is paramount that women’s
voices were represented in policy spaces as socially constructed gender
roles place them in a strategic position to enhance multi-level
interventions (primary and secondary effects of Covid-19), equitable policies, and
new approaches to control the pandemic.
