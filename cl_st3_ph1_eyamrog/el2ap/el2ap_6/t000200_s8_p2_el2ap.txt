In Brazil, leptospirosis is an endemic disease, becoming epidemic in
rainy periods or major climatic events (flooding), affecting particularly low-income
populations living in rodent-infested, flood-prone slums, which occur mainly in
capital cities and metropolitan areas. The magnitude of the risk
depends on the local prevalence of leptospirosis and the degree
and frequency of exposure4-8.
