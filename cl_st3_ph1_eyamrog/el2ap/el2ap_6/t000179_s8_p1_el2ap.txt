Job satisfaction is defined as an emotional state or attitude
towards a job, based on positive or negative experiences and
on the values or expectations of worker (1). International evidence
suggests that health workers with a higher ranked employment are
more likely to be psychologically engaged with work (2). Job
satisfaction is a critical concern to improve health policies because
it can positively affect health workersÂ´ performance and patient satisfaction
(3). However, when there are low levels of job satisfaction
among health workers, detrimental results appear in the form of
burnout, employee turnover, job change, and poor working performance (4-6).
These deficient functioning and quality outcomes worsen accountability and resilience
of healthcare systems, contributing to pervasive health gaps between and
within socioeconomic groups (4-6). Therefore, the evaluation of health workers
job satisfaction, including physician who often lead healthcare teams, is
a significant dimension to consider in the global public health
agenda.
