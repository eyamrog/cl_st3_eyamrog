“The question of stigma, we have talked about it for
some time now, with the team. We organized a meeting,
to review this, because some of us wanted to handle
it or learn about how others dealt with it, i.e.
this situation of telling people, family members, what one does.
In my case, my family is totally aware that I
perform the legal interruption of pregnancy, but I think that
little by little others were also able to tell their
own people, too, while the Network permitted that we come
out in favor of an increased visibility” (M. female, general
practitioner. Interview, Córdoba, June 2017).
