Discussion: The heterogeneity of the incidence and mortality of COVID-19
in the territory of Minas Gerais, as well as the
rate of tests (rapid and RT-PCR) may be caused, in
part, due to the different dates of introduction of the
virus in the municipalities/macro-regions. It is speculated that this phenomenon
occurs due to the dynamics of regional and inter-regional flows
of people.
