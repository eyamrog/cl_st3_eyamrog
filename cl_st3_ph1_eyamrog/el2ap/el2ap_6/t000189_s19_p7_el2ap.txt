All included studies that assessed the impact of vitamin D,
regardless of age, were conducted with hospitalized patients. In children,
the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency ranged from 12% to
85% [17,21] and was positively associated with a higher risk
of severe signs of breathing difficulties (OR:5.065; 95%CI:1.998;12.842; p<0.001) [17].
Children with vitamin D levels below 20ng/mL presented 117% more
chances of using oxygen support and 217% more chances of
needing respiratory support [17]. In addition, Hurwitz et al. [21]
showed that vitamin D deficit in the pediatric group contributed
to greater chances of ICU admission (OR: 3.29; 95%CI: 1.20;9.02;
p<0.05) and mechanical ventilation (OR: 11.2; 95%CI: 2.27;55.25; p<0.001). In
hospitalized adults and elderlies, vitamin D deficiency was prevalent in
80 to 85% of the sample [18,22]. Brance et al.
[18] found no association between the disease symptoms and levels
of respiratory infection. Kim et al. [22] observed that, after
statistical adjustments, there was an increased risk for mortality in
28 days in the group with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) deficiency
(OR: 3.31; 95%CI: 1.17â€“ 9.39; p<0.05) (Chart 2).
