Severe coronavirus infection leads to epithelial cell proliferation, macrophage infiltration
in the lung (Nicholls et al. 2003) and can cause
pulmonary fibrosis, which can still be present in recovered patients
(Antonio et al. 2003). About 15% of COVID-19 patients progress
to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the most severe cases
should be treated in intensive care units (ICU) and receive
oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation (Li et al. 2020). In
extreme cases of COVID-19, lung transplantation is a viable option
(Chen et al. 2020a). The pharmacological interventions against coronaviruses, as
summarized in figure 1 and table 4, are reviewed regarding
their molecular mechanisms of action, effectiveness in vitro and in
vivo, and ongoing clinical trials. There are two important aspects
in the clinical outcome of COVID-19: one is viral entry/replication
and the second is host response. Both are intimately linked
and can be targeted by different compounds.
