Poorly ventilated buildings affect air quality and can contribute to
the spread of the disease, as microorganisms, can be transmitted
by air-conditioning systems. In health facilities where there is a
high concentration of infectious patients, evidence shows that poorly ventilated
buildings have higher risks of infectious disease transmission for patients,
workers, and visitors. Li et al [38] demonstrated the association
between ventilation and air movements in buildings, and the transmission/spread
of infectious diseases.
