Finally, an important study recently showed cellular pathways related to
the coronaviruses RTC, using MHV (mouse hepatitis virus) as a
model (Vâ€™kovski et al. 2019). The study identified that RTC
interacts with translation initiation factors, which may not persist throughout
the replication cycle but may be of transitory importance during
specific phases of the replication cycle. In addition, the knockdown
of some of these factors, such as eIF3E, eIF3F, and
eIF3I, impacted in the MHV replication. Proteins related to transport
and intracellular organization were also related to RTC in this
study.
