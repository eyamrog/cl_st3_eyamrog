Methods: We focus on how to 1) reduce COVID-19 infection
risk, such as social distancing, telemedicine, and wider interval between
laboratory testing/imaging; 2) manage relapses, such as avoiding treatment of
mild relapse and using oral steroids; 3) manage disease-modifying therapies,
such as preference for drugs associated with lower infection risk
(interferons, glatiramer, teriflunomide, and natalizumab) and extended-interval dosing of natalizumab,
when safe; 4) individualize the chosen MS induction-therapy (anti-CD20 monoclonal
antibodies, alemtuzumab, and cladribine); 5) manage NMOSD preventive therapies, including
initial therapy selection and current treatment maintenance; 6) manage MS/NMOSD
patients infected with COVID-19.
