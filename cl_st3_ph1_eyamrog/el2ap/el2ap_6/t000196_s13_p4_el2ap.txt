Even before the pandemic, much research was carried out to
assess the benefits of school meals upon the lives of
students. Previous studies have already shown the positive effects of
school feeding programs on the development of verbal fluency in
malnourished children [13]. Additionally, Jomaa, McDonnell, and Probart [14] presented
a bibliographic survey of articles published over the span of
20 years evaluating school feeding programs and, based on these
articles, analyzed the impact of school feeding programs on the
lives of children and adolescents. This research revealed a relative
positive effect of school meals on student enrollment and dropout
rates, when compared to students not covered by these programs.
