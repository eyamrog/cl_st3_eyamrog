Consider, for example, the different behaviors shown in Figures 3,
4 and 5, highlighting the importance of localized information to
design strategies to cope with the pandemic. Whereas the SDS
in São Paulo City seems to produce results in controlling
the spread of disease, the results for São Paulo State
seem less effective in this respect, and the data for
Brazil indicates a much worse situation. In São Paulo City,
the SDS made the evolution in the number of deaths
to stabilize (or even slightly decrease) between April 7th and
April 20th. It must be noted that the number of
deaths slightly increased after April 21st (Figure 3).
