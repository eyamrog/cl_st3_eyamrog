This line of research in the university field has not
had an impact on the Ecuadorian scientific production until now;
therefore, justifies this study as part of a larger project
that aims to provide data on cultural habits and practices
in the Ecuadorian university context. In addition, these indicators do
not only outline the profile of the student but can
also contribute to a process of integral formation and may
also provide valuable information to the institution when making decisions
in the design of its cultural offer as indicated by
Hinojosa-CÃ³rdova and Silva-Corpus (2008) and Flores et al. (2009).
