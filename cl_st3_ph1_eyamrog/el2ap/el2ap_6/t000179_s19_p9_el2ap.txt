Invariance was reached between marital status categories (those who live
with a couple and those who donÂ´t), having a chronic
disease (those who have vs. those who do not), and
people who have a work-related disease (those who have vs.
those who do not). Therefore, comparisons between these groups could
be performed. On the other hand, invariance was violated between
men and women (sex), between people working in other institutions,
and according to the time working in the institution. Comparisons
between these variables could not be performed (see Supplement 3).
Finally, it was not possible to evaluate invariance according to
the type of organization, monthly income, having a specialty, nor
age of the participant, because necessary assumptions for such analysis
were not fulfilled in this group of variables.
