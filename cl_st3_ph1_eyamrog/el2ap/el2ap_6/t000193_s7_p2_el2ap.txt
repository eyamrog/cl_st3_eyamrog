The coronavirus family shows a potential neurotropism that may induce
neurological disorders, such as inflammatory polyneuropathy, encephalopathy, ischemic stroke, and
demyelinating diseases. Neurotropism can occur via trans- lamina cribrosa with
SARS-CoV-2 penetrating the central nervous system (CNS) through the olfactory
tract. Interaction with human cells probably starts with the bond
between the S1 portion of the virus S protein and
the host angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) type 2 receptors2. Those
receptors are widespread in the human body and the CNS,
as they are present in endothelial and arterial smooth muscle
cells3. Endothelial dysfunction and consequent blood-brain barrier disruption may work
as an entry door for infected leukocytes into the CNS.
This scenario might lead to direct viral damage to the
parenchyma, as observed with other viruses, or trigger clinical events
associated with CNS autoimmune disorders.
