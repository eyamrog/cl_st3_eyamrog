Using a time series analysis referenced to the date of
death, and not to the date of testing for COVID-19,
we demonstrated that the Social Distancing Strategy adopted in São
Paulo State brought substantial results in terms of reducing the
number of infections. The results were evident for São Paulo
City, where the rate of the spread of COVID-19 was
substan­ tially reduced, especially between April 5th and April 20th.
