As non-bibliometric researchers, we suppose that measures in bibliometric science
were created with some genuine purposes, which entail goals other
than supposedly assessing the quality of research or researchers. Originally
these indexes aimed to be objective tools for helping librarians
in the development of journal collections (Haustein & Larivière 2015).
According to Keith Collier (Senior Vice President of Product, Science
Group Clarivate, https://bit.ly/31gOMg3), the JIF mission is “to provide a
thorough, publisher-neutral, multifaceted view of journal performance, reflecting the world’s
highest-quality scientific and scholarly literature.” The hope relies on the
citation frequency that would reflect a journal value and the
use made of it and shows the average citations per
published paper in a given journal (Garfield 1972).
