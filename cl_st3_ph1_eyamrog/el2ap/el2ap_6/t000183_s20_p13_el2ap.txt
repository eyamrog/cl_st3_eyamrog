Graphic organizers are also useful when trying to reach studentsâ€™
different learning styles. They are perfect for visual learners because
they train readers to understand symbols and key words, and
on top of that, they are a varied and interesting
way of learning. Research has shown that graphic organizers are
useful not only as preparation activities, but also as follow
up learning tasks (Dishner, Bean, & Readence, 1981).
