The holy grail quest for Diamond open access (no APC
for authors, DOA) versus paywall policies creates a paradox: how
can journals cover the costs involved in publishing, copyediting, DOI
generation, data insertion into biodiversity databases, file archiving, etc.? These
controversies concerning OA were depicted with vibrant colors during the
gradual transition of big publishersâ€™ journals, such as Diversity and
Distributions, from readers' payment to authors' payment in an APC-OA
model (Peterson et al. 2019). Gradually, the scientific scholarship publications
are changing from paywall to GOA with authors paying the
charges (APC-GOA) for publication in biodiversity journals. Certainly, this is
the best business model option for the big publishers because
it avoids losses generated by white (sometimes named black OA)
or green platforms such as Sci-Hub, ResearchGate, or Academia Inc.
(site: academia.edu). Here it is important to highlight that authors
never received messages from Zootaxa demanding the removal of files
from any such platforms, quite unlike the crusade carried out
by big publishers against these kinds of storage and access-
granting.
