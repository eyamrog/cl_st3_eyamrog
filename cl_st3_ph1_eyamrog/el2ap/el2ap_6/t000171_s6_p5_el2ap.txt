The negative correlations observed when analyzing the time elapsed between
the first notified case in the municipality and the first
notified case in the state may indicate that there is
heterogeneity in the date of introduction of the virus in
the territory, especially when considering the incidence and mortality rates
that tend to be lower the later the first case
is reported. Candido et al. (2020) (16) established the spatio-temporal
flow of COVID- 19 in the Brazilian territory and described
that the health macro-regions of the Northern Triangle, Central, Central
South, South and Southeast are those in which the virus
first entered the territory of Minas Gerais. This is in
agreement with the findings of studies in Brazil (19) and
China (15), which demonstrated that the most affluent regions receive
the virus before other regions.
