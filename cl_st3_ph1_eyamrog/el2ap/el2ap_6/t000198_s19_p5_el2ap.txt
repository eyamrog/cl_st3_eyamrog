When the pandemic started, Australia was one of the first
countries to introduce strong regulations related to social distancing, travel
restrictions, testing and tracking of infected patients. As such, the
universities started to be closed from mid-March, cancelling all clinical
and pre-clinical activities, maintaining online theoretical activities, such as seminars,
lectures, and journal clubs. These activities required a steep learning
curve by all students and academics, and platforms such as
Microsoft Teams® and BlackBoard Collaborate ULTRA® became the main Learn
&Teaching tools used at Griffith University. Several clinically based scenarios
were created and delivered in the format of online problem-based
learning (PBL) discussions. All exams in Semester 1 where delivered
online.
