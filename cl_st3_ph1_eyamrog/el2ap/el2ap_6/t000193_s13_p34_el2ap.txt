Azathioprine is an NMOSD treatment commonly used in Brazil. Azathioprine
adverse-event data from other autoimmune diseases suggest myelosuppression is more
common in the first year of therapy (mean time of
8 months)53,54. Therefore, we recommend considering a longer hematological monitoring
interval for patients with stable azathioprine use (>1 year) to
reduce coronavirus exposure risk. We propose routine laboratory testing every
6 months during the pandemic for these patients.
