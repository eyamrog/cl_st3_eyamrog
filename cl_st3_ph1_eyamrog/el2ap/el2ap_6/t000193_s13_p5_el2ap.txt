After ruling out active infection, the next management step is
to classify relapse severity. For most relapses, consensus treatment consists
of 1000 mg intravenous infusion of methylprednisolone for 3â€“5 days.
However, at least for optic neuritis (ON), this treatment has
proven to speed neurological recovery with no impact on long-term
disability16. Hence, we suggest avoiding corticosteroids for the treatment of
mild outbreaks. We believe faster improvement of mild neurological symptoms
does not outweigh the increased infection risk associated with the
use of steroids.
