The most recent assessment of the Peruvian genetic data in
public databases was done by Norena et al. (2018). The
authors estimated 645 753 sequences in the NCBI Nucleotide database
associated with the term “Peru”, from which 6 522 (1.01%)
were published by national institutions. We updated the amount of
sequencing data of the Peruvian biodiversity submitted by national institutions
to four main public genetic databases: NCBI BioProject, a database
that comprises multiple collections of biological data related to a
single genomic sequencing initiative. NCBI Nucleotide that comprises GenBank and
related databases. The exclusively bacterial database Pathosystems Resource Integration Center
(PATRIC) which provides sequencing, protein-protein interactions and transcriptomic data (Wattam
et al. 2017), and the Barcode of Life Data System
(Ratnasingham & Hebert, 2007), a DNA barcode database, focused in
single markers, namely, the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene for
animals, internal transcribed spacers (ITS) for fungi, and the ribulose-bisphosphate
carboxylase (rbcL) and maturase K (matK) for plants. The same
databases were used by Norena et al. (2018).
