Studies as reviews, letters to the editor, theses, and dissertations
addressing bacterial infections like tuberculosis, carried out with experimental models,
and whose analytical methodology was the assessment of the association
between the infection leading to nutritional deficiency were excluded from
the present review. To increase the sensitivity of the search
for studies related to iron deficiency, the term "anemia" was
included as a descriptor, however, researches that identified anemia exclusively
by assessing hematocrit and hemoglobin, and did not evaluate iron
status by ferritin and transferrin receptor [14,15], were not considered
eligible for the study.
