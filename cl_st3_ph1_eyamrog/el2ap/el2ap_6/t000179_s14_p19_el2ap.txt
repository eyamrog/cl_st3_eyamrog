The adjustment of the different models for the three scales
was evaluated in three steps. First, a set of the
goodness-of-fit indices was estimated. We used the Comparative Fit Index
(CFI) and the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), both with optimal values
â‰¥0.95; Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) and Root Mean
Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) with a confidence interval of
90%, both with values adequate if <0.08 (26, 27). Second
and last step, if a scale had two or more
dimensions, the correlation between the dimensions was evaluated, in order
to test whether dimensions could overlap. Clear differentiation between the
two dimensions can be considered when the correlation is less
than 0.80 (23).
