Furthermore, studies reported that the protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir,
used as HIV antivirals, also appear to have effects against
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Chu et al. 2004; Choy et al.
2020). Both drugs can interact with the protease 3CLpro; ritonavir
has a higher binding affinity compared with lopinavir (Nutho et
al. 2020). Animal experiments against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV showed that
the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) with IFN-β significantly reduced viral
load and improved pulmonary function. The combination of LPV/r shows
a synergistic effect in the treatment of SARS patients (Yao
et al. 2020). A clinical trial (NCT02845843) is currently testing
a combination of lopinavir, ritonavir, and interferon-β1b against MERS (Arabi
et al. 2020). Combined LPV/r reduced the time for the
patients to become negative for SARS-CoV-2 (Yao et al. 2020),
and increased eosinophils, indicating an improvement in COVID-19 clinical outcome
(Liu et al. 2020). Another study, however, reported no difference
in the administration of lopinavir and ritonavir in a group
of patients with COVID-19 already in an advanced stage (Cao
et al. 2020), or shortening of the duration of SARS-CoV-2
shedding (Cheng et al. 2020). A retrospective analysis of adverse
drug reactions (ADRs) from patients with COVID-19 admitted at the
First Hospital of Changsha in China revealed that about 64%
of the observed ADRs were correlated with the use of
LPV/r (Sun et al. 2020). Patients treated with LPV/r presented
a significantly higher proportion of abnormal liver function (Fan et
al. 2020). There are about 211 clinical trials ongoing, considering
these antivirals, using Lopinavir, Ritonavir, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, in combination, alone
or with other drugs in SARS-CoV-2 patients (Cochrane COVID-19 Study
register).
