Conventional medical treatments are based on pharmaceutical drugs and psychological
therapy (53). However, the use of alternative and complementary therapies
(manipulative/body techniques and practices based on attention, music therapy, etc.),
can be an important adjunct treatment and or minimise the
adverse effects themselves caused by pharmaceutical drugs (54, 55). There
is evidence that therapies can help children reduce ADHD /
ADD symptoms, autism, anxiety, depression, and stress (56, 57). Many
studies have suggested mindfulness-based practices (e.g., yoga, tai chi, qigong,
and meditation) may be a beneficial adjunct to the treatment
of mental health problems, particularly mood and anxiety disorders improving
quality of life (58). Mindfulness, the “intentional, accepting, and non-judgmental
focus of one’s attention on the emotions, thoughts, and sensations
occurring in the present moment” (59).
