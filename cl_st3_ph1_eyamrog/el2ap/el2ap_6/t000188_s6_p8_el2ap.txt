Finally, our results suggest that the model used is adequate
to analyze and predict cumulative cases of deaths caused by
COVID-19, since all data sets were well adjusted to the
Boltzmann function. Factors related to the host and its behavior,
the pathogen's ability to survive, and environmental influences can also
alter the analyzed estimate because the estimate of the model
is based on the assumption that the general conditions are
maintained. In addition, predicted deaths may be even greater when
considering the possibility of underreporting. Despite this, the main advantage
of the model used is that it only needs the
cumulative number of confirmed cases or deaths, and this represents
a quick method that can assist in the decision of
measures to contain the pandemic by COVID-19.
