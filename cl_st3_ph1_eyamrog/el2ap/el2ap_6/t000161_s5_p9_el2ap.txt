For almost a decade Zootaxa was the single big (or
mega) journal in the field designed to attend taxonomic science,
even though several smaller journals also published most of their
issues with a high amount of taxonomic papers. Today Zootaxa
has competitors with the advantage of having either Gold Open
Access (GOA) or Diamond Open Access (DOA) policies, such as
the European Journal of Taxonomy (first issue published in 2011)
and ZooKeys (first issue in 2008). However, in the case
of ZooKeys, a minimum APC of €700 is required for
mandatory open access; this is a huge obstacle, especially for
researchers from developing countries, outside the group of those countries
considered of lowest income, who do not automatically qualify for
a fee waiver. The Zootaxa initiative from Magnolia Press Ltd.
was so successful that it stimulated the creation of some
new journals, including Phytotaxa, its sibling version dedicated to plant
sciences. Data on Magnolia Press, which is based in New
Zealand, is not easy to obtain. In the company’s website
(magnoliapress.com) not much information is given, for instance, which is
the registered business model (for-profit or not-for-profit).
