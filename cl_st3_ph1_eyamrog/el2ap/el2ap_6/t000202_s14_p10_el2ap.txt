The survey was applied face-to-face and online, through the Google
Forms platform and carried out in the computer labs of
the University, with the assistance of the members of the
research team. The reference period for collecting the information was
carried out during February 2018. The intervention was carried out
in cycles, and the students responded to the survey in
an approximate time of 30 to 40 minutes.
