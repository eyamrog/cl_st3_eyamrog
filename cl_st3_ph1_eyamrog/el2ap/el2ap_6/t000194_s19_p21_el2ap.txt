Notes: the genus Pyramidospora was described originally by Nilsson (1962),
with the type species P. casuarinae, isolated from Venezuela, the
main feature of this genus is the presence of a
sizeable narrowing in the conidiophore next to where it joins
to the conidium, forming a twist in this region (Singh
1972). Currently the genus consists of nine species. This is
the first record of the species for Brazil.
