Despite the availability of these tools, the low testing of
suspected cases of COVID-19, combined with an upward curve of
new deaths, generates an enormous underreporting of cases and, to
a lesser extent, of deaths from the disease. Other factors,
such as a still very high rate of contagion and
the low adherence of the population to social isolation measures,
have projected an extremely critical scenario for Brazil until the
end of May. Three months after the first case confirmed
by the Ministry of Health, and two months after the
first announced death, Brazil surpassed the mark of more than
one thousand daily deaths due to the coronavirus.5 The current
lethality rate of the disease is 6.3%, being among the
10 highest in the world, and the mortality rate is
currently 10.5 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants.6
