At the same time, what stands out from these professionals’
reports is the notion that “helping women”, which O’Donnel describes
as a “redemptive quality of the job” (O’Donnell, Weitz, Freedman
2011), is done so as to justify a choice (not
made for money) in contrast to a widespread stereotype that
deems clandestine abortion providers as being exclusively interested in making
a profit. Believing in the benefits of, and the need
for, their own job consolidates itself as a strategy that
is conducive to removing the stigma. This capacity to be
active agents who resist and transform a negative experience contributes
to developing healthcare providers’ ability to reduce vulnerability in the
face of stigmatization.
