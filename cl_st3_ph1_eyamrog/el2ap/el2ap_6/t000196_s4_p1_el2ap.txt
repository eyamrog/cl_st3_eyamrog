In times of pandemic, children's nutrition is a crucial aspect
to be discussed by society, given that, for many, school
is the central point of daily support. Ensuring that food
reaches children and is consumed by them is difficult for
governments to monitor, since food or the financial aid to
purchase it is delivered to families, and the lack of
control over the correct distribution and use of this food
makes it difficult to know its effectiveness in mitigating this
problem.
