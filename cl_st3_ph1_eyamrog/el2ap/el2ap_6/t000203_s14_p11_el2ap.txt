The incidents ratio obtained by dividing the incidence rates of
the compared groups was presented for the comparison of the
interest groups. The mortality and lethality ratios are also presented.
To test the null hypothesis that the rates are equal
between groups of interest, the Z-test was used to compare
proportions.
