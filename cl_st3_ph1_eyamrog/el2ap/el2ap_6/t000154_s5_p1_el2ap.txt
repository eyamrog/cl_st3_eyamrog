We reported an online survey with each of four stakeholder
groups of RBMFC, a scholar- led journal from Brazil, on
their attitudes towards open peer review. While few eligible stakeholders
participated in the survey, the neutral language of the advertisements
means participants should have similar attitudes to non-participants. One way
in which participants might differ from non-participants is the extent
to which they concern themselves with peer review in RBMFC,
as indicated by a larger proportion of reviewers participating (in
comparison to the proportion of SBMFC members participating) and by
participants (even among readers and SBMFC members) being more likely
to hold a master’s or PhD degree than family and
community physicians in general (Fontenelle et al., 2020). Furthermore, while
the small sample size precludes precise estimates (as disclosed through
the uncertainty intervals), the survey closely reproduced the methods of
Ross-Hellauer et al. (2017), so that confidence in this survey’s
findings increases to the extent that they are similar to
theirs, and differences between the surveys hint at the possibility
of contextual effects.
