It has been two years since Norena et al. (2018)
reported the first results of Latin American genetic data stored
in public databases. These authors kindly shared their scripts and
information with us to reproduce and compare results. In our
view, open science and data must be promoted, thus, all
our scripts and results can be freely accessed and downloaded
from GitHub. Norena et al. reported 1.01% (~6 500) of
records deposited by Peruvian institutions in NCBI Nucleotide. We showed
an increase of more than two times (14 488) in
records in only two years (Table 1). Although, our calculated
occurrence (1.71%) did not change a lot because the permanent
increase of Nucleotide total records. An independent report by Clark
et al. (2016) compared Genbank information between a similar range
of time (2014-2016) and found two to four-fold increases in
both invertebrate and vertebrate data. In the case of Peru,
INS and UNMSM have generated more data than all other
institutions together (> 8 000 records). In BioProject we found
30.05% records submitted by Peruvian institutions (58 out of 193)
doubling the occurrences found by Norena et al. (15.95%). In
PATRIC, Norena et al. found 0.28% records submitted by Peruvian
institutions while we found 3.62% records (107 out of 2959).
Finally, in BOLD, we reported 3 754 records while Norena
et al. found 3 438. In the latter case, the
increase was smaller than in the other databases.
