Nucleotide data was retrieved using Entrez Direct (Kans 2013). In
April 2020, we downloaded all the records from the Nucleotide
database containing the query "Peru" using the following command, <esearch
-db nucleotide -query "Peru" | efetch -format gb > peru.gb>.
The output of this search, a 30 Gb file in
genbank format, was used to extract information such as the
journal and organism of the published sequence. In Nucleotide, information
of the institution that submitted the genetic sequence is stored
in the “journal” variable. A file containing only unique journal
names was also created to count all Peruvian institutions in
the database. Through awk scripts, we counted how many times
the word "Peru" appeared in the variable journal, how many
times a certain institution uploaded sequences to this database, and
how many organisms have been sequenced. We also analyzed which
organisms were the most sequenced by each institution in Peru.
