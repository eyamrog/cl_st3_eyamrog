Relapse is a demyelinating event of the CNS lasting at
least 24 h, in the absence of fever or infection4.
Thus, infection should be excluded when faced with a worsening
of neurological symptoms of MS. During the pandemic, ruling out
COVID-19 is reasonable. As SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with demyelinating
events in case reports15 during the pandemic, COVID-19 should be
ruled out for all patients with relapses. As an evaluation
protocol, we suggest assessing patients for typical clinical findings (e.g.,
cough, fever, respiratory symptoms, hyposmia/anosmia, and hypogeusia). If present, we
recommend performing chest computed tomography, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, and/or immunological assays.
The sensitivity of the latter may be limited in MS
patients with impaired humoral responses associated with certain DMDs.
