Researchers can benefit from bibliometric analysis techniques, not only in
a quantitative approach, but also in a qualitative one, because
the numbers help in the approximate reading of reality and,
with the inclusion of more in-depth studies, the richness of
the analyses becomes more representative. Therefore, bibliometric studies can contribute
to the visualization of the connections between information from several
areas of knowledge.
