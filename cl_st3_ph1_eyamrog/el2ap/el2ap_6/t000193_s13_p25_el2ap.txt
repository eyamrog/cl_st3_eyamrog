Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (ocrelizumab and off-label use of rituximab) are
frequently used for the treatment of MS. Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies
have previously been linked to an increased risk of severe
viral infections, a major concern during the COVID-19 pandemic. Causal
mechanisms include: neutropenia, lymphopenia, and hypogammaglobulinemia. Therefore, when prescribed, we
recommend CBC and immunoglobulin monitoring (total serum IgA, IgM, IgG)
every six months or in the case of recurrent infection.
Immunoglobulin replacement in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia is associated with lower
infection risk related to rituximab use. We consider this recommendation
particularly important in a viral pandemic context45. CD19 monitoring may
be a reasonable strategy to individualize decision making on dosage
and reinfusion intervals of B-cell depleting therapies46. Nonetheless, in a
recent series, ocrelizumab was not associated with severe COVID-1929,47. Thus,
this treatment option seems reasonable for aggressive MS patients30 with
positive JCV.
