Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an induction treatment for
MS. It aims to stop MS damage by cell depletion
and then repopulate the immune system. This treatment has a
long sustained effect on the immune system. People who have
recently received this treatment should extend the period of isolation
during the COVID-19 outbreak. Patients who are eligible for HSCT
should consult their neurologists and consider postponing the procedure. Table

COVID-19 pandemic.
