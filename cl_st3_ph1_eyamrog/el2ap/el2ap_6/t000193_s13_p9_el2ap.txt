MOG IgG-associated optic neuritis, encephalitis, and myelitis (MONEM) may present
with monophasic or recurrent course8. MOG IgG disease relapses usually
show a favorable response to steroids. In this specific situation,
recurrence is associated with long-term seropositivity for MOG IgG, and
immunosuppressive therapy should be discussed individually23.
