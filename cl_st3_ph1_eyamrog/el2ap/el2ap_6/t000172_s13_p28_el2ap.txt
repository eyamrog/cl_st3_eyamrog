Expression of viral proteins regulates cell fate, not only cell
cycle, but also controls apoptosis, since its importance for viral
replication. SARS-CoV S protein suppresses extrinsic apoptotic pathway, downregulating TRAIL
and FasL, and activates of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, through
upregulation of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and
MDM2, leading to increased levels of p53 and p21 induction
and G1/S arrest (Yeung et al. 2008). ORF9b protein when
accumulated in the nucleus induces caspase 3-mediated apoptosis (Sharma et
al. 2011). Inhibition of apoptosis is also mediated by SARS-CoV
E protein, which down-regulates IRE-1 (inositol-requiring enzyme-1) and DUSP1/10 proteins,
critical regulators of innate immune response and apoptosis (DeDiego et
al. 2011). SUD domain of PLpro interacts with RCHY1 and
promotes p53 degradation, playing a role in cell cycle and
apoptosis control, whereas p53 overexpression was able to inhibit viral
replication (Ma-Lauer et al. 2016). SARS-CoV promotes the expression of
a truncated form of p53, that inhibits apoptosis mediated by
wild-type p53 (Leong et al. 2005). This is supported by
the observation that the Porcine epidemic diarrhea v√≠rus (PEDV) production
is increased in p53 knockout cells (Hao et al. 2019).
