The articles selection criteria included original observational studies, carried out
with respiratory infected individuals manifesting similar COVID-19 symptons, published in
the last 10 years (between 2010 and 2020), in English,
Spanish or Portuguese. The similarity of manifestations of the respiratory
infections included in this review with the symptoms of COVID-19
was assessed based on the Epidemiological Bulletin on 2019- nCoV
[13], which refers to a broad common clinical spectrum between
COVID-19 and other colds, with manifestations ranging from coughing, fever,
and shortness of breath to severe pneumonia.
