Once the complete genomic RNA and mRNAs of each structural
ORFs are produced, the translation of these genes begins to
occur (figure 2, process 3), generating the S, E, M
and N proteins, which are essential for the assembly of
the viral particles, among others (ORFs 3a, 6, 7a /
b, 8 and 9). The specific functions of these proteins
will be described later. The viral replication cycle then continues
through the interaction of the N protein with viral genomic
RNA, forming the nucleocapsid in the cytosol (figure 2, process
4). On the other hand, the production of S, E,
and M proteins are directed to the rough endoplasmic reticulum
(RER) (Fehr and Perlman 2015). Finally, interactions mediated between these
structural proteins culminate in the recruitment of nucleocapsids into the
compartment between RER and the Golgi apparatus called ERGIC (Endoplasmic
Reticulum - Golgi Intermediate Compartment) and finally in the exocytosis
of the viral particles (figure 2, processes 5 and 6)
(Fehr and Perlman 2015). An important feature related to the
replication of coronaviruses is the high rates of mutation and
recombination, altering viral protein properties, host range, and pathogenicity. For
example, the heterologous recombination between subgroup A Betacoronavirus and other
virus is reported, since some of these coronaviruses have the
hemagglutinin esterase gene, derived from influenza C virus (Zeng et
al. 2008). The recombination between coronaviruses targeting different species is
also largely reported and may explain the similarity between the
genome sequence of human SARS-CoV-2 and bat and pangolin coronaviruses
(Lu et al. 2020; Lau et al. 2020). Three aspects
may explain this increased capacity for recombination/mutation:
