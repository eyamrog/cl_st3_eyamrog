This study aimed to describe and compare how three dental
schools from different countries have managed experiences in dental education
during the COVID-19 crisis. Australia, Brazil, and the USA have
the pandemic spread at different times and magnitudes. As of
this writing in early June 2020, USA and Brazil ranked
first and second in the number of confirmed cases worldwide,
respectively [5]. In Australia, the number of new cases rapidly
increased and peaked in March 2020. Since mid-April, there has
been a sustained and relatively low number of new cases
reported daily, with less than 20 new cases per day
since 22 April [7].
