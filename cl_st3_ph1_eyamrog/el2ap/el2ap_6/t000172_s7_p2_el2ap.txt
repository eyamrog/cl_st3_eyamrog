In December 2019, a group of patients from the city
of Wuhan, Hubei province, China, was initially diagnosed with pneumonia
of unknown etiology and epidemiologically linked to a seafood and
wildlife market in the city (Rothan and Byrareddy 2020). Afterward,
reports predicted the appearance of a potential coronavirus outbreak, given
the reproduction number for the new 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-
19, as named by WHO on 11 February 2020) significantly
greater than 1, estimated between intervals of 2.24 to 3.58
(Zhao et al. 2020). Since then, until June 22nd, 2020,
the number of infected people has reached 9,154,232 cases and
473,849 deaths worldwide (Coronavirus Resource Center, John Hopkins University).
