There is evidence that one of the mechanisms through which
yoga improves mood in major depressive disorder is by increasing
the activity of the GABA system (63). Yoga practioners have
increased functions on Superior Parietal Lobule and Supramarginal Gyrus of
the cerebral cortex (64). Long-term Ashtanga Yoga practice decreased regional
glucose metabolism in the medial temporal cortex, striatum, and brainstem
(65). In brainstem is situated the main output of the
encephalic aversion system, the periaqueductal grey matter (PAG), whose activation
elicts unconditioned fear and panic attack-like behaviour (66). Meditation and
Yoga also was associated with a significantly lower right amygdala
volume (67). Both PAG and amygdaloid complex neurons are also
spontaneously activated in a threatening situation (68).
