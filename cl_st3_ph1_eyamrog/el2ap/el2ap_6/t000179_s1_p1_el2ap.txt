To assess the evidences of validity and reliability of a
set of scales on different areas of job satisfaction (general
professional activity, health services management, and working conditions) in Peruvian
physicians based on data from the National Survey of Satisfaction
of Users in Health (ENSUSALUD). Participants were selected from a
two-stage probabilistic national representative sampling stratified by political region. We
included 2,137 participants in the analysis. General professional activity scale
with 6 items (CFI=0.946; RMSEA=0.071) and the health services management
scale with 8 items (CFI=0.972; RMSEA=0.081) showed good measurement properties
for the one- dimensional model. The scale of working conditions
presented adequate measurement properties with a two-dimensional model (CFI=0.914; RMSEA=0.080):
individual conditions (8 items) and infrastructural conditions (3 items). The
invariance analysis presented that comparisons can be made between sex,
age, civil status, medical specialty, working in other institutions, work-related
illness, chronic disease, and time working in health care center.
All scales had adequate internal consistency (ω and α between
0.70 and 0.90). Based on our findings, these instruments are
suitable for measuring job satisfaction among outpatient physicians throughout Peru,
as our data is representative at the country level.
