Nevertheless, around 10%25 of MS patients present with highly active
disease, and these drugs may not be adequate for them
as initial therapy. Additionally, the role of each specific DMD
in risk and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been
established yet. Patients with high disease burden may require high-efficacy
treatments. In these situations, we, as well as the ECTRIMS/Multiple
Sclerosis International Federation (MSIF), recommend selecting therapies not associated with
lymphopenia, such as natalizumab. Use of fingolimod, cladribine, alemtuzumab, and
anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies can lead to lymphopenia28. As they are
associated with significant infection risk in real-world data, we propose
an individualized risk/benefit analysis before prescribing these drugs. Moreover, in
a recent pharmacovigilance series, ocrelizumab was not associated with the
more severe course of COVID- 1929. Therefore, ocrelizumab may be
a treatment option for patients with aggressive MS30.
