In a research conducted by Mawson [30], an extensive consideration
about vitamin A supplementation in Influenza infection was available, verifying
that supplemental vitamin A seems to induce Influenza-like symptoms, a
hypothesis formulated given the increase in respiratory symptoms reported in
the studies analyzed by the review. Nevertheless, the author concludes
that retinoids can act both to fight infection and to
induce symptoms, with the serum vitamin D concentration being a
critical factor determining the action of retinoids (previous vitamin D
deficiency seems to determine greater toxicity of endogenous retinoids).
