The identiﬁed taxa are all first occurrences to the Parque
Estadual da Ilha do Cardoso. Besides, these results contribute to
extending the knowledge concerning the occurrence and distribution of aquatic
hyphomycetes in areas of the Atlantic Rainforest of São Paulo
State and in Brazil, introducing studies of this group in
insular areas.
