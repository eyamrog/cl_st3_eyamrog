Implementing open peer review is not straightforward, though. Different traits
of open peer review serve different editorial goals, and their
acceptability may vary from one scholarly community to the other
(Ross-Hellauer; Görögh, 2019). For example, communities traditionally adopting single-blind peer
review (medicine and natural sciences in the Global North) (Pontille;
Torny, 2014) are also those adopting open identities (Wolfram et
al., 2020), suggesting the benefit might be less obvious for
communities adopting double-blind peer review; and open participation seems more
popular in the social sciences and humanities than in the
natural sciences, technology and medicine (Ross-Hellauer, 2017).
