Incubation - In the laboratory, the leaf samples were coarsely
fragmented individually using sterile scissors to fit loosely in sterile
Petri dishes. Sterile water was added to the Petri dishes
to cover sufficiently the leaf fragments (Ingold 1975). Thus, 172
Petri dishes were obtained, which were incubated at room temperature
(around 20 oC) for 4 to 8 weeks. Whenever the
proliferation of bacteria was perceptible or the leaf fragments emerged,
aliquots of sterile water were added to the Petri dishes
or the entire water was replaced in order to keep
the substrates as clean as possible.
