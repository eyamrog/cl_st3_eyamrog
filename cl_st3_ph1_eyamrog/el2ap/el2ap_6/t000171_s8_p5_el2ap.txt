According to the Government of the State of Minas Gerais,
in its last update of the human infection protocol for
SARS-CoV-2 of July 20, both the reverse transcription assays followed
by the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the immunological techniques,
which include rapid tests, can be used as a diagnostic
criterion. It is noteworthy that negative results in rapid tests
are not able to discard suspicious cases (6).
