Corroborating concerns about the onset of these mental disorders, Batelaan
et al. (31) noted that there is evidence that anxiety
disorders increase the incidence of cardiovascular diseases by 52% and
that the severity of anxiety symptoms would be directly associated
with functional impairment (32). Supporting these findings, it is understood
that, in an attempt to preserve its homeostasis, the body
reacts with adaptive responses, mediated by neuroendocrine and neuronal defensive
activity, involving the autonomic nervous system and activation of the
Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal axis (HHA) and the release of cortisol. The functional
abnormalities of this axis alter the response to stressful events,
contributing to the developmentof anxiety disorders (33).
