From the observation and the comparison of the low results
obtained in the pre-test: 4,05 for the control group and
4,14 out of 10 points for the experimental group, it
can be said that students are demotivated when reading because
they lack tools that allow them to comprehend a text.
This information was used to propose the use of graphic
organizers to enhance their reading comprehension.
