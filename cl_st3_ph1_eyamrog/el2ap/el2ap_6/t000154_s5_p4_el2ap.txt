RBMFC stakeholders were even less supportive of open identities than
participants in Ross-Hellauer et al. (2017), and this was the
least supported trait in that survey, even though it is
considered one of the core traits of open peer review
(Ross-Hellauer, 2017). In fact, most RBMFC stakeholders believed opening identities
would make peer review worse or much worse; see Supplemental
Table 2 in (Fontenelle, 2020b). Interestingly, when confronted with statements
about the consequences of open identities, participants in both surveys
were much less dismissive. RBMFC stakeholders (including reviewers!) agreed less
than participants in Ross-Hellauer et al. (2017) that opening reviewers’
identities would inhibit them from accepting an invitation, and only
a third of RBMFC stakeholders agreed opening authors’ identities would
inhibit them from submitting. The last statement was not part
of the other survey’s questionnaire, possibly because authors’ identities are
already open in single-blind peer review.
