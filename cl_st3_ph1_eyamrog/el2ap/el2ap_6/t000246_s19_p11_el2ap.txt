For the purpose of distribution of the Nucleus and the
zones, in this study, the value proposed in the theory
was used, thus, the Nucleus and each of the two
zones, accounted for approximately 1/3 of the total number of
documents produced in the time clipping analyzed, that is, approximately
541 documents in the Nucleus, 1082 in zone 1 and
1623 in zone 2 (Table 3). The 15 journals that
compose the Nucleus have Impact Factor (IF) in the WOS:
Journal of Virology (FI = 4.324), Chinese Medical Journal (FI
= 1.555), Journal of Clinical Microbiology (FI = 4.959), Journal
of Infectious Diseases (FI = 5.045), Journal of Biological Chemistry
(FI = 4.106), Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
of the United States of America (FI = 9.58), Clinical
Infectious Diseases (FI = 9.055), Journal of General Virology (FI
= 2.809), Critical Care Medicine (FI = 6.971), Emerging Infectious
Diseases (FI = 7.185), American Journal of Respiratory and Critical
Care Medicine (FI = 16.494), Virology (FI = 2.657), American
Journal of Roentgenology (FI = 3.161), Clinical and Diagnostic Laboratory
Immunology (FI = 2.511), Intensive Care Medicine (FI = 18.967).
