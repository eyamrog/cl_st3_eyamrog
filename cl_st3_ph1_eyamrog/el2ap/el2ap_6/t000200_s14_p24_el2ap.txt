Linear regression analysis of the association between leptospirosis cases and
variations in rainfall levels was carried out for the period
and the population as a whole, according to the Health
Region. In the investigation of the temporal evolution in the
monthly occurrence of leptospirosis, the monthly incidence rates of the
disease represent the dependent variable, i.e., the outcome (y); and,
the months in the studied period, the independent variable (x).
Thus, in the proposed model, monthly variations in leptospirosis cases
are supplied by the angular coefficient (beta), from the adjustment
of linear regression, having the months in the calendar year
as dependent variable. The trend analysis applied the method of
Prais-Winsten generalized linear regression, according to Gaynor and Kirkpatrick15, in
which the regression parameters are corrected for first-order autocorrelation.
