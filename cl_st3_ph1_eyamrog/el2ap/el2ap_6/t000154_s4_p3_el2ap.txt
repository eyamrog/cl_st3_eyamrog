Always a paragon of open science, SciELO Brazil requires its
journals to implement some form of “open peer review”: consisting
of open identities, open reports, or crediting associate editors. Based
on this survey and the discussed literature, journal editors should
be extremely cautious of open identities, as most researchers believe
it would make more harm than good. If open identities
are to be adopted, scholarly journals should consider making them
optional at first, and monitor the adherence.
