The importance of adequate nutritional status to modulate the immune
response and decrease the risk of infections is well established
in the literature [8,9]. Micronutrients such as vitamin A, D,
iron, zinc, and folate, are highlighted for their participation in
several stages of the immune response, including differentiation, proliferation and
functioning of innate immune cells; regulation of cytokine; and production/development
of antibodies [8].
