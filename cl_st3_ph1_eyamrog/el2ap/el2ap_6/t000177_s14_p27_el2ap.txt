REHVA showed that flushing toilets creates plumes containing droplets, as
well as droplet residue when toilets are flushed with open
lids. SARS-CoV-2 viruses have been detected in stool samples (reported
in recent scientific papers and by the Chinese authorities). Exhaust
ventilation systems of toilets should always be kept continuously. Make
sure that under pressure is created, especially to avoid the
fecal-oral transmission; as shown in Figure.
