Why do researchers choose to publish in Zootaxa? Several reasons
influence the preference of a researcher for a specific journal.
Certainly, scope, visibility, prestige in the field, and JIF are
among the most influential criteria. It is realistic to assume
that most of the authors of Zootaxa are looking for
a journal that has fast reviewing and production processes, is
free of charge to authors (no APC), has a comparatively
high JIF, and has no limit of pages for a
manuscript. Authors and readers of the journal seem not to
be concerned about the hybrid policy of paywall for accessing
most of the published issues, with few published articles having
GOA through payment by authors (APC-OA). Among the reasons for
this complaisance are the article-processing charges for most open access
journals with values of hundreds of Euros or US Dollars,
generally excessively expensive for researchers from developing countries, the possible
economic situation of most contributors (e.g., Brazilian researchers are authors
of most papers in the journal, https://bit.ly/2Y0hSQ9), and the open
access is viable through platforms of self-archiving, such as ResearchGate,
or websites, such as Sci-Hub; the latter illegally makes paywalled
content available for free and is regarded as “piracy.” High
APC costs are clearly impeditive for researchers from most countries
and for small research groups lacking big budgets. Also, there
are certainly many other priorities for spending limited research money.
Nevertheless, open access through platforms such as Sci-Hub is deprived
of respect for the intellectual property or copyright laws and
certainly raises many moral issues. Therefore, it is at least
controversial that authors are opposed to paying fees to APC-GOA
journals and are in favor of hybrid platforms because it
is possible to break paywalls to access payment-based content.
