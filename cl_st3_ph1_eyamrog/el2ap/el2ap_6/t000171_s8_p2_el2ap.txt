The virus is transmitted by inhalation through expelled droplets and
aerosols, but also by fomites, through contaminated objects and surfaces
that provide contact with an infected carrier with the hands
and, later, with the face, eyes and nose (1, 3).
In order to contain the rampant spread of the novel
coronavirus, countries have adopted measures of social isolation (3). These
measures, which include closing international borders, have caused devastating and
long-lasting economic consequences around the world (2, 3).
