The Triatominae (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) or kissing bugs are the insect
vectors of American trypanosomiasis or Chagas disease. More than 18
million people are infected and approximately 120 million live at
risk (AÃ±ez et al. 2004). However, according to an editorial
published in The Lancet (Anonymous 2006), Chagas illness is the
most neglected of neglected human diseases.
