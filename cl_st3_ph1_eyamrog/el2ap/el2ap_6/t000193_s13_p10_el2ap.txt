The best initial treatment strategy for MS (induction Ã— escalation
therapy) is still under debate. Induction therapy is the use
of high-efficacy treatments, which leads to faster control of disease
activity24. Contrarily, traditional escalation therapy consists of prescribing safer low-efficacy
drugs, which can be later switched to more effective alternatives
in the face of clinical or radiological activity. A recent
observational study suggests that the first strategy may lead to
lower long-term disability25, which greatly favors this approach. However, these
data still need to be replicated in experimental trials (as
in the ongoing TREAT- MS and DELIVER-MS trials).
