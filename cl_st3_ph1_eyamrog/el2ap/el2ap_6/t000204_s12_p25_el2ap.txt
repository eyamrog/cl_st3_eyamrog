The multidisciplinary study of cognitive and socio-affective processes in teaching-learning
can benefit from the concept of function modularity, i.e. the
notion that motivation, attention and memory comprise a set of
skills and abilities mediated by different modules of the nervous
system, which function independently, but cooperatively, for the development of
autonomy and conduction of studies during and after the COVID-19
pandemic threat. In this follow-up, attention should also be paid
to somatisation regarding the manifestation of physical symptoms resulted from
psychological effects.
