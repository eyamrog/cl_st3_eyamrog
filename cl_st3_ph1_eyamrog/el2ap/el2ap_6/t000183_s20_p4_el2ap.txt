It has to be kept in mind that Ecuadorian teachers
face heterogeneous classes where they have to teach students with
different cultural backgrounds and different learning styles, which makes planning
a lesson that would reach everyone, rather challenging. Teachers need
to offer students different opportunities to engage in meaningful tasks
where higher order thinking skills and problem solving abilities can
be developed in real contexts, for this reason innovating our
way to teach reading showed to have a great impact
that could lead to obtaining the desired results in EFL.
