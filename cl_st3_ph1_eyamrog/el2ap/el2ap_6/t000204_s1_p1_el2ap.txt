In response to the outbreak of the novel Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), pathogen of the new coronavirus disease
(COVID-19), several sectors and social activities have been affected, including
education. At first, it is explained that educators and students
can feel fragile during and after the SARS- CoV-2 outbreak.
Subsequently, it is discussed that their relationship ought to be
carefully established given the triggering of psychological and neuropsychiatric effects
arising from neural coding and plasticity processes, which result in
the formation of positive and negative memories in the short
to long term. Finally, it is pointed out that the
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic generates a need for adequacy and adaptation for
the significant attention to studdents during the re-starting of studies,
given that possible disorders of sensory modulation and involvement of
limbic brain areas triggered in situations of risk of death,
potential or real threat, can happen. It is assumed that
at times of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in addition to preserving
life, one of the challenges is the behavioural (re)organisation, which
includes habits from the educational context that need to contemplate
a scientific perspective, seeking to transform the consequences of the
pandemic fear on opportunities to reinforcement of familiar links. In
the context of modern rationality, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is also
a period to think about the relationship between scientific knowledge
and common sense. With this logic, neurosciences can develop a
new format for the teaching-learning process, so that educators and
students experiencing the pandemic threatening do not manifest psychological distress
and secondary consequences. Therefore, education can be considered a central
space in decision-making in the face of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In
this sense, the urgency of a multidisciplinary strategies development is
highlighted, connecting the synergy between neurosciences and education after the
COVID-19 pandemic.
