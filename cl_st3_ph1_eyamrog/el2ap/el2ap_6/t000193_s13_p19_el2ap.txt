In patients with persistent MOG IgG positivity and NMOSD clinical
phenotype, we propose the same management strategy, using rituximab as
first- line treatment, at least during the COVID-19 pandemic context23.
However, we emphasize that MONEM patients may not experience the
same efficacy profile as AQP4-positive patients35.
