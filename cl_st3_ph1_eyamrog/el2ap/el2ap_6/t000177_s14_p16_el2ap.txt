Elias et al [21] showed that in hospitals that contain
HEPA filtration, localized filtering in high-traffic spaces may further decrease
the number of viral particles. A low-cost air purifier containing
a HEPA filter can cost aorund $100 and renovate the
air in a 15m2 room 5 times per hour and
could be deployed widely in hospital environments. It may be
worth taking any measures possible to increase airflow speed in
existing HVAC systems, and to avoid recirculating air between rooms.
