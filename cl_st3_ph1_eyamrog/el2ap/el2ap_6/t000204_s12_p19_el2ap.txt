In acute anxiety, the activation of the HHA axis is
adaptive. On the contrary, in chronic anxiety, this mechanism fails,
the HHA axis remains activated and impairs coping mechanisms, in
addition to inducing low tolerance to chronic stress (34). Chronic
stress, on the other hand, has consequences for cognitive and
emotional processing and is associated with changes in brain plasticity,
can affect the immune system, increase the risk for developmental
diseases, impairment of negative feedback from the HHA axis, decrease
in neurotrophic factors, among others (34). Thus, the literature already
has robust evidence of a role played by stress in
the development of psychiatric disorders in both laboratory animal (35)
and in human experimental models (36), in addition to contributing
to the appearance or worsening of clinical conditions.
