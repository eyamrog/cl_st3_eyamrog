We are confident that a journal can publish high-quality, robust
science regardless of its level of self-citation. There is not
necessarily any relationship between the rate of journal-level self-citation and
the quality of the research published in a journal, particularly
in the case of high output journals such as Zootaxa.
Clarivate appears to want to promote a sense of competition
among journals, so that it can sell its journal ranking
data and analytics â€“ clearly, zoological taxonomists and their publishing
and citing behaviors do not fit the model that Clarivate
seemingly wants to promote. Who is wrong here? The community
of scientists producing taxonomic science for which they were specifically
trained to, or the profit-driven analytics company that appears to
know nothing about taxonomy and yet still wants to rank
and supposedly provide sound judgement on the quality of taxonomic
journals? We think of course that the scientific community knows
best, whereas Clarivate appears to know or care very little
about robust science.
