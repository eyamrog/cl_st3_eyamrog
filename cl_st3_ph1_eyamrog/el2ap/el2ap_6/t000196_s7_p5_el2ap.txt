It is worth mentioning that the more precarious a child's
food situation is, that is, the more vulnerable the family
structure is to supplying basic needs, the greater the importance
of school [5] for filling this deficiency. In addition, in
situations of social vulnerability, school meals constitute an indirect income
for families, and this can contribute to overall family income.
