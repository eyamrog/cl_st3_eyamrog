The investigation of the association between leptospirosis rates and the
regional dimension, although heterogeneous, identified a relationship between the incidence
of the disease and the rainfall variation. The current study
highlights that the distribution of cases in Santa Catarina, over
the period examined (2005â€“2015), was related to the regions that
had the largest volumes of rains and floods. The annual
precipitation records14 support these results. The floods that occurred in
the years 2008 and 2011 coincided with the highest incidence
rates of the disease in the period. Costa et al.16
found a higher incidence of the disease in flood areas,
given that the countries located in the tropics were responsible
for 73% of estimated cases of leptospirosis in the world.
Pelissari et al.11, in a systematic review, identified seven studies
conducted in Brazil, which associated the occurrence of leptospirosis with
rain and/or flooding.
