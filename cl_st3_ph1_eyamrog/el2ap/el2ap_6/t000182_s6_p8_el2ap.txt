This suggest that kleptophagy is an ethological (i.e. taxonomic, phylogenetic
and evolutionary) characteristic of Belminus as well as of Triatominae.
Since, Belminus are not strict hematophagous, this trait might deserve
taxonomic revision. We propose to consider kleptophagy as an attribute
that groups triatomines. Kleptophagy is a non-aggressive behavior which contrast
with the violent predatory behaviors that characterize ancestral reduviids.
