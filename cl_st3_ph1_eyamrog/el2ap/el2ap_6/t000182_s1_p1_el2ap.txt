Most triatomine bugs (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Triatominae) are hematophagous, though Belminus
species can live off of cockroach hemolymph to complete their
life cycle. In this work we described the fixed action
pattern (FAP) employed by B. ferroae to identify, approach and
suck on a living cockroach. The FAP described here is
composed of the following stereotyped behaviors: 1) visual and/or olfactory
detection of the cockroach, 2) reaching, 3) cautious approach, 4)
antennal exploration, 5) extension of the proboscis, 3) piercing to
sedate, 5) walking away and waiting (post sedation behavior), 6)
second cautious approach, 7) extension of the proboscis, 8) piercing
to suck hemolymph. In order to identify chemicals cues that
could elicit such FAP, we examined the behavior of B.
corredori, B. ferroae and B. herreri in response to the
cockroaches’ odor, fresh cockroach feces and fresh rodent wastes. The
last two sources were tested based on the assumption that
abundant chemicals near host refuges could serve as cues for
host orientation. We found the cockroach odor emanating from a
box significantly attracted B. herreri in a still air olfactometer.
The three Belminus species approached the captive cockroach after one
hour, but avoided to climb the box. Odors emanating from
the cockroach feces attracted B. corredori and B. ferroae in
a Y-olfactometer. The FAP sequence observed suggests Belminus bugs are
not predators like the rest of reduviids (assassin bugs) —but
are kleptophagous ectoparasites, since they do not attack and kill
a prey but rather steal hemolymph from its invertebrate host.
Triatomines and their hosts have intimately shared the same refuge
for millions of years. Similar odors occur across invertebrate and
vertebrate refuges, and are recurrent in human abodes, thus plausibly
explaining how these kleptophagous bugs can readily switch to the
domestic habitat.
