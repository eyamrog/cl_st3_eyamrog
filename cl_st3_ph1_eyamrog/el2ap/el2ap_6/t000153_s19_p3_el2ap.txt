The Network of professionals was created at the end of
2014. It is an interdisciplinary space, including gynecologists and obstetricians,
clinical doctors, nurses, social workers and psychologists who work in
the public sphere. The interdisciplinarity of the space constitutes a
positive aspect, since it does not cast abortion as the
specific field of interest or action of one area of
specialization only; instead, interdisciplinarity involves, and at the same time
makes visible, the role played by all specialists who can
make up a health team. The diversity of specializations prevents
professionals with less accumulated symbolic capital than others (for example,
psychologists, social workers, and nurses) from suffering greater stigmatization due
to their becoming involved in the abortion itinerary. The symbolic
capital ought to be understood as “the form that the
different types of capital take when they are perceived and
recognized as legitimate” (Costa 2015, p.2), something which positions those
who possess it at an advantage. Inside the Network, a
considerable number of general practitioners stand out, whose training as
specialists in community health defines their work at the first
level of healthcare. Because of their role, they focus on
preventive actions, oriented to promoting health within the framework of
the Primary Healthcare Service Program (APS is its acronym in
Spanish). Currently, a large number of non-punishable abortions are performed
at this primary level of care, by means of the
use of misoprostol in an ambulatory manner (Amnesty International 2017).
