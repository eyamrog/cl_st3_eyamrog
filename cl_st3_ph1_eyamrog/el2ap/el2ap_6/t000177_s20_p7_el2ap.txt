We all have a role to play to control the
spread of this disease. HVAC is part of it and
even more significant are social distancing, hygiene and the influence
we can have on personal behavior. Ryan et al. [26]
showed that the eUVGI decreased HVAC microbial colonization and it
was associated with reduced neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) environment
and tracheal microbial colonization [20, 26].
