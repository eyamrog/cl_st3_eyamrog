The number of studies that have evaluated measurement invariance in
job satisfaction scales is limited, so very few instruments have
enough evidence to justify making comparisons between groups. However, the
practice of making comparisons between groups is very common, even
when there is not enough evidence to carry out this
analysis. This could end in biased results if invariance is
violated (29). One study identified that invariance was achieved by
comparing the outcomes of physicians and nurses from 14 European
countries, suggesting that cultural factors allow different organizational variables to
be assessed in these professionals over time (43). Our study
tested measure invariance of the scales and, therefore, allows comparisons
between different groups such as marital status, whether they have
occupational or chronic diseases. In addition, for the working conditions
and health center management scales, further comparisons can be made
between men and women, age groups, whether they have a
specialty, whether they work in another institution, and between the
time of service. Based on our findings, all these comparisons
are free of measurement bias (29).
