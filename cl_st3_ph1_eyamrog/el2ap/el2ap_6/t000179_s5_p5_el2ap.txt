Our three instruments allow us to collect information on different
aspects of job satisfaction in physicians, considering the peculiarities of
the health system in a middle- income country. For example,
our scale on general professional activity evaluates the availability of
physicians to work as care staff in other institutions (item
c2p82_3), since in Peru about half of the physicians work
in more than one institution. On the other hand, in
the Health Services Management scale included items that assess satisfaction
with how the rotating shifts are managed (item c2p83_5) and
with drug management (item c2p83_2). It should be noted that
we have not identified any other scale in the literature
that assesses satisfaction with how health centres are managed. Finally,
our working conditions scale allows us to assess satisfaction with
your position in your institution (item c2p81_6) and with basic
services such as water or drainage (item c2p81_11).
