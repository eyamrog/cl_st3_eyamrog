As mentioned before, Latin American countries generally have low reading
levels. This has caught the attention of the Ecuadorian government
that has tried to come up with ideas to foster
reading and improve the levels of comprehension of texts in
our country. One of those ideas is Fiesta de la
Lectura, which is a national plan that proposes a 30-minute
period during class in specific days, which is dedicated to
promote reading in schools addressing issues and combining reading with
recreational activities (Ministerio de Educaci√≥n 2018).
