Self-citation phenomena, either of author or journal types, have been
deeply investigated from various perspectives, including sociological and bibliometric aspects.
A review focused on author self- citation and all its
technical nuances was presented by Szomszor et al. (2020). Generally,
high levels of self- citation are condemned, particularly when journal
self-citation is interpreted as the result of manipulation for boosting
indexes; in these situations, it has of course been determined
that the biased metrics should not be considered for analyses
of influence or impact (Ioannidis & Thombs 2019). However, self-citation
can be legitimate in certain circumstances (Chorus & Waltman 2016).
Consequently, levels of self-citation are not easy to analyze. Ioannidis
& Thombs (2019) argued that these levels naturally vary, and
high levels may be justifiable in highly specialized journals or
in disciplines with few available journals.
