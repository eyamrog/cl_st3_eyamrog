Transition rates and productivity of authors provide interesting data; the
number of occasional or transient authors is lower in disciplines
where scientific activity is well established, which means that a
high transition rate reflects the lack of relevant working groups,
although it may also indicate the presence of researchers from
other scientific areas. A transience index of 70.81% was obtained,
and from highly productive authors 1.16% was very close to
the study on obstetrics 13, whose values are, respectively, 71.5%
and 1.33% of the total.
