Table 5 presents the results of the comparison between groups
3.1 and 3.2. Similarly to what is observed in Table
4, it is possible to observe that there is evidence
of a statistical difference between the accelerations in the last
30 days for both cases (p = 0.003) and deaths
(p = 0.001), and the mean and median values of
acceleration are higher in group 3.1 in relation to group
3.2. Regarding the comparisons of the acceleration up to April
11 in group 3.1 vs. acceleration up to May 11
in group 3.2, a difference was identified only for the
acceleration of deaths (p = 0.001), and the acceleration of
group 3.1 is higher than that of group 3.2.
