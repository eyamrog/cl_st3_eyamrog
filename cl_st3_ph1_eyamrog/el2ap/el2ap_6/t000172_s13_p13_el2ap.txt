Coronaviruses nsp6 is known to interfere with autophagy, limiting the
autophagosomes diameter at the point of omegasome formation, which may
favor viral infection by compromising the ability of the autophagy
system to degrade viral components via lysosomes (Cottam et al.
2014). Another study reported that the coronavirus endoribonuclease nsp15 is
required for evasion of dsRNA sensors and apoptosis since the
loss of nsp15 activity is related to attenuation of the
disease in mice and stimulated a protective immune response (Deng
et al. 2017). Nsp16 can downregulate the activities of RIG-I
and MDA5, inhibiting innate immunity to promote viral proliferation (Shi
et al. 2019).
