For instance, high schoolers who attend Unidad Educativa Joaquin Lalama
have showed to feel demotivated when reading in either Spanish
or English due to the lack of the strategies needed
to understand texts effectively. Thus, how can we help students
become readers that are more effective? Are we using the
right strategies when we teach reading? Worldwide, teachers are probably
wondering the same and exploring different options; for example, Wong
(2019) implemented a 14-week syllabus that incorporated practice on recognizing
discourse structures and using graphic organizers in an EFL class.
