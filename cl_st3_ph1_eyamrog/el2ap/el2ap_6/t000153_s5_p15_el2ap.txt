“I really know that it is not that I am
better or more tolerant, or whatever; what I know is
that access to abortion is a right, guaranteed by law,
and that women must have such access safeguarded. My job
is simply a medium so that women find a solution
to a problem, which the State is obliged to solve”
(M. male, OB/GYN doctor. Interview, Córdoba, October 2018).
