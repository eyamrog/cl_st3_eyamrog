The survey was anonymous and there was no information in
the database that could lead to participants identification. Hence, conducting
this analysis did not represent an ethical hazard since there
was no access to confidential data. Two authors (LBB and
EMH) participated in the design process of the three scales
at the time the survey was being designed.
