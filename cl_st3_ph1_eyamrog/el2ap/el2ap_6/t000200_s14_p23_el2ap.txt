Exploratory analysis of monthly trends over the period detected the
existence of a pattern with two distinct seasonal periods, the
first (from April to September) with low rainfall levels and
the second (from October to March) with higher rainfall levels.
Thus, the investigation of temporal associations between exposure (rain) and
outcome (leptospirosis) in the present analysis, in addition to the
monthly evolution in the period as a whole, focused on
the existence of two distinct seasonal periods.
