A study published by a group of researchers from the
United Kingdom already predicted different scenarios of the pandemic in
202 countries, until the epidemiological week ending on April 26,
2020, when it proposed three possible models regarding mitigation strategies:
(1) without any interventionsâ€™ mitigation, that is, without non- pharmacological
intervention, without social distance and others; (2) with social distance
from the entire population; and (3) with improved social distance
for the elderly. According to the adopted mitigation strategy, estimates
for the total number of infected people in Brazil would
be 187,799,806, 122,025,818, and 120,836,850 cases, respectively. As for the
number of deaths from COVID-19, the respectively forecast was 1,152,283
for the first condition, 627,047 for the second, and 529,779
for the third condition. The mentioned report concluded that measures
such as social isolation, school closures and services considered non-essential,
among others, can save million lives.3
