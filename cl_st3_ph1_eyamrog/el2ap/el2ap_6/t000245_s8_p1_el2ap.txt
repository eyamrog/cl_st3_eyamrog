Proposed in 1948, the family Ganodermataceae (Donk) Donk has approximately
220 species described, distributed into seven genera (Amauroderma Murrill, Foraminispora
Robledo, Costa-Rezende & Drechsler- Santos, Furtadoa Costa-Rezende, Robledo & Drechsler-Santos,
Ganoderma P. Karst., Haddowia Steyaert, Humphreya Steyaert and Tomophagus Murrill)
(Ryvarden 2004, Kirk et al. 2008, Costa- Rezende et al.
2017). Considered cosmopolitan, the family has as a distinct characteristic
the presence of double-walled basidiospores, with the inner wall thick
and ornamented and the outer smooth, distinguishing it from other
polyporoid groups. The basidiospore can be found in globular and
ellipsoid shapes with pigmentation (Gilbertson & Ryvarden 1986, Ryvarden 2004,
Cannon & Kirk 2007). Thus, these characteristics, as well as
the hardness of the pileus, are essential for the identification
of Ganodermataceae species (Ryvarden 2004, Gugliotta et al. 2011).
