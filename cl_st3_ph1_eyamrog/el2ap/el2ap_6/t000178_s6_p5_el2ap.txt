We agree with several members of the scientific community that
in order to improve the quality of science: transparency, reproducibility,
efficiency, and benefits to society, there is a need for
open data (Molloy, 2013). Public databases play a big role
in open science and reproducibility. Thus, the availability of sequencing
data in this platform is crucial for scientific research and
should be practiced and encouraged. In addition, we believe in
the necessity of a national genome sequencing plan developed by
public and private research institutions. This will increase the Peruvian
genetic information in public databases, articulate efforts and promote networking
from different institutions, and provide resources to manage several issues
from several topics such as agriculture, public health and biodiversity
conservation. Finally, efforts should be also focused on a country-wide
capacity building initiative to train a new generation of Peruvian
bioinformaticians that will be essential in future challenges to our
biodiversity.
