After the WHO declared the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal University
of Para√≠ba suspended all on-site teaching, research, and service activities.
For the return to teaching activities, the use of information
and communications technology (ICTs) resources for distance learning was recommended,
with the following considerations: 1) student access to the internet
and computers; 2) training of teachers to use ICTs; 3)
theoretical and practical nature of the curricular components. Remote teaching
of theoretical curricular components was offered in all undergraduate programs;
however, these were considered as a supplementary semester. Assessments were
submitted online in a range of formats such as quizzes,
essays, and video production. When returning to face-to-face activities, considering
that some students do not have a satisfactory socioeconomic condition
that supports the use of ICTs, the online curricular components
offered must be made available again in the face to
face classrooms.
