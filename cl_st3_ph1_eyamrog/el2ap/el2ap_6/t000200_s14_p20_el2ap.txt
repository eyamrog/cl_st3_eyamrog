The information collected consists of data on leptospirosis and rainfall
rates for Santa Catarina State, from 2005 to 2015. The
sample, based on a series of 11 years, ensures data
representativeness. The information survey on confirmed cases of leptospirosis was
acquired from the restricted access database of the Board of
Epidemiological Surveillance (Diretoria de Vigilância Epidemiológica — DIVE) of Santa
Catarina. The rainfall data, or the precipitation in millimeters, of
each of the municipalities that comprise each of the Health
Regions of Santa Catarina were obtained from the National Water
Agency (Agência Nacional de Águas — ANA) and the Company
of Agricultural Research and Rural Extension of Santa Catarina (Empresa
de Pesquisa Agropecuária e Extensão Rural de Santa Catarina/Centro de
Informações de Recursos Ambientais e de Hidrometereologia de Santa Catarina
— EPAGRI/CIRAM). Recorded daily precipitation data were obtained from 155
rainfall stations, distributed throughout Santa Catarina, from 2005 to 2015.
From these data, the average monthly precipitation by municipality, by
Health Regions, and for Santa Catarina were calculated. Data regarding
the current population of Santa Catarina and the respective Health
Regions were obtained from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and
Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística — IBGE) website.
