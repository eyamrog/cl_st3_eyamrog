To evaluate the factor structures we used three different criteria.
First, items factor loadings should be equal to or greater
than 0.40 (20). Second, if a scale has more than
one dimension, each dimension must have at least three items
to be considered stable (25). Third, if an item loads
in more than one dimension and the difference of loading
between them is lower than 0.020, the item will be
deleted. However, if the difference in loadings is equal to
or greater than 0.20, then the item will be included
in the dimension that has the highest factor load (20).
