Studies are needed that compare Peruvian regions according to different
areas of job satisfaction (an objective that is beyond the
scope of this study). Also, it is necessary to identify
a gold standard of job satisfaction as it would allow
for sensitivity and specificity studies. It is suggested to be
able to evaluate the measurement properties of the three scales
presented in other contexts, for which we attach in supplement
1 and 2, the Spanish and English versions, respectively. In
particular, the psychometric properties of the English version need to
be evaluated, since this is only one proposal of the
authors.
