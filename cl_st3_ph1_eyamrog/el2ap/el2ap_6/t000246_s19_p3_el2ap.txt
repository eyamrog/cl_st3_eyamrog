There were 7,304 researchers among authors and co-authors. The average
productivity was little more than 1.73. The most productive authors/co-authors
published 43 articles (2.64%), while the absolute majority, 5,172 (70.81%)
published a single article. To identify productivity patterns among authors,
Lotka's Law was applied, based on the equation xÎ± .
y = c, where x = number of documents published,
y = number of authors with x publications and c
= constant. Figure 2 represents the equation from the distribution
of articles by the number of authors, whose Lotka constant
was 0,8101X-2,581. The Law of Elitism 3-4 was confirmed from
the production of the group of 85 (1.16%) authors/co-authors, whose
contribution was 1236 (76.15%) of articles.
