In extreme cases, these mental health problems can lead to
suicidal behaviour. It is well established that about 90% of
global suicides are due to mental disorders such as depression
(37). Based on these findings and experience in previous pandemics,
such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) in 2003
when the suicide rate among the elderly increased in Hong
Kong during and after the pandemic (38, 39), the present
issue is relevant and must be considered with due seriousness.
