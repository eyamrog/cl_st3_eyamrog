The M protein presents three transmembrane domains and is responsible
for the shape of virions, promoting the membrane curvature and
binding to the nucleocapsid (Neuman et al. 2011). It is
the most abundant structural protein in the virion, having approximately
25â€“30 kDa and presenting a small glycosylated ectodomain at the
N- terminal and a larger C-terminal endodomain that extends from
6 to 8 nm in the viral particle (Nal et
al. 2005). M protein forms a dimer in the virion
and can adopt two different conformations, interacting with nucleocapsid N
protein and S protein (Neuman et al. 2011). The interaction
with the nucleocapsid N protein promotes the complete assembly of
the virion and was mapped to occur between the C-terminal
of the M protein endodomain and the N protein CTD
(Hurst et al. 2005). As already reported, its interaction with
protein E has also been demonstrated (Chen et al. 2009a).
M protein directs most of the protein-protein interactions necessary for
the assembly of coronaviruses. A study showed that the expression
of M protein alone is not sufficient for the formation
of virus-like particles (VLPs) (Bos et al. 1996). However, when
M protein was expressed together with E protein, the formation
of VLPs occurred, suggesting the important role of the two
proteins in producing the envelopes of coronaviruses. A study showed
that the surface proteins of coronaviruses S, M, and E
show differential subcellular locations when expressed alone, suggesting that additional
cellular or viral factors may be necessary for coordinated traffic
to the viral assembly site in the ERGIC (Nal et
al. 2005).
