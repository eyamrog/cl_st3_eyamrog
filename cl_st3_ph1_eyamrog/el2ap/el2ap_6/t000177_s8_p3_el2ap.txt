Protecting health care workers and preparedness of Intensive care units
(ICUs) to face an epidemic cluster should be the main
priority. The role of healthcare workers in the transmission of
pathogens from patient-to-patient is well documented, however, increasing evidence reports
the contaminated environment as highly significant in pathogen transmission; in
particular, high-touch surfaces are recognized as a possible reservoir of
infectious agents. Thus, healthcare workers are at increased risk for
infection [4, 5, 6].
