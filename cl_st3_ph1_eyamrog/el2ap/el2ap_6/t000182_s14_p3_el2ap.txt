Arena 1: Ethological responses of B. ferroae were examined in
a 10 cm Petri dish made of glass, where a
3-cm living B. giganteus nymph was enclosed with a B.
ferroae bug (Fig 1Ai). Phase I: In the first part
of the experiment the cockroach was confined in a 5.8
cm plate tight to the center of the arena with
a low odor thermoplastic adhesive (tec bond 341, HotMelt), to
avoid odor escaping from around the lid. Thus, only visual
contact was allowed between the cockroach and the bug. The
location and behavior of the cockroach and the triatomine were
recorded for 10 minutes. Phase II: The cockroach was released,
so both individuals could physically interact for 10 additional minutes.
Controls: These consisted of a second series of two bioassays
in which either the cockroach or the bug were absent.
Each experiment was repeated 10 times.
