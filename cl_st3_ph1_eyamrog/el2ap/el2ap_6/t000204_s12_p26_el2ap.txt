Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurobiological condition of
genetic and environmental influences, which can set in early development
(period inside the womb). It is characterised by a behaviour
that goes to the extreme of inattention, restlessness and impulsiveness
in a level that would not be expected for more
advanced stages of the child development. That disorder can affect
the person during adulthood (45). ADHD affects 5.3% of children
and adolescents and 2.5% of adults, worldwide (46). The occurrence
of that disorder increases the death rate, school difficulties and
drug abuse, in addition to worsening job placement (45).
