In line with Ross-Hellauer et al. (2017), most RBMFC readers,
authors, and reviewers did not agree manuscripts should be made
freely available before peer review, and most authors and reviewers
did not believe preprints would improve peer review. Such lack
of enthusiasm contrasts with the proliferation of preprint servers in
the last year, such as bioRxiv, medRxiv, OSF Preprints, SciELO
Preprints and EmeRI (Emerging Research Information), and because RBMFC did
not receive a single protest when the journal started to
explicitly accept manuscripts already available as preprints, in December 2018.
One explanation might be that authors have no intention of
depositing their own manuscripts in preprint servers, but do not
object to other authors doing so.
