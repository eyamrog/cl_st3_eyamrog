Leptospirosis is a widespread and prevalent seasonal zoonotic disease caused
by pathogenic spirochetes of the genus Leptospira. The incidence of
the disease, according to the World Health Organization, is higher
in countries with tropical climate1. It is among the most
common diseases transmitted to humans by animals2,3, especially by rodents,
but also by cattle, swine, dogs, horses, sheep, and goats,
being ubiquitous and poorly diagnosed. Once infected, the animals may
release the organisms in their urine, contaminating the environment, in
particular water. Human spread occurs due to exposure to contaminated
animal urine, contaminated water or soil, or infected animal tissue
through cuts or abraded skin, mucous membranes, or conjunctiva. It
is recognized as an occupational illness (rice farmers, abattoir and
sewer workers, pet traders, veterinarians, laboratory and military personnel) both
in developed and developing countries, common in urban areas, and
is often associated with a lack of local basic sanitary
conditions4-6.
