During the evaluation of learning skills, students from the control
group obtained 4,05 and the experimental group 4,17 in the
pre-test, which suggested that studentsâ€™ learning skills such as decoding
and understanding new vocabulary are rather poor. After implementing the
use of graphic organizers to enhance reading comprehension, there was
no significant change in the results obtained by the control
group. Actually, results slightly decreased. Table 4 also shows that
results were better for the experimental group in the post-test:
6,57 out of 10, which means that graphic organizers also
influenced positively the development of learning skills.
