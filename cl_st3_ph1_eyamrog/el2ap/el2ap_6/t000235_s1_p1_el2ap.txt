The full spectrum of COVID-19 is still emerging, although several
studies have highlighted that patients infected with the novel coronavirus
can potentially develop a hypercoagulable state. However, several aspects related
to the incidence and pathophysiology of the association between COVID-19
and pulmonary embolism are not well established. Here, we present
a case of a patient with COVID-19 who developed acute
pulmonary embolism. Clinical and laboratory data and findings of non-enhanced
CT indicate possibility of acute pulmonary embolism, and support the
decision to proceed with computed tomography pulmonary angiography that can
objectively identify filling defects in pulmonary arterial branches.
