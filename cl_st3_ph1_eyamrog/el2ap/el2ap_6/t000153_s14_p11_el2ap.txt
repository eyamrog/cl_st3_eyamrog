Recent proposals also put forth that it is essential to
describe the impact that the categories that are evidenced have,
at a structural level, on the definition of the time
when a person suffers, or is afraid of suffering, from
stigma. This means that it is necessary to point out
how an individualâ€™s stigma is influenced by the crisscrossing of
such categories as race/ethnicity, class, gender, age, among other multiple
identities (Collins, Von Unger, Armbrister 2008).
