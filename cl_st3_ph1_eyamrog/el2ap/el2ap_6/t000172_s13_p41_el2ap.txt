Metronidazole is a redox-active prodrug that reduces the levels of
pro- inflammatory cytokines, increases circulating lymphocytes, and decreases ROS produced
by neutrophils and has also been suggested for the treatment
of COVID-19 (Gharebaghi et al. 2020). Another class of anti-inflammatory
drugs is the Statins, and they have been included in
some treatment protocols. However, as Statins also modulate TLR response,
the use of Statins in animal experiments against SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV resulted in increased viral load, severe lung damage, and
death (Dashti-Khavidaki and Khalili 2020). Nitazoxanide is used against protozoan
and helminthic infection. Tizoxanide, the active form of nitazoxanide inhibits
16 strains of Influenza A and one strain of Influenza
B, rotavirus, HCV, Yellow fever virus, HBV, HIV, norovirus, and
others (Rossignol 2014). Nitazoxanide reduces the viral load from different
coronaviruses (Cao et al. 2015) and suppresses IL-6 production in
mice (Hong et al. 2012), being suggested for COVID-19 treatment.
