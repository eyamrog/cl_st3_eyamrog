The control group results as following: Reading Comprehension Z= -4,292
(a) with a p=0,000. Keeping in mind that Z values
are negative and p values are less than 0,05, it
can be deduced that the results obtained in the pre-test
and post-test in the experimental and control groups present significant
differences. Therefore, it can be stated that the use of
graphic organizers to enhance students reading comprehension is effective. Although
both groups present considerable differences, we cannot affirm that the
improvement presented in reading comprehension is due only to the
use of this strategy.
