In addition to UVC, there are other methods that can
be used for that objective, such as the use of
Ozone (O3) and the Advanced Oxidation processes. The first, stands
out for its high oxidative capacity (2.07 mV), making it
an excellent sanitizer capable of inactivating several pathogenic microorganisms [27,
28, 29]. However, both the World Health Organization (WHO) and
the Brazilian National Environment Council (Conselho Nacional do Meio Ambiente
- CONAMA) regulate the maximum concentrations of this molecule, because
when at high levels, it is associated with several respiratory
problems [30, 31]. As for the Advanced Oxidation processes, also
called Active Oxidation, the PHI (Photo Hydro Ionization) cells must
be highlighted. Its operation occurs through high intensity UV lamps
directed and positioned inside the equipment or in the insufflation
ducts. This luminous medium when in contact with a specific
metallic mesh results in the formation of Hydrogen Peroxides (H2O2),
hydroxides, superoxide ions and ozone ions in low concentration [32,
33]. Thus, these chemical by-products interact with the microorganisms present
in the air and on the surface, inactivating them and
purifying the environment [34]. Therefore, both processes are efficient in
fighting pathogens.
