Patients with severe COVID-19 are susceptible to developing neurological complications,
including acute cerebrovascular diseases, impaired consciousness, seizures, encephalopathy, and skeletal
muscle injury. These complications could appear after respiratory symptoms and
may be mediated by exacerbated immunological response. Immune damage and
prothrombotic states associated with cytokine storm in COVID-19 might explain
some neurological symptoms. In fact, it may be responsible for
activating glial cells with subsequent demyelination. Furthermore, anecdotal cases of
CNS demyelinating events after SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described69,70. Whether
SARS-CoV-2 is associated with post-infectious inflammatory demyelinating events is still
under debate71.
