The stratification of the results, in accordance with the eight
regions and the highest rates of leptospirosis and the highest
cases-rainfall ratio, pointed out not only to the influence of
rainfall levels in the rates of leptospirosis, represented by the
two seasonal periods, in the occurrence of new cases of
the disease. It is also observed, importantly, the cumulative effect
of rainfall on the incidence of the disease. This situation
is illustrated when comparing the ratio of new cases by
rainfall, linearly following the growth rates for the eight regions
with higher rainfall and leptospirosis rates (r = 0.91; p
= 0.013), in contrast to the same ratio among the
eight regions, with less high rainfall and lower rates of
leptospirosis, where this relationship was not observed (r = 0.24;
p = 0.644).
