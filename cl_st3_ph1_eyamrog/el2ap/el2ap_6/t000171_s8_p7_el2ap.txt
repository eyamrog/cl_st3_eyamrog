Thus, the aim of this study was to elaborate a
temporal and geographical analysis of the data regarding the number
of both rapid and RT-PCR tests performed, the incidence and
mortality, in order to better understand the epidemiology of COVID-19
in the state of Minas Gerais and the dynamics of
the use of diagnostic tests. The comprehension of these epidemiological
phenomena according to the proposed prism can elucidate questions on
which regions are most vulnerable and prepare health institutions to
deal with the logistics of tests and health equipment, hence
improving the management of the COVID-19 pandemic.
