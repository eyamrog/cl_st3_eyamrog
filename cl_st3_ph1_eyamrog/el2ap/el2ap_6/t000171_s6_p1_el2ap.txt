The highest concentrations of COVID-19 cases accumulate in the hierarchically
most influential regions of the state of Minas Gerais (9,
10). The health macro-regions Central, Southeast, Northern Triangle, Vale do
Aço and South were responsible for just over 73% of
all cases of the infectious disease in the state until
the date of analysis. All of these five regions contain
at least one city of great relevance, being the metropolis
or strong regional and sub-regional centers (9), with the exception
of Vale do Aço, which is adjacent to the Central
region and where it was notified the first case of
COVID-19 in the state.
