In intubated patients without SARS, there is a lack of
data on the risk-benefit ratio of empirical anticoagulation strategies. The
use of anticoagulation in doses lower than the full dose
but higher than the prophylactic dose in patients with SARS
was considered based on a previous experience of the team
during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, but this strategy has not
been tested in the current situation7.
