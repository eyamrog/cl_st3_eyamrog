On a bioecological approach, previous research on pandemics has revealed
a profound and wide range of psychosocial impacts on people
during outbreaks of the infection. On a micro level, people
are likely to experience fear of falling sick or dying
themselves, feelings of helplessness, and stigma (Wang et al. 2020),
health threats to oneself and loved ones, and higher chances
of being afflicted by mood swings, depression, irritability, anxiety, fear,
anger, insomnia, changes in appetite or subjective well-being (Abad, Da
Silva, das Neves Braga, Medeiros, De Freitas, Coimbra & Da
Silva, 2020).
