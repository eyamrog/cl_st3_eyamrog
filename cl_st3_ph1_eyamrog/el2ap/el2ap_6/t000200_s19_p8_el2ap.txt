Results of the linear regression stratified by Health Region showed
a trend of increasing rates of disease associated with the
volume of rainfall for the period with higher rainfall indexes
(October to March) for all regions, regardless of the magnitude
of the average rates of leptospirosis. In the period (2005–2015),
disease rates ranged from 0.93 cases/100,000 inhabitants in Serra Catarinense
to 19.82/100,000 in the Northeast region. Correlations among rates of
leptospirosis and rainfall volume (r > 0.80) accompanied by their
explanatory powers (R2) were found in this period in the
Northeast, the Far West, Grande Florianópolis, Laguna, Alto Uruguai, Carbonífera,
Midwest, and Serra Catarinense regions.
