In a system full of anachronisms, in which traditional journals
supported by museums or scientific societies are struggling to survive
and the scientific publishing industry is led by giant publishers
such as John Wiley & Sons, Elsevier, and Springer Nature,
among others with profit margins comparable to those of major
players in drug, bank, and auto companies (Larivière et al.
2015), it is at least curious to perceive the commotion
around the suppression of Zootaxa. We became intrigued and thus
decided to provide some reflections aiming to shed light on
underlying aspects of this issue. We believe that many of
the arguments that were given in the supporting letters are
based on misunderstandings about these metrics or are biased by
personal interests due to the pressure to publish in high-impact
journals. In addition, some points are also potentially misplaced. Bibliometric
data are plagued by myths and misunderstandings (Glänzel 2008).
