Based on the above-mentioned, our objective was to evaluate the
evidence of validity and reliability of a set of scales
on different areas of job satisfaction (general professional activity, health
services management, and working conditions) in Peruvian physicians based on
data from the National Survey of Satisfaction of Users in
Health (ENSUSALUD). Our results could contribute to measurement improvement in
relation to physicianÂ´s job satisfaction in Peru. It could also
serve as baseline information for the development of public policies
in the area of human resources in healthcare.
