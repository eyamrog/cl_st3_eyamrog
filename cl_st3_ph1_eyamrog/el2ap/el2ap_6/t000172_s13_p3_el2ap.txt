Once produced, the pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins undergo proteolytic cleavage,
forming a total of 16 proteins, detailed in table 1
and outlined in figure 1. The cleavage is made by
2 proteases, nsp3 which is a Papain-like protease (PLpro) and
nsp5 which is a 3C-like protease (3CLpro). Nsp3 cleaves the
sites between nsp2 to nsp4, generating, therefore, nsp1, nsp2, and
nsp3. On the other hand, nsp5 cleaves the other sites
generating the other non-structural proteins (Ziebuhr et al. 2000; BÃ¡ez-Santos
et al. 2015).
