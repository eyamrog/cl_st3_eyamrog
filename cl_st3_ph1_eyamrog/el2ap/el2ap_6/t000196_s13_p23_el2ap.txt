In Brazil, the family health community agent (currently more than
200,000) is very common, whose role is to assist the
poorest communities with the objective of promoting health surveillance, primary
care and community health [21]. During this pandemic, these agents
could monitor families and, regarding children and adolescents, contribute to
the monitoring, not only of their health, but also of
food intake. This monitoring could employ the use of telemedicine,
and involve the following actors: families, schools, government, and health
agents (Figure 2). The latter can be replaced by another
actor, to be defined by the government, to fulfill this
role.
