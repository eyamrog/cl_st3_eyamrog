Peer review became a core feature of journal publishing in
the second half of the 20th century, amidst other significant
transformations of scholarly communication (Baldwin, 2018; Tennant et al., 2017;
Zuckerman; Merton, 1971). In this now-called traditional form of peer
review, editors elicit reports from reviewers of their choice to
improve the authors’ manuscripts and inform the editors’ decisions; the
whole process is concealed from the public. Peer review is
usually double-blind, that is, authors’ and reviewers’ identities are concealed
from each other. Single-blind peer review, where reviewers know the
authors’ identities, is usual for journals from the Global North
on natural sciences and medicine (Pontille; Torny, 2014).
