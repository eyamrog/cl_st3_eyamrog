We hypothesize that the abrupt change in the rising trend
observed around April 5th can be attributed to the Social
Distancing measures adopted by São Paulo State between March 16th
and March 22nd. In this period, state decrees were issued,
establishing a system of work-from-home and the mandatory closure of
non-emergency businesses and educa­ tional institutions throughout the state. The
time delay, of around 17 days, is consistent with observations
of the delay between the onset of symptoms and death
as an outcome, found to be 17.8 days on average10.
