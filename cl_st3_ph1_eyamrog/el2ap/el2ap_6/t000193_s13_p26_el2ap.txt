Cladribine is an immunosuppressive agent used as induction therapy in
MS patients. It has a preferential lymphocyte depletion that reaches
its nadir one month after the last administered dose and
is further intensified after the second cycle48. At that time,
a 60% reduction in CD4 count and a 40% decrease
in CD8 are expected, with relative stabilization in a year.
We highlight that the degree of lymphopenia does not seem
to be related to MS relapses. However, more pronounced levels
(i.e., <500 lymphocytes/mm3) have led to a two-fold increase in
the incidence of Herpes-Zoster in the pivotal trial.
