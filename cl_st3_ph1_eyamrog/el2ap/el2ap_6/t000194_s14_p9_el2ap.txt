Frequencies of taxa occurrence were calculated based on Dajoz (1973)
and Zak & Willig (2004), dividing the number of samples
in which the species was registered by the total number
of analyzed samples, multiplied by 100. The fungi were grouped
in the following constancy categories - C: Constant ≥ 50%;
A: Accessory ≥ 25% e < 50%; O: Occasional <
25%.
