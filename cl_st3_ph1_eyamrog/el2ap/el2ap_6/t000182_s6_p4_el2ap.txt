Another aspect worth considering is the form of the proboscis
of triatomines which is very different from the rest of
reduviids (Lent and Wygodzinsky 1979). Reduviids have a hook- shaped
proboscis that when extended points downwards. However, the triatomine proboscis
is straight and possesses a membranous joints, a treat used
by Lent and Wygodzinsky (1979) to distinguish the Triatominae from
other reduviid subfamilies. This morphological feature is associated with the
hematophagous –and kleptophagous– habit that distinguish triatomines. Belminus bugs used
such proboscis flexibility to pierce the cockroach from below in
arena 1. The proboscis behavior performed by Belminus and all
triatomines is not possible within predator reduviids which have a
hook-shaped proboscis solely capable of piercing its prey from above.
Cobben (1979) regards triatomines as an “advanced” subfamily within Reduviidae
according to this mouth-part structure and function. Such morphologic-behavioral coupling
(sensu Varela 1988) illustrates a structural adaptation (sensu Croizat 1962,
Greham 1984, Otálora-Luna et al. 2017), and deserves special consideration
as it might be tracing the course of evolution of
kleptophagy in these insects (Aldana et al. 2019).
