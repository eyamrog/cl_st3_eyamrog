Results: In the UFPB, all on-site teaching was suspended, and
resources for distance learning set up as a supplementary semester
to be available as face to face classes later. A
protocol for clinical care followed safety measures recommended by Brazilian
official health institutions. The adequacy of the physical structure, human
resources, and personal protective equipment (PPE) acquisition for the return
to clinical activities are currently under discussion. In the UP,
learning activities were shifted to virtual teaching using lecture recordings
and live sections. All elective patients care was postponed. Urgent
dental cases were discussed via teledentistry. The physical layout of
the dental clinics and pre-clinical laboratories were changed, allowing a
safe distance between students. In the GU, all clinical and
pre-clinical activities were cancelled, and theoretical activities were maintained online
for all students. Several clinically based scenarios where created and
delivered in the format of online problem-based learning. The reception
area was redesigned, ensuring social distancing. Safety measures follow the
Australia Dental Association.
