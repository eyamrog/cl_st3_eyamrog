The New Coronavirus Epidemic (2019-nCoV), discovered in the city of
Wuhan, China, in December 2019, presents mainly with pulmonary pneumonia
that is preceded by fever, cough and myalgia. However, as
the disease spread globally and the number of hospitalizations increased
exponentially, it was noted that most serious patients hospitalized by
COVID-19 have laboratory changes worthy of attention, such as lymphopenia,
neutrophilia, increased time of prothrombin and increased levels of D-dimer.
Due to these changes proving to be crucial for the
mortality and morbidity rates in this subset of infected people,
several studies focusing on the pathophysiology, mainly hematological, of the
disease appear every day. Deepening these studies, several published works
have shown SarsCoV-2 infection to the installation of a prothrombotic
state in hospitalized patients, which leads to the potential occurrence
of thrombotic or arterial events in this cohort. Thus, in
order to understand how the departments of Angiology and Vascular
Surgery are acting in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic,
this work aims to gather studies that reveal from protocols
applied in vascular services in the current situation, until to
the role of vascular surgeons and angiologists in the clinical
and surgical management of patients infected or not, as a
way of helping and clarifying this specialty during the context
of a pandemic due to the new coranavirus. For the
selection of works, the following search criteria were used: “Coronavirus
and venous thrombosis”, “Coronavirus and thrombosis”, “COVID-19 and venous thrombosis”
and “COVID-19 Coronavirus and thrombosis”.
