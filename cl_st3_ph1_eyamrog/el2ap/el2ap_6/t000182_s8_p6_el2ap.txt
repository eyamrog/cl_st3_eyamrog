When a kissing bug approaches to bite a host, it
performs a highly stereotyped behavioral sequence called fixed action pattern
(FAP) which is relatively invariant within Triatominae, and within Heteroptera.
According to Páez-Rondón et al. (2018) different stimuli, such as
temperature, chemical, visual and olfactory cues alone suffice to initiate
the FAP associated with triatomine feeding. The behavioral sequence described
by these authors starts with orientation to an object; subsequently
the following behaviors are observed: visualization, exploring with the antennae,
touching with the legs, extension of the proboscis and sucking
of liquid. In this work, based on Páez-Rondón et al.
(2018) discovery, we described the FAP employed by B. ferroae
to identify, approach and suck a living cockroach. The “orientation”
approach used by this author and in the current study,
according to Roeder (1998), is somewhere between behaviorism (i.e., learning
psychology) and ethology. Considering Crist (1998) criticism of the semantic
style of the founders of ethology –and considering some stylistic
elements used by the pioneers of the behavioral observation of
animals (Darwin and Wallace 1858, Darwin 1983, Humboldt 1991)– we
searched for the distinctive innate traits that might facilitate the
phylogenetic placement of Belminus species. The primary question from an
ethological perspective was: how do Belminus species approach their prey
compared to the ancestral assassin bugs? Previous studies on triatomine
orientation behavior have mainly focused on odors emanating from the
host’s skin and breath (Otálora-Luna et al. 2004, Guerenstein and
Lazzari 2009, Aldana et al. 2008, Ortiz et al. 2011)
which are by-products of the host-associated microflora and host metabolism
of vertebrates.
