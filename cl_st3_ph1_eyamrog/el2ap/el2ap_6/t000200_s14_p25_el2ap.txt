For each Region, in addition to leptospirosis rates, the magnitude
of the associations among months of occurrence and leptospirosis rate
are presented, represented by the coefficient of correlation (r) and
the proportion of variation in disease occurrence, which can be
explained by the independent variable (R2). In interpreting trends, in
addition to calculating the beta coefficient (b), it was also
chosen to estimate the Monthly Percentage Variation (MPV), which adjusts
the points of temporal series through the logarithmic transformation of
the values of Y, with additional benefits by reducing the
heterogeneity of variance of residues from regression, obtained by the
formula: MPV = [-1+10b1]*100%. The trends of increase, decrease or
stability, and their p-value are presented.
