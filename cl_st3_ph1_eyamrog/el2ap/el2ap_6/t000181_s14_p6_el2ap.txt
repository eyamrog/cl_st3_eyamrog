The authors authorized us to use the FCV-19S and CPDI
scales in the research. We translated and adapted them to
the Brazilian Portuguese language. We used descriptive statistics as data
analysis method: CPDI and FCV-19S average scores, male and female
frequency ranges, and the coefficient correlation of the scales (Pearson's
r).
