OBJECTIVE: Considering the rapid spread of COVID-19, the scientific community
has been looking for ways to recognize factors that may
interfere with the outcome of viral infection. Despite the lack
of studies with the new coronavirus, it is known that
adequate serum levels of micronutrients are essential for the organic
response to infectious diseases. Thus, we aim to review the
effects of vitamin A, D, iron, zinc, or folate deficiency
on the prognosis of patients with respiratory infections with manifestations
similar to COVID-19 and discuss about supplementation of the nutrients
analyzed in this review.
