In general terms, the formation of the Network was the
result of work conducted by civil and women’s organizations, which
showed a strong territorial presence and entered into alliances with
local professionals. Among these organizations is “Catholics for the Right
to Decide”, which had been carrying out education and awareness-raising
actions for more than a decade prior to the Network
establishment.3
