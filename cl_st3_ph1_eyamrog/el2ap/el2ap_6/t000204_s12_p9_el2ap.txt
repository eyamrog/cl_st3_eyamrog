In a pandemic, fear increases the levels of anxiety and
stress in healthy individuals and intensifies the symptoms of those
with pre-existing psychiatric disorders (15). However, little is known about
individuals affected by their reactions based on fear of infectious
disease. In China, the initial focus of the current pandemic,
high levels of depression, post-traumatic stress, anxiety and insomnia have
occurred among health professionals (16, 17) and their patients infected
by COVID-19 (18), but the extent to which these psychological
conditions are attributable to coronavirus anxiety has not been determined.
