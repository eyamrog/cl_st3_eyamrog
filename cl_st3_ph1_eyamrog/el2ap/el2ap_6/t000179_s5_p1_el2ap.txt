The set of instruments was composed by three independents scales
that were analyzed proved solid factorial structure and measurement invariance,
which makes it possible for group comparison. They also achieved
stability in their scores as they showed adequate internal consistency
coefficients. Based on our findings, these instruments are suitable for
measuring job satisfaction in physicians who work in the outpatient
clinic in the Peruvian health system, as our data is
representative at the country level. These instruments could become useful
tools for evaluating different aspects of job satisfaction in physicians
and could guide decision-making in human resources arena and health
services research. These scales can be used together to assess
different aspects of job satisfaction of physicians or independently to
assess specific areas of job satisfaction.
