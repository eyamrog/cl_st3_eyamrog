Research has demonstrated that appropriate air filtration limits the pass-through
of virus particles, which frequently hitch a ride on larger
particles, into downstream areas. Properly installed higher efficiency filters can
remove particles of a relevant size depending on their installed
capture efficiency. The National Air Filtration Association (NAFA) described some
benefit that can be reasonably inferred for appropriately sized (e.g.,
their removal rate is appropriate for the room), maintained, and
operated portable (HEPA) filters [19]. A study conducted by the
National Air Duct Cleaners Association (NADCA) recommended that an HVAC
system should be inspected at a minimum, twice a year
[20].
