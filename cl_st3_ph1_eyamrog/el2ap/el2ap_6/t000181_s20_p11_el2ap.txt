Considering that women frequently take on most of the burden
and risk of Health care providers' roles at home, often
with little external support (Smith, 2019), the fourteenth question of
the scale that measures the exhaustion factor (I feel tired
or even exhausted) showed big differences between genders: men had
lower scores as they never (20.7%) or occasionally (26.4%) felt
tired or even exhausted during the pandemic, while women felt
that way often (22.5%) and most of the time (27.9%).
Moreover, schoolsâ€™ closure has a differential effect on women, who
provide most of the informal care within families (Smith, 2019).
