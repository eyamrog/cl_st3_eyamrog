When health systems include Network professionals, there exist stronger possibilities
that professionals be influenced by their own peers, by the
latterâ€™s actions, opinions and public declaration as abortion service providers.
This means they generate a symbolic effect inside the institutions
and health teams where they work and, at a community
level, too, as a consequence of this visibility. At the
same time, changes in public opinion are also sought after
over the legitimacy of the demand for the Legal Interruption
of Pregnancy.
