Three different arenas were used to study the behavior of
Belminus species. Bioassays were conducted at 24 Â°C and 68%
RH, and were illuminated by fluorescent ceiling lights (brightness 2000
lux, color temperature 4000 K), unless otherwise specified. All experiments
were performed in Merida, Venezuela, between 1700 and 1860 meters
above the sea level.
