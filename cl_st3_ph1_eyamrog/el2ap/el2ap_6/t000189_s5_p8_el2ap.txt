Although the results related to vitamin D are heterogeneous, it
is known that vitamin D deficiency has been a common
nutritional disorder in patients diagnosed with respiratory tract infections [34,35].
Inamo et al (2011) [36], in their hospital-based retrospective case
study, observed that Japanese children (mean age 14.03Â±11.43 months) with
bronchiolitis or pneumonia who had vitamin D deficiency (<10ng/mL) were
the ones who most needed oxygen and/or ventilation support (p<0.01).
