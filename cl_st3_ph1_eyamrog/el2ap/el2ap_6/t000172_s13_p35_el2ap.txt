Chloroquine (CQ) has been tested as well against SARS-CoV. It
promotes alkalinization of acid vesicles in cells infected by intracellular
pathogens (Rolain et al. 2007) and emerged as a substitute
to quinine against malaria. CQ and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been
tested against viral hepatitis (PAREJA‚ÄêCORONEL 1963), dengue virus (Farias et
al. 2015), HIV (Paton et al. 2002), other viruses, and
also against other pathogens, such as intracellular bacteria (Coxiela burnetii
and Tropheryma whipplei), bacteria-like Legionella pneumophila and Mycobacterium spp, and
fungal infections by Histoplasma capsulate and Cryptococcus neoformans (Rolain et
al. 2007). CQ is active in Vero E6 and Huh7
cells infected with MERS-CoV (De Wilde et al. 2014), but
not in dendritic cells and monocyte-derived macrophages (Cong et al.
2018). CQ is also active in vitro against SARS-CoV either
before or after virus exposure, interfering with ACE2 glycosylation and
inhibiting viral binding (Keyaerts et al. 2004; Vincent et al.
2005). In addition, CQ induces alteration of endosomal pH that
inhibits viral infection (Simmons et al. 2004).
