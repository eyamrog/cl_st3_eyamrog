In previous research on the hurricane and flood, as well
as other infectious disease epidemics, adverse psychological reactions covering anxiety,
acute stress, addictive behaviours and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder,

population during and after these threatening events (20). Thus, it
is believed that they will certainly occur in the current
COVID-19 pandemic.
