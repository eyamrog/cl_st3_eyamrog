The Food and Drug Administration of the United States of
America (FDA) defines a N95 respirator mask as a respiratory
protective device designed to achieve a very close facial fit
and very efficient filtration of airborne particles. In addition to
blocking splashes, sprays and large droplets, the respirator is also
designed to prevent the wearer from breathing in very small
particles that may be in the air. While the ultimate
effectiveness of these respirator masks is debated, respirator masks are
believed to be the best currently available method of protecting
against inhalation of highly infectious airborne particles.
