But, which volatiles are emitted by cockroach feces? Besides specific
pheromones (Schal 1992), nitrogenous compounds such as ammonia, methylamine, dimethylamine
and trimethylamine (Sakuma and Fukami 1990) as well as carboxylic
acids such as acetic, propionic, isobutyric, butyric, isovaleric and valeric
acid (McFarlane and Alli 1985) are major components of the
excreta of cockroaches, many of which elicit searching behaviors in
other triatomine species (Guerenstein and Lazzari 2009, Ortiz et al.
2011, Otálora-Luna and Guerin 2014). Ammonia attracts triatomines and emanates
in large amounts from both vertebrate feces (Otálora-Luna and Guerin
2014) as well as from cockroaches’ feces (Mullins and Cochrand
1972). Belminus avoidance responses to mice wastes and attraction responses
to cockroach feces suggest that Belminus species might recognize unknown
specific as well as known general volatiles (e.g. ammonia, CO2,
carboxylic acids, aromatics, etc.) emitted by excretory products of their
host. Odors from vertebrate and invertebrate hosts, while sharing several
molecules, produce ambivalent effects depending on the dose, combination with
other molecules, combination with other modalities (e.g. visual cues), physiological
state of the insect, among other factors. For example, we
know that isobutyric acid and ammonia have different behavioral effects
on triatomines depending on the dose. They evoke repellency and
scape responses when released “ suddenly” at high doses but
are attractive at low doses (Schofield 1975, Guerenstein and Guerin
2001, Otálora-Luna and Guerin 2014). Such parsimony or use of
the same chemical as a releaser of different behaviors is
common in arthropods (Blum 1996). This might explain how the
cockroach in arena 1 elicited the FAP while the cockroach
in the box (arena 2) or in the bottle (arena
3) did not elicited the FAP. Probably, the visual and/or
physical (tactile) presence of the cockroach was required as volatiles
were not sufficient.
