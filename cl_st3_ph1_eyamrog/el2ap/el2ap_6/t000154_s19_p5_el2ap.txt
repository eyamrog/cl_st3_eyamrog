The other core trait, open reports, was the one with
support more closely matching agreement with open peer review in
general, both in terms of stakeholders believing it would improve
peer review (Table 3) and in terms of them agreeing
it would provide useful information to readers and improve the
quality of the reviewer reports (Table 4). On the other
hand, a similar proportion of participants worried open reports would
inhibit reviewers from making strong criticism, or from agreeing to
review.
