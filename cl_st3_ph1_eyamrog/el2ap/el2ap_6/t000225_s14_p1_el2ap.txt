In order to assess the effects of SDS in São
Paulo City and State on the evolution of deaths due
to COVID-19 on a daily basis, we used the public
data from the National Association of the Registrars for Natural
Persons (Associação dos Registradores de Pessoas Naturais — ARPEN), an
organization that congregates all Public Notaries in Brazil. Their website
pres­ ents the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 referenced
to the date in which they happened9. In Brazil, a
public notary is an organization legally responsible for issuing and
keeping registry of births, deaths, marriages, and other legal events.
A death certificate is an official document containing a field
in which a certified physician informs the cause of death.
ARPEN’s website also contains data informing the number of COVID-19-suspected
deaths, attributed by a certified physician. The term “Confirmed COVID-19
deaths” is used for cases in which there was a
PCR test with positive result for COVID-19. The term “Suspected
COVID-19 deaths” is used for cases in which COVID-19 was
described as a cause of death with clinical diagnosis.
