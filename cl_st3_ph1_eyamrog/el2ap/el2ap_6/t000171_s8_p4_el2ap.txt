Minas Gerais (MG) has a pivotal role at the national
level as it is the second largest Brazilian state in
population size, estimated at 21 million people, located in a
strategic region, close to states with high incidence rates, such
as SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, hence making it
highly conducive to the transmittal of COVID-19 (2).
