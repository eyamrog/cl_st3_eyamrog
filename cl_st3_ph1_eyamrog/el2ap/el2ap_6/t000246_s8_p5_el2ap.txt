Bibliometric research, which includes the application of statistics to bibliography,
has three classically recognized laws: Bradford's Law, Lotka's Law and
Zipf's Law 6-7. The bibliometric studies are based on a
set of laws and empirical principles from information science, whose
objective is to investigate the quantitative aspects of the production,
dissemination and use of available and recorded information, thus contributing
to the evaluation of the current state of science, as
well as the management of research 6-8.
