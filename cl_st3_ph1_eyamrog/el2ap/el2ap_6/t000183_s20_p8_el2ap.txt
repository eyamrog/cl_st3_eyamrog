Table N.2 shows that both groups seem to lack proper
reading skills such as using their own words to interpret
content, adding new ideas or predicting and giving opinions or
establishing connections in the information presented. This was observed through
the analysis of the results existing in some of the
questions specifically formulated to measure those skills (control group 3,92
points and 4,22 points the experimental one). It can also
be seen that there is a noticeable improvement in the
experimental group that obtained 7,02 out of 10 in the
post-test, which means the proposal to use graphic organizers to
enhance reading was effective, agreeing that graphic organizers are useful
when trying to understand information (Graves & Graves 2003).
