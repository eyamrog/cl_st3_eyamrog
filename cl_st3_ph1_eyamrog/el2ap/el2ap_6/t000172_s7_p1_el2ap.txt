In 2002 and 2003, the first coronavirus outbreak started in
Guangdong province in China, causing a total of 8,098 cases
and 774 deaths worldwide, with a mortality rate of around
9% (Fehr and Perlman 2015). This outbreak was responsible for
causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS. In 2012, another
outbreak started in the middle- east, called MERS (Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome), with an initial mortality rate of close to
50%, getting controlled in the following years. In 2014, a
total of 855 cases and 333 deaths were reported by
the MERS-CoV, with a 40% mortality rate, according to the
European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (Fehr and Perlman
2015). Before these two outbreaks, coronaviruses were believed to cause
only self-limiting mild respiratory tract infections in humans.
