Nations have taken different measures to slow down the spread
of the virus that causes COVID-19. Lockdown, shelter in place,
stay at home orders, travel ban, and social distancing, for
instance, were measures that dramatically impacted the globe both socially
and economically. The physical distancing of one metre or more,
wearing face masks for both health-care workers and the general
public as well as eye protection are mechanisms already supported
by findings from a recent systematic review and meta-analysis [6].
