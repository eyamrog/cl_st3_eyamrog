Short-term harm to studentsâ€™ health as a result of missed
meals during the pandemic may include fatigue and a reduced
immune response, which makes children and adolescents more vulnerable to
contracting infectious agents such as viruses, bacteria, etc., and consequently
to developing diseases, which can worsen their condition because of
a deficient immune response. In the long term, this harm
can affect psychological, physical, and emotional development [19].
