Based on the Zootaxa suppression and the academic engagement into
a bandwagon sympathetic commotion, opinions in social media, and letters
from societies and researchers (e.g., SBH 2020, SOL 2020, Van
Damme 2020), mainly from megadiverse countries, which appear to be
in favor of the journal and ask Clarivate to review
its decision, two main conclusions could be unearthed: (1) JIF
is very important to taxonomy and (2) taxonomy is under
attack. We seriously doubt both conclusions and invite the reader
to carefully consider these aspects.
