The 30-items job satisfaction questionnaire of ENSUSALUD evaluates different job-
related aspects and is divided into three different scales: general
professional activity (6 items), Health Services Management (8 items), and
working conditions of the health center (16 items). Each of
these items is Likert type and has five answer options
(5 = very satisfied; 4 = satisfied; 3 = neither
satisfied nor dissatisfied; 2 = dissatisfied; 1 = very dissatisfied).
The scale appears in supplement 1. A preliminary English version
of the items is also presented for comparison purposes, which
were not evaluated in this study (see Supplement 2).
