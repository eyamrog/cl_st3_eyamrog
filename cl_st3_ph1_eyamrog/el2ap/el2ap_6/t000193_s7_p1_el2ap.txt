The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the latest threat
to global health. It is a fast-spreading respiratory infection caused
by a novel coronavirus identified in December 2019. As it
can evolve to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and has
a high transmission rate (on average, each infected person spreads
the virus to another two people), it poses a challenge
to public health and clinical practice. The pandemic is not
expected to end for at least 18 months1. During this
time, management of chronic autoimmune diseases will be a challenge.
