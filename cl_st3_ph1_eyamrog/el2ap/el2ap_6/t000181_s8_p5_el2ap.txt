Consequently, and as a result of a collaboration involving a
group of Brazilian and foreign researchers interested in the effects
of the impact and the varied psychological states caused by
the rapid spread of Covid-19 around the world, was created
the research project “Physical, Psychological, and Cognitive reactions to Covid-
19”, approved by the Research Ethics Committee (CEP) of Federal
University of Alfenas (UNIFAL-MG) (process number: 4.128.627). The project is
divided into six modules, each one aiming to assess, or
measure, some particular dimension of a psychological state derived from
the Covid-19 pandemics: psychological reactions to pandemics; psychological vulnerability factors;
social isolation, the role of the media and the dissemination
of coronavirus-19; effective ways to deal with psychological problems; and,
the implications for public health policies, including appropriate interventions for
risk communication.
