The outcome variable is represented by the number of monthly
cases of leptospirosis. The monthly rates of incidence as a
whole were calculated in the period for each group of
months. Adjustment for potential variations in the age structure and
gender, upon comparing different periods, used the method of direct
rates standardization, taking the population of Santa Catarina in 2010
as a reference. The number of cases of leptospirosis, its
monthly average and the rate of the disease in the
period studied are displayed. It was chosen to present the
non-standardized rates, whenever a significant correlation (r > 0.90) was
found when comparing the raw and standardized rates, thus retaining
the original value of the rates, understood as more representative
and interpretable.
