A better ethological –behavioral, systematic, evolutionary, etc.– understanding of the
Triatominae is essential for the development of novel control programs.
In particular, the study of instinctive behaviors of Belminus and
other triatomine species is critical in the design of experiments
aimed at improving control technologies.
