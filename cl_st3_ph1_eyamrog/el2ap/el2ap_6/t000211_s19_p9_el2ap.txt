For Casini et al.9, all patients hospitalized with COVID-19 should
receive pharmacoprophylaxis, unless contraindicated. Thus, they recommend the use of
LMWH in patients with creatinine clearance > 30 mL/min and
NFH in patients with clearance < 30mL/min, increasing the dose
in both cases in patients over 100kg. They also guide
the regular monitoring (daily or two to three times a
week) of all patients with prothrombin time, DD, fibrinogen, platelet
count, LDH, creatinine and ALT, in addition to antithrombin if
the patient has DIC, coagulopathy induced by sepsis or heparin
resistance, and anti-Xa activity in selected cases. One should consider
the use of therapeutic doses of NFH or LMWH in
ICU patients with increased DD, signs of severe inflammation, or
signs of hepatic or renal dysfunction.
