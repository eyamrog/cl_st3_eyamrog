Background: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a
potential threat to patients with autoimmune disorders, including multiple sclerosis
(MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Such patients are
usually treated with immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive agents, which may tamper
with the organismâ€™s normal response to infections. Currently, no consensus
has been reached on how to manage MS and NMOSD
patients during the pandemic.
