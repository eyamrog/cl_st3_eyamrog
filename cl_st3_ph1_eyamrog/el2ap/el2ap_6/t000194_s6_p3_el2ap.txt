The conductivity, in general, can be characterized as low, ranging
from a maximum of 0.057 to 0.043 S.cm-1. The values
of dissolved oxygen were expected to be high in view
of the fact that most sites are running waters, with
the exception of Poço das Antas, which is a pond.
The values varied from 6.73 to 10.45 mgO2/L (table 1).
The values of conductivity and dissolved oxygen were larger in
relation to previous studies in the Atlantic rainforest. Nascimento (2007)
obtained values between 0.02 to 0.03 µS.cm-1 of conductivity and
5.1 to 7.8 mgO2/L for dissolved oxygen in the Parque
Estadual da Cantareira.
