Some uncertainty arises from the fact that, being a new
disease for which biochemical tests are not widely available, it
is possible that the cause of death may be attributed
to other factors but COVID-19 in some cases. Following the
guidelines by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, we chose to
include the deaths attributed directly to COVID (suspected and conÂ­
firmed) plus the excess deaths attributed by the ARPEN data
to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2020 with respect
to 2019 (deaths in 2020 minus the deaths in 2019,
which we consider a baseline) in the count discussed in
this article.
