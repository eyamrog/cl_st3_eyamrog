The next processes of coronavirus replication and transcription are outlined
in figure 2 below. Once produced and processed, part of
the non-structural proteins together with nsp12, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRp), assemble the Replication and Transcription Complex (RTC). RTC acts
primarily by producing a set of single-stranded negative RNAs (ssRNA-),
including copies of the genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs, which
will then serve as templates for the production of the
genome and mRNA, respectively. These intermediate negative RNA molecules are
about 1% as abundant as their respective positive counterparts and
contain anti-leader sequences, present in the 5’ untranslated region (UTR)
of the antigenome and in the 3’-UTR of the genome
(Sethna et al. 1991). On the other hand, in the
5’-UTR of the viral genome and 3'-UTR of the antigenome
there are leader sequences. The leader and anti-leader sequences are
used by the RTC to initiate replication and transcription. In
the 5’-UTR of the genome and at the beginning of
each ORF of the structural genes there are other regulatory
regions, called Transcriptional Regulatory Sequences (TRS), as shown in figures
1 and 2. During the transcription of ssRNA molecules, two
mechanisms may happen, according to the currently established model of
replication of coronaviruses (Pasternak et al. 2006; Sawicki et al.
2007):
