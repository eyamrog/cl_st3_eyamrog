This research is aimed to obtain indicators and evaluation of
the main consumption, habits, and cultural practices of university students
of the UNAE, this constitutes the main objectives of the
research. Its theoretical foundation rests on the initial framework proposed
by Canclini (2006) and Bigott (2007), although bearing in mind
the socio-historical changes generated from the new forms and ways
of consumption derived from the incorporation and development of new
technologies. From this perspective, previous conceptualizations are necessary. In the
first place, this process of appropriation and use of technological
and cultural devices are not conceived from an economic perspective,
but from the construction of meanings that can decipher social
behaviors. On the other hand, a habit is understood as
the frequent cultural behavior of some cultural activities, which should
not necessarily be associated with the practice of such activities
while the concept practice is used for specific sectors such
as recorded music, video, television, radio, computer, and the Internet.
