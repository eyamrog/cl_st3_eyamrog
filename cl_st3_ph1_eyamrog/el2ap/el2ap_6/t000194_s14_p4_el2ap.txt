During the field trips on the shores and about 30
cm deep at each site, 10 leaves were selected from
the submerged mixed leaf litter using tweezers. The leaves and
water taken from the site were placed in previously sterile
200 mL polyethylene bottles. During the entire study, 72 samples
were collected and transported to the laboratory.
