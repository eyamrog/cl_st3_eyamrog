The one-dimensional model and the two-dimensional model had adequate goodness-of-
fit indices. However, the two-dimensional model has an extremely high
latent correlation (greater than 0.80) suggesting that its dimensions might
have been overlapping (see Table 3). Hence, the best model
for this scale was the one-dimensional one with eight items.
