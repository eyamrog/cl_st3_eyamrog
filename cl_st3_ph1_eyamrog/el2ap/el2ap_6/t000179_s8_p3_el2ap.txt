Peru is a middle-income country in Latin America that has
suffered historical and structural difficulties and deficiencies in the public
health arena including financial crises and an unfavorable political climate.
Due to these limitations, job satisfaction of the healthcare personnel
has received scarce attention (14). In addition, Peru has an
underdeveloped healthcare system that lacks of sufficient human resources and
financial support, which contributes directly to the reproduction of inequities
in healthcare (15, 16). There are several situations that could
be influencing health workers and physicians’ job satisfaction in Peru;
nevertheless, to our knowledge no valid and reliable instrument has
been developed to adequately assess them at national level. The
lack of a robust measure of physicians´ job satisfaction could
obscure the diagnosis and monitoring in this topic in this
country, and also have an impact on health policy planning
and human resources sustainability. In 2016, the National Health Authority
(SUSALUD, from the Spanish acronym) carried out the National Survey
of Satisfaction of Users in Health (ENSUSALUD, from Spanish acronym)
to evaluate the User Satisfaction of Universal Health Insurance on
six different populations in Peruvian Health System. One section was
performed in doctors working in healthcare centers. ENSUSALUD included questions
related to job satisfaction of these professionals; nonetheless, no formal
analysis was carried out to evaluate the validity and reliability
of these instruments.
