Supporting this tendency Qi et al. [31] in a survey
with 684 Chinese children (age range 5 months to 12
years old), observed that vitamin A deficiency (retinol<0.2mg/L) was a
risk factor for the development of acute respiratory tract infection
(p<0.05). It is worth noting the possibility of non-causal effects
in these findings, as it is known that vitamin A
concentrations may decrease in the presence of infectious conditions due
to the acute phase response [32].
