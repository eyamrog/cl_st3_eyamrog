In support of the Ministry of Health of Brazil, the
Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has developed a series of
tools to assist governments in decision- making regarding the tightening
or loosening of measures, such as the technical guide “Considerations
on adjustments to social distance measures and travel-related measures in
the context of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic”. Another
important tool is the “Epidemic Calculator”, which produces scenarios (and
not predictions about the future) from values, data, and parameters
(number of available beds, transmission speed, and social contact). The
effectiveness of the model is directly related to the quality
of the information used in the calculation.4
