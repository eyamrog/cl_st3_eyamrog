Despite advances in publications around the relationship between COVID-19 and
the prothrombotic condition that patients have been presenting, so far
there are no complete studies associating VTE with COVID-19 infection.
However, Cui et al.23 retrospectively analyzed 81 critically ill patients
with COVID-19 pneumonia in the ICU and found an incidence
of 25% of VTE. Klok et al.24, found an incidence
of 31% of thrombotic complications in ICU patients with COVID-19
infections despite thrombosis prophylaxis, this percentage being remarkably high. Middeldorp
et al.25 stated that the risk of VTE in patients
with COVID-19 is high, especially in patients hospitalized in the
ICU, and that adopting a screening strategy with diagnostic tests
at a low threshold may be a good approach. It
is thus clear that a joint effort between local professionals
working in the field of Angiology and Vascular Surgery is
necessary so that a collaborative network can increasingly improve, at
the collective level, the carried out procedures and care flowcharts,
in addition to assisting in the remodeling of services provided
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
