Currently, no consensus has been reached on how to manage
MS and NMOSD patients during the pandemic. The Brazilian Committee
for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (BCTRIMS), the Latin
American Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (LACTRIMS),
and the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple
Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) have issued expert recommendations on their websites10,11. In
the next few topics, we will discuss management strategies for
patients with demyelinating disorders that have been adopted at two
large MS/NMOSD care centers in the city of SÃ£o Paulo,
Brazil, during this period. We offer a practical approach aimed
at mitigating COVID-19 infection risk whilst maintaining clinical stability and
safety.
