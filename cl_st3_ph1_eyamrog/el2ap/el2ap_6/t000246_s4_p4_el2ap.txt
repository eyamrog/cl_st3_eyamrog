As the classical formulation of the Law was used, it
was predictable that the adjustment would not be perfect, since
n variables influence the empirical distribution of the literature. These
variables are not captured by Bradford's classical formula, and represent
the greatest challenge to contemporary scholars of its mathematical formulation.
The core pointed out from the application of the Law
perfectly recognized an important aspect related to the scientific academic
behavior on SARS, that is, when there is evidence that
certain journals are or will be recognized in the environment,
more and more publications are directed to it, for this,
it would be important to verify the qualitative aspect of
these journals, based on the impact factor indicators, these would
be the most reliable.
