In this communication, we use a time-series analysis of deaths
attributed to ­COVID-19, in which each death is referenced to
the date of death, and not to the date in
which a ­COVID-19 test had its results concluded. The series
is obtained from the Civil Registry in Brazil, and its
analysis demonstrates that SDS had a significant impact on reducing
the number of deaths in São Paulo State. We also
estimate the reduction in the number of deaths obtained with
the SDS and the intensity of social distancing needed to
halt the spread of disease.
