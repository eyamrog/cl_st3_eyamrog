In Latin America, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations (FAO) encourages countries to develop their school feeding
programs. In the United States, there are at least two
care programs aimed at vulnerable children, such as the School
Nutrition Program, a school nutrition program aimed at offering free
meals to children from needy families, and the Farmers Market
Nutrition Program (FMNP), a special supplementary nutrition program for women,
babies, and children. Another program of great relevance is the
World Food Program (WFP), a worldwide initiative that serves about
17.3 million school children with meals and snacks [WFP].
