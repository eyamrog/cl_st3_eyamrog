Natalizumab is associated with increased infection risk when compared to
beta-interferons and glatiramer acetate. However, it has a lower infection
risk than other high-efficacy therapies, such as fingolimod and anti-CD20
monoclonal antibodies41. Natalizumab has well-established safety and efficacy profile, except
for the 0.7% of PML cases in real-life series42. This
rare and fatal infectious demyelinating disease is caused by a
polyomavirus called John Cunningham virus (JCV). PML associated with natalizumab
use is a constant concern. Extended-interval dosing43,44 is a strategy
that has proven, through observational data, to reduce PML risk,
while maintaining treatment efficacy. It consists of a 5â€“ 8
weeks interval dosing of natalizumab instead of the standard 4
weeks (standard interval dosing). This strategy is particularly interesting in
the COVID-19 pandemic setting, as it allows less exposure to
viral contamination. Our current protocol involves a 6-week interval dosing
for patients previously treated with the standard interval protocol and,
in some cases, an 8-week interval dosing for patients previously
treated with a 6-week interval.
