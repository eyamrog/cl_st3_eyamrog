It should also be noted that 75% of the students
surveyed have scholarship grants awarded by the University itself and
the Institute for the Promotion of Human Talent. Finally, 62%
of the students analyzed are in a state of family
dependence and 80% are in the most precarious quintiles (see
Figure 1).
