The genus Belminus (Bolboderini) is among the least well-known groups
of triatomines, and is composed of the species: Belminus corredori
Galv찾o & Angulo, 2006; Belminus costaricensis Herrer, Lent & Wygodzinsky,
1954; Belminus ferroae Sandoval, Pab처n, Jurberg & Galv찾o, 2007; Belminus
herreri Lent & Wygodzinsky, 1979; Belminus laportei Lent, Jurberg &
Carcavallo, 1995; Belminus peruvianus Herrer, Lent & Wygodzinsky; 1954, Belminus
pittieri Osuna &Ayala, 1993; and Belminus rugulosus St책l, 1859. The
geographical distribution of these relatively small (compared to other species
of) triatomines is discontinuous and known only from a scarce
number of specimens captured in Central America, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela,
and northern Brazil. B. peruvianus, B. herreri and B. ferroae
have been reported vectoring T. cruzi inside human dwellings of
Peru and Colombia (Sandoval et al. 2010). Very little is
known about the genus Belminus, among other reasons, because it
is difficult to maintain these species in captivity. The feeding
behavior of Belminus bugs is currently being unveiled, and the
most controversial revelation is that these peculiar species live off
invertebrate hemolymph to complete their life cycle. They are facultative
bloodsuckers but can survive by exclusively feeding on fluids of
other arthropods. Sandoval et al. (2004, 2010) studies on B.
herreri and B. ferroae concluded that cockroaches (Blattodea: Blaberidae) are
the principal hosts in human abodes, although adults occasionally feed
on humans. These authors captured B. herreri and B. ferroae
in houses where cockroaches were present; >86% of the intestinal
contents tested reacted with Periplaneta americana antiserum, while only a
small proportion reacted to human blood antisera. Sandoval et al.
(2013) demonstrated that B. ferroae showed a higher fitness when
feeding on Blaberus cockroaches compared with mice, i.e. a higher
adaptation to the invertebrate host.
