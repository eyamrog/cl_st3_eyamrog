Since the quasi-experimental approach was selected, there was two different
measurements, one with a pre-test (before intervention) and one with
a post-test (after the intervention). The selected level of significance
for this social science research was Î± = 0.05 and
a risk of 5% is assumed, making the confidence level
equals to 95%.
