Species of this family, except the genus Haddowia, are widely
distributed in the tropics with records in several brazilian ecosystems
(Gibertoni & Cavalcanti 2003, Ryvarden 2004, Silveira et al. 2008,
Baltazar & Gibertoni 2009, Campacci & Gugliotta 2009, Drechsler-Santos et
al. 2009, Gomes-Silva & Gibertoni 2009, Gibertoni & Drechsler-Santos 2010,
Gugliotta et al. 2010, Gomes-Silva et al. 2011, Costa-Rezende et
al. 2016, Bononi et al. 2017). However, knowledge about this
family in the Cerrado biome is restricted to records of
17 species, with a predominance of the genera Amauroderma and
Ganoderma (Gibertoni & Drechsler-Santos 2010, Abrah√£o et al. 2012, Maia
et al. 2015, Costa-Rezende et al. 2016, Bononi et al.
2017). The present study presents new species occurrences of the
family Ganodermataceae for the brazilian Cerrado and Midwest region.
