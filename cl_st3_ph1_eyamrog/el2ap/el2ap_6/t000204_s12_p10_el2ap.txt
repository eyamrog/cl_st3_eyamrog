Corroborating these concerns, in a recent study using 775 adults
citizens living in the United States of America, individuals functionally
impaired by the fear and anxiety of the coronavirus exhibited

abuse than those who were anxious, but they did not
have dysfunctional anxiety because of COVID-19 (19).
