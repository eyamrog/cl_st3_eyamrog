Taxonomic groups that still need massive descriptive studies, with many
species waiting to be discovered, such as Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera,
Diptera, and Arachnida, have many journals devoted specifically to them.
The JIF of these journals is similar to that of
Zootaxa and, of course, research on those taxa can also
be published in more general outlets in Entomology or Zoology
categories. Therefore, the high levels of self-citation in Zootaxa are
hardly justifiable. It appears to us that these high levels
are caused by a sociological bias, being a side effect
of the Zootaxa phenomenon. Myths about Zootaxa as the unique
journal that publishes taxonomic studies are clearly harmful to the
field. In addition, an urgent question must be answered: if
Zootaxa decides to ignore JIF altogether, would it remain a
good vehicle for the publication of taxonomic papers? If your
answer is no, there is certainly a big problem with
the community of practitioners in the taxonomic world.
