For confirmatory factor analysis, the models previously obtained in the
exploratory factor analysis were evaluated. All the analysis were performed
considering the complex characteristics of the sampling strategy (complex multistage
sampling), for which the lavaan.survey command was used. The estimator
used was WLSMV (23), and polychoric matrices were used (22).
