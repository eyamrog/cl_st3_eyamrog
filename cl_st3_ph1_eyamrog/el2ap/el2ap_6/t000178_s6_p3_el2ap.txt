We are aware of the limitations of our searches. We
limited the search to the four databases mentioned above for
consistency and reproducibility. We also limited the search to nucleotide
sequences. Further information of protein sequences and structures can be
found in the databases NCBI Protein and Protein Data Bank
(Berman et al. 2000). Also, as we consider only Peruvian
institutions, we did not mention international institutions based in Peru,
for example, the Centro Internacional de la Papa (CIP) or
the US Naval Medical Research Unit Six (NAMRU-6) that also
produced sequences from Peruvian organisms. However, as both institutions are
based in Lima, their inclusion did not change the main
conclusions of our analysis (see Suppl. Inf. 2, 3, 4,
5). Furthermore, we relied on the information provided by the
researchers which could result in heterogeneous data even if it
comes from the same institution, for instance, in BioProject, we
found records from INS, with different names such as “Peruvian
National Institute of Health”, “Instituto Nacional de Salud - Peru”
, “Instituto Nacional de Salud” (Suppl. Inf. 3). Thus, we
believe that each institution must develop an homogenous protocol for
data submission.
