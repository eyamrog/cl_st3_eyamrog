Open interaction was the trait receiving more support, with most
participants believing it would improving peer review (Table 3) and
agreeing it would result in better publications (Table 4). While
almost as many participants believed open final-version commenting would also
improve peer review (Table 3), few agreed with post-publication peer
review in blog articles, online journal clubs, and social media
(Table 4). Support for open participation, open pre-review manuscripts, and
open platforms was also somewhat lesser than for open peer
review in general, but not as small as support for
open identities (Table 3, Table 4).
