The host response to viral infection is another important factor
in COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 induces secretion of IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-10,
IP-10, and MCP-1 (Huang et al. 2020). Patients in intensive
care units show higher levels of IL-2, IL-7, GCSF, IP-
10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and TNF-α that may induce cytokine storm
and exacerbated inflammatory response (Huang et al. 2020). SARS-CoV infects
not only alveolar epithelial cells, but also vascular endothelial cells,
macrophages, monocytes, and lymphocytes. Rapid viral replication causes endothelial cell
damage and vascular leakage, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory
cytokines. Seroconversion of the host leads to the presence of
IgG anti-S protein, which may promote the accumulation of proinflammatory
monocyte/macrophage and release of MCP-1 and IL-8 and have been
linked to severe lung injury (Fu et al. 2020). Viral
clearance depends on the activation of both innate and adaptive
immune responses. IFN-γ and IL-6 contribute to neutrophil recruitment and
transition to the adaptive response. However, exacerbated levels of IL-6
and reduced expression of IFN-γ may decrease CD4+, CD8+, and
NK cells and may be connected to cytokine storm (Lagunas‐Rangel
and Chávez‐Valencia 2020).
