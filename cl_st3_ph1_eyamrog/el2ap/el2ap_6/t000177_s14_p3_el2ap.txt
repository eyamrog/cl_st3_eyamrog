Small particles (< 5 microns): These may stay airborne for
hours and can be transported long distances. They are generated
through coughing, sneezing or talking. Small particles (droplet nuclei or
residue) form from droplets that evaporate and desiccate. The coronavirus
particle is 0.80-0.16 micrometer and remains active in common indoor
air conditions for up to three hours and two to
three days on room surfaces. These small particles can stay
airborne and travel long distances by airflows in the room
or via air ducts of ventilation systems.
