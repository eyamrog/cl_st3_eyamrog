The literature regarding telemedicine and MS has been recently reviewed,
highlighting benefits in several aspects involved in MS care (e.g.,
cost- effectiveness and satisfaction of patients and providers)12. This tool
is supported by the Brazilian Academy of Neurology, which has
recently published recommendations for conducting a remote neurological examination13. Simple
approaches, such as the timed 25-foot walk, are considered feasible
ways of assessing MS patients. If necessary, more complex evaluations,
such as the fundoscopic examination, can also be used with
proper technological support14. However, this method is not without its
drawbacks, particularly concerning compliance to treatment during extended periods and
technological barriers.
