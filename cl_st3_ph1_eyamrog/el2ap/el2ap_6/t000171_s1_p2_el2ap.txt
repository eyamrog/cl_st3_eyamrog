Methods: This is a quantitative analysis of secondary data based
on a cross-sectional research design. Incidence, mortality, date of the
first notification of COVID-19 and number of rapid and RT-PCR
tests were obtained from the sources: Laboratory Environment Manager, e-SUS
epidemiological surveillance platform and SES-MG. Pearson coefficient for correlation was
calculated to establish the level of association between the relevant
data. Descriptive statistical procedures were used to provide a comprehensive
understanding of the distribution of incidence, mortality and test rates
in the territory.
