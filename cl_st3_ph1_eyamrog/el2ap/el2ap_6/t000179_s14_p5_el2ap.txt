During the first half of 2014, a multidisciplinary technical team
(from Health Services Quality Directorate of the Ministry of Health,
Research and Development Intendance of SUSALUD, and Peruvian National Institute
of Statistics) proposed 53 preliminary scales to assess different aspects
of the work of health professionals (physicians and nurses) with
additional sociodemographic data (18). These preliminary scales were based on
a review of the literature and operational tools previously used
by Ministry of Health the country. Each preliminary scale had
from 1 to 22 items and they were all included
in the first version of ENSUSALUD 2014 (one national survey).
The preliminary scales were groups of items based on instruments
already designed or designed ad hoc to evaluate the Peruvian
health system (in this case, the measurement properties had not
been evaluated). Subsequently, in ENSUSALUD 2015 the same technical team
reused the 53 preliminary scales used in the first version
of ENSUSALUD 2014, added some preliminary scales, and modified the
wording of some items based on previous experience (19).
