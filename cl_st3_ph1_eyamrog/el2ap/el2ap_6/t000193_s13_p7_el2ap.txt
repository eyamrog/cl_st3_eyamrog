We believe more caution is required when dealing with NMOSD
relapses. These relapses are often more severe, steroid-refractory, and lead
to greater disability than usually observed in MS20. We suggest
that NMOSD patients with symptoms suggestive of relapses should be
clinically assessed promptly, and usual treatment with intravenous steroids and
plasmapheresis should be considered. If plasma exchange is not available,
intravenous immunoglobulin may contribute to relapse treatment following incomplete response
to steroid treatment21. We underline that not all relapses behave
the same way. ON and longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM)
relapses are usually more aggressive, and early plasma exchange is
associated with better prognosis20. Area postrema syndrome (APS) relapses, for
instance, are usually much more benign than other typical syndromes.
Nonetheless, APS attacks may precede inflammatory involvement of optic nerves
or spinal cord, making APS an important warning sign. About
80% of APS patients improve with steroids (methylprednisolone) in the
first 2 days of treatment, while less than 20% of
them need plasmapheresis. We advise early treatment of APS attacks,
as it may not only reduce clinical severity but also
prevent accompanying disabling ON or transverse myelitis (TM) attacks8,22.
