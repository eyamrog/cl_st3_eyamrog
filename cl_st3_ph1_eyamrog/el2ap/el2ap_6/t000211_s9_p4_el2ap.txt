Thus, hospitalized and critically ill patients have hematological changes that
can be proven, for example, by high DD rates. However,
the relationship between the Sars-Cov-2 virus and coagulation mechanisms is
still poorly explored in recent studies. Han et al.5 demonstrated
that antithrombin, a natural anticoagulant, values in patients with COVID-19
were lower, while DD and other fibrin degradation product (FDP)
were higher when compared with the control, healthy population. Blood
coagulation in these patients thus appears to be altered, and
FDP, including DD, can be predictive of disease progression. Therefore,
the routine monitoring of such markers is advisable in patients
with COVID-19, this result being similar to those found by
Tang, Li, Wang and Sun6. As a result of the
presumed prothrombotic status of many patients, there was a drastic
increase in the demand for laboratory tests to monitor coagulation
parameters, vascular ultrasound tests and other imaging methods in patients
positive for COVID-19. This study aims to gather information about
the routine work of vascular specialists and reference centers in
the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used the following
search criteria: “Coronavirus and venous thrombosis”, “Coronavirus and thrombosis”, “COVID-19
and venous thrombosis” and “COVID-19 Coronavirus and thrombosis”.
