During the current COVID-19 pandemic, phone and/or e-mail contact have
been established with most patients at both Hospital das Clínicas
da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo and
Faculdade de Ciências Médicas da Santa Casa de São Paulo.
This contact has allowed direct interaction between patient and caregiver
in order to reschedule future appointments, check the results of
laboratory tests and imaging, address patient’s complaints, perform drug monitoring/management,
and provide information concerning the pandemic.
