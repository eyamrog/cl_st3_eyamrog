This perspective faced to the COVID-19 pandemic and after its
passage supports educators and learners in issues regarding mental health.
In brief logical reasoning, the engagement of brain areas involved
with emotions, such as the limbic system, associated with the
possibility of viral transmission between neurons, damages the release process
of important neurotransmitters such as glutamate and acetylcholine (excitatory), GABA
and dopamine (inhibitors), in addition to serotonin (excitatory and inhibitory)
and glial cells (which respond to environmental stimuli). Thus, it
is assumed that SARS-CoV-2 may affect brain networks (or circuits)
making them less effective, reflecting in afferent and efferent projections
fundamental to the learning path (73).
