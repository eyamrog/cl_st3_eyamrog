Table 1 describes the 151 survey participants completing the first
main page of the questionnaire. Most of them were 35â€“44
years old (38%) and male (55%); most participants were from
Brazil (97%) and, in general, their most advanced degree was
undergraduate or medical school (40%). All of them belonged to
at least one stakeholder group: 57% were SBMFC members, 54%
were readers, 28% were authors, and 33% were reviewers. Most
participants did not have any experience with open identity (83%),
open reports (81%), or open participation (90%) as authors or
reviewers, even though 60 (39%) reported having experience both as
authors and reviewers with open peer review in general. Two-thirds
of the survey participants were satisfied with peer review in
RBMFC.
