In summary, the cellular mechanisms associated with coronaviruses replication form
a complex and integrated network of molecular events, starting from
the translation of Nsps, proteolytic cleavage of polyproteins, assemble of
RTC, transcription of antigenome, genome and subgenomic RNAs, translation of
structural proteins and finally viral particles assembly and budding. The
analysis of the cellular proteins related to coronaviruses proteins reveals
the modulation of key cellular pathways related to innate immunity,
cell cycle, and protein synthesis. The current therapeutic approaches for
COVID19 are partially related to these molecular events and pathways,
but future pharmacological interventions may take advantage of a better
understanding regarding the replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2.
