The two-dimensional model consisting of eleven items showed adequate goodness-of-fit
indices and the latent correlation between the two dimensions was
also within the appropriate values (less than 0.80, see Table
3). The first dimension was made up from eight items
related to satisfaction with the physicianÂ´s working conditions (i.e. workload,
hours, salary) and the second dimension had three items related
to structural working conditions (i.e. infrastructure, equipment). From this analysis
it was possible to conclude that this model presented adequate
evidence of validity based on its internal structure and, therefore,
was considered for further analysis (see Figure 1).
