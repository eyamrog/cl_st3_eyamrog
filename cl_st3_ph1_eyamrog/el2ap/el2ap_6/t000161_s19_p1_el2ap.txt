A small fraction of the 123 taxonomic journals investigated adopt
mandatory APC-GOA models (18.7%). DOA represents 22.0%, while the largest
amount (59.3%) of journals are based on hybrid models with
paywall to access their content, usually through readers’ payment/subscription (Table
1). A few journals, published in distinct platforms maintained by
societies, require page charges to authors, irrespective of them being
associated or not to the society, and they also have
their contents protected by paywall; thus, these journals have both
authors’ and readers’ charges (e.g., Journal of the Kansas Entomological
Society and Malacologia).
