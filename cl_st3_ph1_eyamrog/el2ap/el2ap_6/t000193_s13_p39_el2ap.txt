In addition to social distancing, we believe certain measures may
lead to infection prophylaxis. Vaccination should be administered to mitigate
infection risk in immunosuppressed/immunomodulated patients whenever possible. Vaccination schedule suggestions
for patients with demyelinating diseases have been previously published63. In
general, the same principles adopted for patients with systemic autoimmune
diseases are followed, such as avoiding live virus/bacterial vaccines64,65,66. We
underline that vaccine effectiveness may be compromised in patients under
certain disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), such as fingolimod, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies,
natalizumab, alemtuzumab, and cladribine.
