Epidemics have the potential to severely strain intensive care resources
and may require an increase in intensive care capability. Few
intensivists have direct experience of rapidly expanding intensive care services
in response to an epidemic. Early preparations should include fit
testing of negative pressure respirators, training of reserve staff, sourcing
of material for physical modifications to the ICU, among other
[7].
