The lower numbers of cases and deaths by COVID-19 in
countries that have a BCG vaccination program in place is
instigating and biologically plausible. So far, with pandemic numbers in
progress, a correlation has been found between the coverage of
such programs and the number of cases and deaths in
the countries studied over the two consecutive months. Prospective and
controlled studies should be stimulated quickly, as BCG may be
the main weapon for severe case prevention until a specific
vaccine is developed.
