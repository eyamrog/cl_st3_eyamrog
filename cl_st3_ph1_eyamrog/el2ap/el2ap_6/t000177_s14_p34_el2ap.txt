Taylor et al [35] correlated mid-range humidity levels with improved
mammalian immunity against respiratory infections. Mousavi et al [36] reported
that RH values between 40% and 60% are most unfavorable
climatic conditions for microorganismsâ€™ survival. A proper selection, operation, and
maintenance of humidification equipment is required when water vapor is
introducted in the indoor environment to achieve the mid-range humidity
levels associated with decreased infections. Using the SARS study as
a basis, the relationship between relative humidity and virus activation
is understandable [35, 36].
