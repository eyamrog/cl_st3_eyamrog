The first study of the diversity of freshwater hyphomycetes in
Brazilian insular areas was conducted by Moro et al. (2018)
for the Ilhabela State Park (PEIb). In this same island,
two new species of freshwater Hyphomycetes, Polylobastipora setulosa (Moro et
al. 2015a) and Campylospora brasiliensis (Moro et al. 2015b) were
described, as well as the first report from Brazil Peyronelina
glomerulata PJ Fisher, J. Webster & DF Kane (Moro et
al. 2015c).
