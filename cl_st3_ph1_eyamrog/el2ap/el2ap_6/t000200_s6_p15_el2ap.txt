It is noteworthy, however, that the morbidity data related to
leptospirosis may be underestimated in this analysis, due to the
fact that this is a disease that can be confused
with other febrile conditions. In addition, most of the notifications
are from hospital records, consequently of those cases that exhibit
more severe forms of the illness.
