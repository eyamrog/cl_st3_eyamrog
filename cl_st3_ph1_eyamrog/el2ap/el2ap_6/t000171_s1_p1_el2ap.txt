Introduction: A novel type of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is responsible for
an unprecedented pandemic with profound socioeconomic consequences. Owing to its
recent discovery, the virus that emerged in the Chinese city
of Wuhan in December 2019 still represents a great unknown
to researchers. This study aims to establish the spatio- temporal
associations of the incidence, mortality, and the rate of both
rapid and RT-PCR tests in Minas Gerais.
