Besides pp1ab, S, E, M, and N proteins, SARS-CoV-2 present
at least 5 more ORFs, called ORF3a, ORF6a, ORF7a/7b, ORF8,
and ORF10, which much less information is known regarding their
molecular mechanisms of action in the viral replication cycle. SARS-CoV
ORF3a is reported to bind to TRAF3 and ASC, promoting
TRAF3 ubiquitination and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Siu et
al. 2019). Other studies have demonstrated that ORF3a presents binding
affinities for caveolin-1 and calcium (Padhan et al. 2007; Minakshi
et al. 2014). SARS-CoV ORF6 is localized in the ER
and Golgi membranes in infected cells, binding to karyopherin alpha
2 and karyopherin beta 1 proteins and hindering STAT1 nuclear
import and its function (Frieman et al. 2007). Another study
showed that nsp8 interacts with ORF6, suggesting that ORF6 protein
plays a role in virus replication (Kumar et al. 2007).
