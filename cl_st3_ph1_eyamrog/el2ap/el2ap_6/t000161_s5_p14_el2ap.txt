In addition, Chorus & Waltman (2016) carefully studied journal self-citation
and proposed a measure to evaluate boosts in the JIF,
detecting disproportional and potentially unethical behavior (“Impact Factor Biased Self-Citation
Practices”). They did not consider their measure unfailing and discussed
a few cases when self-citation would be legitimated. The latter
include distinct situations. For instance, a researcher could be inspired
by recent studies published in a journal and thus decides
to conduct similar research; accordingly, that journal would naturally be
an important source and his/her first choice for publication. Also,
there are situations when, after finishing a manuscript, an author
realizes that most of the cited references are from a
given journal; the latter becomes again a naturally expected option.
We believe that such cases are strongly associated to the
Zootaxa mega-journal phenomenon and appear to partially explain its high
levels of self-citation.
