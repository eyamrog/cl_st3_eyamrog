Several drugs have recently been used to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication,
including the adenosine analog remdesivir, which targets the RNA dependent
RNA polymerase and is incorporated into viral RNA chains, resulting
in premature termination. Remdesivir was firstly shown to be effective
against the Ebola virus (Warren et al. 2016) but presents
activity against other viruses, including members of the Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae,
Pneumoviridae, and Orthocoronavirinae families (Brown et al. 2019). Remdesivir inhibits
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Sheahan et al. 2017), even though the
identity among the coronaviruses RdRps range from 70-90%, remdesivir shows
a broad spectrum of activity (Brown et al. 2019). Recently,
a study showed that remdesivir also acts against SARS-CoV-2, according
to its potential antiviral mechanism as a nucleotide analog (Wang
et al. 2020b). Other nucleotide analogs, such as Ribavirin, Sofosbuvir,
Galidesivir, and Tenofovir, can bind to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (Elfiky 2020).
Favipiravir, a purine analog used against Influenza, is being tested
against COVID-19 and reduced the time for viral clearance compared
to patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir (Cai et al. 2020). There
are currently ongoing clinical trials to evaluate Remdesivir and Ribavirin
against COVID-19, regardless of its cost and administration routes there
are also concerns regarding its side effects and efficacy (Khalili
et al. 2020).
