On the other hand, Xu et al (2016) [37], when
evaluating 2,694 children and adults in Hong Kong, did not
find an association between the lowest serum concentrations of 25(OH)D
(<50nmol/l) and the risk of infections by influenza virus (RR:
1.15; 95%CI: 0.73;1.83; p=0.55) after adjusting for age, sex, chronic
disease, and vaccination history. However, the authors observed an association
with the incidence of influenza-like symptoms (presence of fever ≥37.8ºC
and cough or sore throat) (RR: 1.70; 95%CI: 1.14;2.51; p=0.01).
