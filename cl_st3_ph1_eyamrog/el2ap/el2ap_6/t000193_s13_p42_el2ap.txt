Immunosuppressive therapies are being studied as cytokine storm inhibitors for
the adjunctive treatment of severe cases of COVID-19 infection (e.g.,
fingolimod – clinical trial ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier: NCT04280588). Interferons – MS
DMDs – have antiviral properties and are of research interest
in this pandemic (ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier: NCT04343768, NCT04350671). Also, drugs used
to treat NMOSD are currently being evaluated in confirmed COVID-19
infected patients with severe pneumonia and SARS: tocilizumab (ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier:
NCT04317092), eculizumab (ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier: NCT04288713), and intravenous methylprednisolone (ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier:
ChiCTR2000029386). However, the theoretical protective effects of MS/NMOSD DMDs for
COVID-19 infections remain to be proven. Until further information is
available, we suggest stopping DMDs during severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. In
moderate and mild cases, DMD discontinuation should be individualized according
to the aforementioned drug-safety profiles, patient’s age, and other comorbidities.
At this time, any drug that may interfere with immune
response cannot be considered completely safe in a symptomatic patient.
