Comparisons of behavioral responses observed in the arena 1 were
made using one-tailed binomial test. Comparison of behavioral responses for
each species in the arenas 2 and 3 were made
using two-tailed binomial test. A chi-square test of independence was
performed to examine the relation between the Belminus species and
orientation responses in arenas 2 and 3. When dependence resulted
insignificant in the previous test, Belminus species were treated as
a single group –as a genus– for a two-tailed binomial
test. When dependence resulted significant, multiple chi-square pairwise comparisons were
performed among species, after post hoc Holm- Bonferroni correction (Ruxton
and Beauchamp 2008). Statistical analyses were analyzed using R (version
3.5.3, Vienna, Austria; Ihaka and Gentleman 1996).
