The low activation of IFN pathway is mediated by viral
regulation of IRF3, a transcription factor activated by phosphorylation or
polyubiquitination, and then translocates to the nucleus and induces the
IFN response genes (Chattopadhyay et al. 2016). The SARS-CoV PLpro
inhibits IRF3 phosphorylation, preventing its nuclear translocation and disrupting IFN
response, probably through inhibition of STING (stimulator of interferon genes),
that is responsible for IRF3 phosphorylation (Chen et al. 2014).
Nsp3 DUB domain of MHV-A59 and SARS-CoV promotes deubiquitination of
IRF3 and also prevents its activation, blocking NF-κBsignaling (Frieman et
al. 2009). PLpro of MERS-CoV has also been described to
inhibit IRF3 nuclear translocation (Yang et al. 2014). Interferon inhibition
makes PLpro an important determinator of virulence of coronavirus (Niemeyer
et al. 2018). SARS-CoV Nsp1 protein also participates in IFN
inhibition through decreasing STAT1 phosphorylation (Wathelet et al. 2007). While
ORF3a protein induces ER stress, activates PERK (PKR-like ER Kinase),
and promotes phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of IFNAR1, attenuating interferon
response (Minakshi et al. 2009). The SARS-CoV N protein has
also been described to inhibit IFN production at an early
step, by sequestering PACT (protein activator of the dsRNA activated
protein kinase R) and TRIM25 (tripartite motif protein 25), which
bind to RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducer gene I) and MDA5 (melanoma
differentiation gene 5) and activate IFN production (Ding et al.
2017). Finally, ORF4b of MERS-CoV is another protein that has
been characterized to inhibit IFN and NF-κB signaling (Matthews et
al. 2014).
