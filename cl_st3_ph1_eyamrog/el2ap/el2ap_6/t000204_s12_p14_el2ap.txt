Fear is composed of several variables and determinants and the
study of neurobiological structures involved in its genesis is complex.
One of the particularities associated with stress, fear and anxiety
is the generalisation phenomenon that can have an adaptive value.
However, overgeneralisation is inadequate and is one of the main
characteristics of mental disease such as post-traumatic stress disorder (23).
In this understanding, the maladaptive generalisation of fear occurs when
an abnormal stimulus-response gradient emerges to produce defensive behaviours in
environments or clues that are not explicitly associated with threat
or danger (24).
