Notes: the conidia of I. quadricellularia are morphologically similar to
those of the genus Wiesneriomyces Koord. The difference between these
fungi is that in I. quadricellularia the conidiophores are free,
and Wiesneriomyces presents sporodochium. However, W. laurinus (Tassi) P.M. Kirk
may have 5-9 cells composing the conidia in culture medium
or 7-8 cells in the natural substrate as noted by
Matsushima (1975), more than 15 cells as described by Ellis
(1971). Matsushima (1975) described 4 cells or rarely 5 cells
for I. quadricellularia conidia. In the present research, although the
conidiophore was not observed, the 4 cells conidia agree with
the original description of Matsushima (1975) for I. quadricellularia, allowing
the identification of the collected fungus.
