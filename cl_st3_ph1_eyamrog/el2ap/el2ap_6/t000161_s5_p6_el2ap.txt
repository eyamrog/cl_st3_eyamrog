Taxonomy is known as a science in crisis affected by
losses of positions in institutions and reduction of funding resources.
In addition to this scenario of gradual loss of workforce
and grants, the discipline is also damaged by the biases
or inadequacies of these so-called indexes of “quality” (see Ebach
et al. 2011). Some solutions for low citations suggested the
mandatory citation of references in which authorities erected new taxa
(original descriptions) whenever a name was mentioned in a study,
a rule endorsed by Zootaxa but not strictly enforced by
the journal. This rule would partially explain its high level
of self- citations. However, this strategy is deeply misleading, because
original descriptions, especially the old ones, are often not adequate
for species characterization and recognition. A more straightforward approach would
be to make clear which concept of species is being
adopted and provide the bibliographic source (see Meier 2017). Another
important point is that multidisciplinarity in biological sciences has blurred
the limits among traditional disciplines, even the descriptive ones. All
these aspects were suggested as reasonable explanations for the high
levels of Zootaxa self-citations. However, they are not valid because
there are many other journals currently accepting taxonomic studies, being
either purely descriptive or including broader analytical approaches; these journals
are obviously attractive in the context of the JIF mania
game (Supplementary File 1).
