2) The RTC may, however, temporarily pause the transcription in
each of the TRS regions of each ORF and continue
in the 5’-UTR of the genome, given the complementarity of
the TRS regions. Therefore, a leader region is incorporated in
each RNA, generating subgenomic RNAs of negative polarity. These subgenomic
RNAs will serve as a template for mRNA (+) synthesis,
containing their 3’ regions co-terminal to the genomic RNA (figure
2, processes 2a and 2b). This process is often called
“copy- choice” mechanism and is presented in other viruses, allowing
recombination, as it will be discussed later (Simon-Loriere and Holmes
2011).
