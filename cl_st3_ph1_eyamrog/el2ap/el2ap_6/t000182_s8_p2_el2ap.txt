Triatomine bugs have a unique way of life, they are
nest-living ectoparasites (Guerin et al. 2000) and vectors of Trypanosoma
cruzi (Kinetoplastida, Trypanosomatidae) –the causative agent of Chagas disease. Triatomines
usually live closely associated with their host, sharing the same
refuge and, constantly feeding on the same source during the
course of their life. In natural conditions most triatomine species
bite humans and other vertebrate hosts during the night while
they sleep. These blood-sucking bugs acquire the zoonosis by biting
an infected vertebrate host (e.g, opossums, armadillos and bats, among
others). In the bug the parasite goes into a specialized
stage, the epimastigote, which moves onto the rectum where it
becomes infectious (Schofield et al. 1987). Infectious T. cruzi are
called metacyclic trypomastigotes. Triatomines defecate during feeding or shortly after
feeding, thus vectoring the parasites by defecating on another host.
The trypomastigotes in the feces are capable of swimming into
the host's cells using flagella. They enter the human host
through the bite wound or by crossing mucous membranes. The
parasite T. cruzi is able to live in the gut
of all triatomines, however, some bug species are more efficient
vectors than others due to different factors such as, triatomine
density, host preference (Gütler et al. 2009) and defecation index
–i .e., time between feeding and defecation (Aldana and Lizano
2004).
