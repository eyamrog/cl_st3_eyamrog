We consider that the creation of the Network is the
result of having overcome obstacles for the group and the
organization with fellow professionals, leading to the abandonment of invisibility.
The reports compiled show a true understanding of the effects
that silencing produces, silencing which then turns into isolation and
the social reproduction of discredit. Belonging to the Network enhances
professional identity inasmuch as these professionals can support one another
and contribute to the goal of defeating the discredit they
could face.
