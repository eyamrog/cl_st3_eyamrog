In any case, there are two works made up to

practices 2013, prepared by the Organization of Ibero-American States, based
on the work of the Ibero-American Observatory of Culture (OIBC)
with the collaboration of Latino Bar√≥metro, that collects a sample
about Ecuador; and the analysis of habits and cultural practices
in the Machala canton 2014, capital of El Oro.
