However, volatiles emanating from cockroach feces attracted B. corredori (P=0.019)
and B. ferroae (P=0.003), while B. herreri did not show
attraction or avoidance behaviors (P=0.0541). The chi-square test of independence
showed that there was a significant relation between species and
behavioral responses (P=0.0208). When performing multiple pairwise comparisons, chi- square
tests showed that the behavioral responses of B. corredori and
B. ferroae were not different (P=0.766), the behavioral responses of
B. corredori and B. herreri were not different (P=0.0683), and
the behavioral responses of B. ferroae and B. herreri were
different (P=0.0392) (Fig 3).
