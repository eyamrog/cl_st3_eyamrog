A recent literature review [46], discussing the evidence on vitamin
D supplementation during COVID-19 pandemic, proposed that, in the hospital
setting, patients and staff should take vitamin D supplements to
increase 25(OH)D for at least 40–50ng/mL (100–125nmol/L). To achieve these
concentrations, the authors suggested taking 10,000IU/d for a month and
then decrease to 5,000IU/d for maintenance. However, it is stated
that “The hypothesis that vitamin D supplementation can reduce the
risk of influenza and COVID-19 incidence and death should be
investigated in trials to determine the appropriate doses, serum 25(OH)D
concentrations, and the presence of any safety issues.”
