The collaborative analysis considered the countries that had at least
5 productions, so only 24 (36.36%) composed the collaborative map
(Figure 3). The same number of countries published only one
document. Figure 3 represents this distribution, with the formation of
six clusters divided by different colors. Of this group, Brazil
is the only Latin American representative, however, its collaboration only
occurs with Italy and Germany, although it shares the same
cluster with other countries such as Belgium, Spain, France and
the Netherlands. This cluster made up of seven countries has
published 306 documents, representing 18.85% of the total documents recovered
in this study.
