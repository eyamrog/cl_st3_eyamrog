A randomized controlled Israeli study showed that the incidence was
not different among young people born three years before and
three years after the interruption of their vaccination program. The
authors discuss that the results cannot be used to assess
the impact or severity of COVID-19. The conclusion of this
study only reaffirms the results found here because the accelerations
of cases were not different in situations where the mortality
and lethality ratios were (Table 2). This fact reinforces the
idea that the BCG vaccine does not prevent the spread
of the disease, but probably protects from a severe outcome8.
