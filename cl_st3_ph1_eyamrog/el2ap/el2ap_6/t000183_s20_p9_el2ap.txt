Locally, Tirado (2013) implemented a study about the use of
active techniques to enhance reading comprehension in fifth year English
learners in a primary school. In this study, it was
found that the application of traditional techniques discourages students when
reading; however, children also showed interest in learning to read
better. That study, among others, has inspired teachers to find
ways to provide EFL learners with proper strategies to read
better. Since graphic organizers are tools that facilitate the organization
or information or the establishment of relationships between elements of
a text such as facts, examples, definitions, sequences, among others,
their use allows the readers break down the content of
the reading while they think about the information they are
getting from the text. Using them, definitely improved the levels
of reading comprehension in the experimental group, as it can
be observed in table N. 3.
