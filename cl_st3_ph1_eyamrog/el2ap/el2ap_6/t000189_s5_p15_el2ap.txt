Clinical trials on vitamin D supplementation that assessed the prevention
of respiratory infections and/or the severity of the disease indicated
heterogeneous results [40-44], which can be explained by the varying
doses of vitamin D (400 to 100.000 IU per day,
week and/or single dose), and protocol duration (5 days to
8 months). However, a meta-analysis including 25 randomized controlled trials
and totaling 10,933 participants showed a protective effect of vitamin
D supplementation against acute respiratory tract infection [45].
