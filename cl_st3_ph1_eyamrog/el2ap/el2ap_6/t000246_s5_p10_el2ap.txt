Applying the Bradford's Law to verify the behavior of the
distribution/dispersion of journals, in Table 3, it was possible to
identify, from the Bradford Multiplier (Bm), a constant, since the
variation between the Bm of the Zones remained within the
allowed oscillation 5-9 0.7, demonstrating a distribution very close to
the ideal (I:n:n2), as determined by the Law. The Nucleus
comprised 15 periodicals, being these the most devoted to the
subject 9-10.
