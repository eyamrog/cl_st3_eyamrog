Non-enhanced chest CT is considered to be the first-line imaging
tool for evaluation of COVID-19 pneumonia3. Some ancillary findings on
non-enhanced CT, such as peripheral lung opacities with features suggestive
of pulmonary infarction (reversed halo sign/central lucencies), dilatation of pulmonary
trunk, and increased cardiac volume (particularly, enlargement of right cardiac
chamber) should indicate risk of PE12. These aspects, as observed
in our patient, may aid in the decision to perform
CT pulmonary angiography to confirm or exclude PE. Moreover, clinical
parameters, including elevated D-dimer levels, hemoptysis, and sudden worsening of
respiratory function or chest pain should also be considered3,9. Additionally,
signs of right heart strain on electrocardiogram or echocardiogram may
help in identifying patients with COVID-19 at risk of concurrent
PE9. Whereas, contraindications associated with the use of intravenous iodinated
contrast media, including allergy (prior allergy-like reaction to iodinated contrast
medium) and renal dysfunction, should be weighed in the decision
to perform CTPA3,9.
