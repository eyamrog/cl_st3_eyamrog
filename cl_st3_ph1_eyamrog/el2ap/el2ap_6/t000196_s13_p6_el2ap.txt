Brazil counts on the PNAE (National School Feeding Program), a
social program linked to the Education Ministry (implemented in 1955)
that seeks to guarantee students enrolled in public schools and
philanthropic entities an adequate and healthy meal. Other alternatives to
promote nutrition for children and adolescents have been developed as
well, such as micronutrient fortified cookies produced in Vietnam that,
according to research, have reduced the prevalence of anemia and
improved the status of iron intake [15].
