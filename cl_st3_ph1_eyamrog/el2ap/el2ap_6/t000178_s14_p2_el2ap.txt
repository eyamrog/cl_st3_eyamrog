BioProject data was also retrieved using Entrez Direct and the
command <esearch -db BioProject -query "Peru" | efetch -format xml
| xtract -pattern DocumentSummary -element Project \ -block Organism -element
OrganismName Supergroup \ -block Submission -element Name > BioProject.xml>, and
processed using awk scripts. Both, BOLD and PATRIC data were
retrieved directly from their webpages, using “Peru” as a search
query. This data was downloaded in tabular (tsv) and comma-separated
(csv) formats, respectively. For both datasets, cat and grep scripts
were used. cat concatenates texts to create a new output,
and grep -c, counts the occurrences of a certain word
query. awk scripts were additionally used for the BOLD dataset
to group and count most sequenced taxonomic orders per institution.
For the PATRIC dataset, csvgrep was used to count sequenced
organisms per institution. All code and scripts are available in
this GitHub repository: https://github.com/reymonera/mining_peru_sequence_DB. Finally, we searched in the Scopus
reference database (https://www.scopus.com) for records with the term “genetic diversity”
produced by at least one Peruvian institution.
