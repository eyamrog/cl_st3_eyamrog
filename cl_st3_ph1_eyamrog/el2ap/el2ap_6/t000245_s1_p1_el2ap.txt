(Additions to the knowledge of Ganodermataceae in brazilian Cerrado) -
As a cosmopolitan family, Ganodermataceae has as distinctive characteristic the
presence of double-walled basidiospore: the inner wall thick and ornamented,
and the outer wall smooth. Even with the increasing interest
in this family, the species are still poorly known in
different regions of the brazilian territory, such as in the
central Brazil. This study presents new distribution remarks of Ganodermataceae
species in different sites of the biome Cerrado, in the
Midwest region. We found 23 specimens from five species which
are distributed into three genera, Amauroderma, Foraminispora and Ganoderma. From
those species, one is a new record for the Cerrado
(A. exile), four are new for the State of Goiás
A. exile, F. rugosa, G. multiplicatum and G. stipitatum and
one for the Distrito Federal (G. stipitatum). Amauroderma aurantiacum is
rediscovered in Goiás after 88 years. This study contributes to
improving the knowledge regarding the geographic distribution of these taxa
in Brazil.
