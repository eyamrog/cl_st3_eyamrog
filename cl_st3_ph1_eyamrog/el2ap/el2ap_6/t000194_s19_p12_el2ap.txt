Notes: the genus Isthmolongispora was described by Matsushima (1971) for
the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea, together with I.
intermedia and I. minima. The genus is characterized by the
presence of free conidiophores and conidial serials, formed by cells
connected by a small isthmus. Currently, the genus is composed
of nine other species. This is the first record of
the species for Brazil.
