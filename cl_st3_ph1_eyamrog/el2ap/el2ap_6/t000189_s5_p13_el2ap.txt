Cochrane review published by Chen et al. [39] demonstrated unexpected
effects for megadose supplementation (100.000-206.000 IU/day) or low doses (5.000
IU/day or 8.333-10.000 IU/week or 20.000-45.000 IU every two months)
of vitamin A in children from 0 to 7 years
old. The results showed no effect and some of the
studies revealed exacerbation of clinical symptoms (cough with fever, tachypnea
and higher incidence of acute respiratory infections) in children who
used vitamin supplementation. The authors report that beneficial effects may
be more prominent in children with pre-existing malnutrition, concluding that
low doses of vitamin A leads to fewer side effects
and shows similar benefits to those found in megadose supplementation.
