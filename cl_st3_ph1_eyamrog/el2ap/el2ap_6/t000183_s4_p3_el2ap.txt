Following the implementation of reading activities with graphic organizers during
6 weeks, most of the students in the experimental group
demonstrated acceptance and comprehension of how these tools are used.
They also showed significant improvement in the development of their
receptive skills, such as listening and concentration, their reading comprehension
and their learning skills, for example decoding and understanding vocabulary
and relating content to previous knowledge.
