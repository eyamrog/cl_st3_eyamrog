Gender differences (higher levels of fear and distress among female
respondents) could be interpreted as a social construction. It is
possible that men, because not openly expressing their fears of
the Covid-19, would not follow the preventive sanitary recommendations that
the World Health Organization (WHO) uses to manage the spread
of the coronavirus infection (WHO, 2008): minimizing the risk communication
efforts of the authorities and media, not following hygiene practices,
and social distancing â€“ risk factors of the pandemic control.
