RBMFC authors and reviewers were much more likely to disagree
than to agree with open identities being fairer to authors
(see Supplemental Table 2 in Fontenelle (2020b)), whereas participants of
Ross-Hellauer (2017) were as likely to agree as to disagree.
The difference is probably due to RBMFC adopting double-blind review,
which has been consistently reported as the preferred form of
peer review in researcher surveys (Mulligan et al., 2013; Pontille;
Torny, 2014; Tennant et al., 2017; Bernal; Román-Molina, 2018;). Switching
a natural science journal from single-blind to double-blind was found
to attenuate bias in peer review against female authors and
might benefit other author demographics as well (Pontille; Torny, 2014;
Tennant et al., 2017). On the other hand, blinding reviewers
to authors’ identities cannot avoid bias when the blinding fails,
nor can it avoid bias against the manuscripts’ contents, such
as the conclusions or the theoretical approach (Pontille; Torny, 2014;
Tennant et al., 2017). Perhaps more importantly, there is no
evidence on the effect of open identities on bias in
peer review.
