Despite the assistance provided to students, whether in the form
of prepared meals, meal kits, or financial aid, some issues
still need to be addressed, such as: the actual destination
of the aid (whether the students will personally benefit from
this assistance), the nutritional content and amount of food in
the meal kits, and the difficulties that the family can
face in receiving the benefit and preparing food.
