Results: We demonstrate that the SDS adopted in São Paulo
City and State clearly brought meaningful results to delay the
growth of COVID-19 cases. We also show that by using
this type of time series it is possible to identify
different trends for regions, allowing for targeted approaches. Additionally, by
using a time series which is death-oriented makes it possible
to identify, for São Paulo City, the effects of the
SDS with the Social Isolation Index (SII) adopted in the
state and to make a gross estimate for the SII,
which prevents the growth of the disease.
