We do not recommend stopping DMDs for patients already under
treatment. Stopping fingolimod and natalizumab is associated with rebound31,32. Rebound
can lead to higher disability, hospitalization, and further immunosuppression (i.e.,
intravenous methylprednisolone), exposing patients to a higher risk of severe
COVID-19 infection.
