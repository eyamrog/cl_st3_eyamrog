21.7% Of university students tested devote between three and four
hours a day to the use of the smartphone, 19.6%
more than six hours and 16.9% between five and six.
This time is distributed almost equally between academic activities (67.8%)
and social networks (69.6%) (see Figure 6). Among the activities
of leisure and free time made through the cell phone,
we should highlight taking pictures or videos (92.9%) and listening
to music (74.9%). While these rates are below 50% related
to other activities such as viewing videos, in terms of
television and radio, we can state that 71.2% of the
population watches television and 61% listens to the radio. However,
those same activities carried out through the cell phone are
rated below 10%.
