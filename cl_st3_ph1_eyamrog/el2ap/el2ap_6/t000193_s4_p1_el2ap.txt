The current COVID-19 pandemic is challenging the way we traditionally
treat and monitor patients with CNS demyelinating diseases. At this
moment, there is no evidence that infected MS or NMOSD
patients present a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19. Nonetheless,
caution and vigilance are necessary, as these patients are frequently
immunosuppressed. In addition, their management requires adaptation during the pandemic
in order to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection whilst maintaining treatment safety
and efficacy.
