People from different countries experience various levels of stress, fear,
or anguish. As an example, fear in China during the
pandemic differs from that in Iran, Italy, and Spain, indicating
the need to study mental health predictors in specific countries
during the Covid-19 to effectively identify, track, and assist those
people most susceptible to mental health problems (Jahanshahi et al,
2020; Maza et al, 2020; Qiu et al, 2020; Wang
et al, 2020).
