Accordingly, MS/NMOSD patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 should be treated following
updated COVID-19 guidelines. In fact, current management of COVID-19 is
supportive. Since potential treatment benefits of antivirals are not evidence-based
(e.g., chloroquine derivatives or remdesivir) and data regarding interactions with
DMDs are lacking, we do not recommend their use.
