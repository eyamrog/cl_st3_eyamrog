The Network is constantly growing; thus, it is expanding its
territorial presence. The wide geographical distribution of the members is
a key element to making the possibilities for accessing abortion

rural areas, isolated destinations, indigenous and campesino communities, where the
Legal Interruption of Pregnancy, at a public institution, has powerful
symbolic effects in the community.
