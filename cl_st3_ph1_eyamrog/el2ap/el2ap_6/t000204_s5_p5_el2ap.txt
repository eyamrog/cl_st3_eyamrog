Faced with a complex reality where confinement is the main
prophylactic means to prevent the virus spreading (2, 77), educators
and learners develop new behaviours of adaptation and appropriateness, where
physiological transformations are produced in response to the outbreak. From
fear to courage (and vice-versa), the process of resistance or
"struggle" to confront the COVID-19, demands cognitive-affective attention to contain
the exponential increase of fears and insecurities that generate psychic
suffering.
