The ability to track the spread of the disease in
time, even with some delay, allows for a better understanding
of how to analyze, develop, and implement strategies to confront
the epidemic. For São Paulo City, Table 1 shows a
measurement of its spread in terms of addi­ tional deaths
per day, and the corresponding social distancing index measured 15
days before. From such data, it is possible to make
a gross estimation for the SDI value, which will slow
down the spread of the disease. It appears that at
a SDI between 52 and 56%, makes the pro­ gression
of the disease to cross the break-even point: an SDI
of 56% causes decrease deaths 0.40 per day, whereas an
SDI of 52% increase deaths to 0.82 per day. For
the normal-life period (before March 16th) the disease progressed at
a rate of 3.18 deaths per day. The values obtained
from this gross estimate should be analyzed with care, because
the spread of the disease is affected by other factors
beyond the SDI and it is not known how the
SDI relates specifically to the transmission rate of the virus,
so that similar values of SDI might result in different
transmission rates for different environments, for example when temperature, humidity,
population density, and use of masks11 changes.
