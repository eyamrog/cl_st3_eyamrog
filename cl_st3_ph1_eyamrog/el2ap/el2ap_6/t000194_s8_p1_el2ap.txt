The term ‘aquatic hyphomycetes’ has not taxonomical value, but it
characterizes, ecologically, a group of anamorphic fungi or asexual ascomycetes
that must have, at least, a part or all of
their life cycle occurring in freshwater, including also fungi exclusively
originated in the aquatic environment (Chan et al. 2000).
