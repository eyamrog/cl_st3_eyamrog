We estimated that states located in the southeast and north
regions will see a substantial increase in the rate of
cumulative COVID-19 deaths up to 5.39, 13.36, and 4.20 times
in a month and 11.23, 15.97 and 4.41-fold increases until
July 15, for Rio de Janeiro, Roraima and Par√°, respectively.
We also observed that the states of Amazonas (north region)
and Pernambuco (northeast region) are in the potential period of
stabilization of death cases with a slight increase in the
mortality rate (2.17 and 2.44, respectively), although it is predicted
that these states will still be among the states with
the highest death rate at the end of the period.
States located in the midwest and south regions will show
a more discreet increase in the modeling with the lowest
potential cumulative case rates until the end of the estimated
period.
