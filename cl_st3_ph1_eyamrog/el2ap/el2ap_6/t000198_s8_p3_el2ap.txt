One of the sectors hardest disrupted by the COVID -19
pandemic crisis was the area of health education. Dental education
was affected significantly. Given the high degree of uncertainty about
the natural history of the disease, and the need to
protect the health of students, staff and patients, actions such
as suspension of teaching, researching and other activities to campus
were taken using a range of strategies, which varied across
countries and the stage of the local epidemic curve. Moreover,
practice preparation, such as the review of Personal Protective Equipment
(PPE) protocols, the organisation of the pre and post clinical
environment, and clinical dental procedures were discussed and implemented. Numerous
and critical difficulties and challenges have arisen as a result
of the measures adopted that will have lasting effects. Facing
an unprecedented time in the dental education system worldwide, this
is an excellent opportunity to share new experiences, learn and
develop.
