The triad of informational, cognitive and socio-affective support during the
COVID-19 pandemic awakens to the importance of scientific education (75).
Information about the outbreak can generate problems, difficulties, disorders, and
disruptions in the teaching-learning process that can gradually produce persistent
changes in the behaviour of educators and learners. Thus, to
be meaningful, the relationship between educators and learners must mutually
produce appropriate responses adapted to sensory and emotional stimuli to
maintain the appropriate alert state for the content transmitted during
the pandemic (76).
