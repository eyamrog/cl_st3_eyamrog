Regarding fingolimod, upper and lower respiratory tract infections are known
for being more common in patients using this DMD. In
the pivotal trial37, lymphopenia was frequent, and lymphocyte counts were
measured monthly in the first trimester of use and every
three months thereafter. Fingolimod-related lymphopenia, however, has not been associated
with a higher incidence of infections38. Lymphocyte counts are not
direct markers of immunosuppression because they do not reflect absolute
lymphopenia but rather a redistribution of cells (lymphocyte retention in
lymph nodes). From our perspective, laboratory testing should be restricted
to the minimum necessary to mitigate coronavirus infection. We suggest
one complete blood count (CBC) three months after introducing the
treatment and every six months thereafter, aiming to keep lymphocytes
above 200 cells.
