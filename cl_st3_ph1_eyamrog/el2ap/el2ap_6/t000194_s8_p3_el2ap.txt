Aquatic anamorphs have been considered one of the most important
ecological group of fungi active during the decomposition process of
submerged leaf litter, as consumers or improving the palatability of
the substrates by nutritional enrichment for other organisms of the
trophic chain, such as shredding invertebrates (BÃ¤rlocher 1992, Cheng et
al. 1997, Suberkropp 1992, 2003). Therefore, these fungi may play
a very important role in nutrient cycling (Belliveau & Barlocher
2005).
