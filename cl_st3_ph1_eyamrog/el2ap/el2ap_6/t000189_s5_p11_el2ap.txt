The biochemical profile of vitamin D in patients diagnosed with
COVID-19 is still unknown. Thus, it is suggested that determining
vitamin D levels in baseline blood samples may be a
way of investigating the impact of vitamin D levels on
the prognosis of COVID-19 and justifying the possible therapeutic action
of vitamin D in the treatment of 2019-nCoV.
