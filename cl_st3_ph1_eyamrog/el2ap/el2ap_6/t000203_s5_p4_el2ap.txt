The new analysis included in the May 2020 evaluation with
non-BCGs countries (Fig. 3), where countries such as Belgium, the
United States, the Netherlands, and Italy, which have never had
vaccination programs, are compared to those that have discontinued their
programs. The result was consistent with the same acceleration of
cases and deaths (Table 3) but with higher incidence and
mortality (Table 2).
