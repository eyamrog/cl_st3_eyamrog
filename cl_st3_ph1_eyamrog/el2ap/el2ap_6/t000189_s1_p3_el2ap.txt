RESULTS: Six articles met the inclusion criteria, all of which
were related to deficiencies of vitamins A and D. In
general, vitamin A deficiency was associated with cough, fever, and
greater total respiratory resistance. Regarding vitamin D, the lack of
this nutrient led to higher rates of ICU admission, the
need for mechanical ventilation, and mortality. Evidence linking specific relationships
between nutritional deficiencies and COVID-19 remain lacking due to the
small number of studies and heterogeneities in population subgroups.
