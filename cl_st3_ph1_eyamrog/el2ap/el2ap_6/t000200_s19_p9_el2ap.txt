Upon observing the eight Health Regions with the highest rates
of leptospirosis and the greatest ratios of cases by precipitation
index, the average rate of leptospirosis ranged from 12.1 cases
per 100,000 inhabitants (higher rainfall levels) to 5.73 cases/100,000 inhabitants
(lower rainfall levels), a drop of 52.7%. On the other
hand, for the eight Health Regions with the lowest rates
and lowest rainfall indexes, this variation was 2.75 to 1.56
cases/100,000 inhabitants (a decrease of 43.3%).
