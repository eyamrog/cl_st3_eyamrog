A limitation in our approach, if it is to be
used for fast response decisions, is the delay which exists
between the death and the emission of the Death Certificate
and its filing in the Civil Registry database, which can
be as long as 15 days. We used the available
time series, which had the data as to the number
of deaths referenced to the date of the death, to
demonstrate that referencing to the date of the death was
relevant. We believe the authori­ ties might be able to
use primary data informing the causa mortis and referencing the
death to the date of death, as opposed to the
date in which the result of a PCR test was
made avail­ able. The point of our argument is not
that the ARPEN data should be used for policy—we used
ARPEN data to demonstrate that by referencing the deaths to
the date of the death more can be learned about
the evolution of the disease and the measures taken to
control it. It seems to us that by reporting information
about the deaths caused by ­COVID-19 ref­ erenced to the
test results date is distorting, and unnecessarily hindering the advance
of the understanding about the spread of the disease in
Brazil.
