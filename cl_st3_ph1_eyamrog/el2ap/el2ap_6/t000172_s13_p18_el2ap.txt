N protein is the only viral nucleocapsid protein and contains
two domains. The two structural domains of N protein, the
N-terminal RNA binding domain (RBD) (residues 45-181) and the C-terminal
dimerization domain (DD) (residues 248-365), do not interact with each
other and are surrounded by flexible linkers (Chang et al.
2006). It is reported that N protein can bind to
nsp3 to assist the binding of the viral genome to
the RTC and the packaging of the encapsidated genome in
virions (Hurst et al. 2009; Chen et al. 2020b). The
interaction between N and nsp3 supports a model in which
this interaction tethers the genome to newly translated RTCs at
an early stage of infection (Hurst et al. 2013). Besides,
one of the N protein domains is critical for the
recognition of the M protein during virus assembly in cells.
The interaction of N protein and viral nucleocapsid with the
membrane proteins S, E, and M for viral packaging takes
place in the ERGIC, forming the mature virions that are
then extruded from the cells by exocytosis via Golgi (de
Haan and Rottier 2005). The expression of N protein increases
the formation of VLPs, suggesting that the fusion of encapsidated
genomes in the ERGIC improves viral envelope formation (Siu et
al. 2008).
