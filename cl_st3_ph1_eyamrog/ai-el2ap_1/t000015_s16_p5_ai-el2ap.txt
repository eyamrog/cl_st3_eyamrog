To identify the publication languages of the JUOJS, Googleâ€™s Compact
Language Detector v3 (gcld3) was applied to the 100 most
recent articles in the ISSN-verified subset of JUOJS. Gcld3 is
a publicly available, pre-trained neural classifier that provides a reliability
flag for language predictions when the classification probability exceeds a
defined threshold. Only language classifications marked as reliable were retained
for each journal. The most frequently identified language for each
journal was assigned as its primary language of publication. Journals
with article abstracts classified by gcld3 as being in multiple
languages, with at least five articles per language, were designated
as multilingual. Additional heuristic checks were conducted to verify the
primary language of each journal, including comparison of predicted languages
with top-level domains, which led to the semi-manual correction of
478 journals. Two under-resourced languages, Balochi and Faroese, are not
currently supported by gcld3 and were instead identified through analysis
of top-level domains.
