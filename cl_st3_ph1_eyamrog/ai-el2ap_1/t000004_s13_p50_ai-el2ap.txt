Sandro began playing and singing, and we joined in at
the chorus, although we occasionally experienced difficulties with the singing
and maintaining the melody, which sometimes resulted in humorous situations.
During these moments, Sandro would exclaim, "Tá desafinado!" ("It’s out
of tune!") or "Tá ruim demais mas assim é que
se aprende!" ("It’s horrendous, but that is the way to
learn!") (Fieldnotes).
