Jeffrey Beall, a librarian at the University of Colorado Denver,
introduced the classification of "potential, possible, or probable predatory scholarly
OA publishers" and began maintaining a corresponding list in 2008.
This classification has significantly influenced the perception and evaluation of
journals from the Global South. As discussed in detail elsewhere
(Khanna & Willinsky, in press), there are two major lists
identifying so-called "predatory" journals: Beall's list, which was publicly available
until 2017, and Cabells' Predatory Reports, a subscription-based service launched
thereafter. Beall’s 2017 list includes 366 JUOJS (1.4% of the
total JUOJS), while Cabells’ Predatory Reports identifies 237 JUOJS (1.0%),
with 82 JUOJS appearing on both lists.
