The most significant increase in the number of journals and
articles occurred following the launch of Redalyc in 2005, which
began indexing journals primarily in the Social Sciences. As illustrated
in Figure 1, the highest point is observed in 2015,
indicating a marked rise compared to the relative stabilization of
the article count that began in 2011. The annual number
of articles and journals declines in 2018, which can be
attributed to a lag between publication and the incorporation of
new issues into the Redalyc and SciELO databases. This lag
varies considerably across publishers and countries and is attributable to
multiple factors, including publication delays, database management issues, challenges in
XML-JATS markup, and varying institutional priorities regarding the inclusion of
new issues in each database.
