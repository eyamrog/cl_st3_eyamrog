Consistent with Yin's (2016) findings, teachers reported genuine expressions of
negative emotion in response to inappropriate student behavior. These emotional
responses were categorized as either emotional authenticity or impulsive reaction
(acting out). Emotional authenticity refers to emotional expressions that are
contextually appropriate and typically associated with less severe incidents, such
as cell phone misuse or side conversations. However, there was
disagreement among teachers regarding the appropriateness of such displays. Some
teachers supported moderate emotional expression as a means to regulate
student behavior (Chang & Daves, 2009; Yin, 2016), while others
viewed it as inconsistent with the ethical standards of the
teaching profession (BuriÄ‡ et al., 2016; Sutton, 2004). Teachers who
reported practicing emotional authenticity also tended to rate themselves as
more effective and better connected with their students (Sutton, 2004;
Taxer & Frenzel, 2015). Evidence suggests that displaying authentic emotions,
when aligned with situational demands, may facilitate teachers' ability to
influence student behavior (hetero-regulation) and foster closer teacher-student relationships (Sutton,
2004; Yin, 2016). Therefore, emotional authenticity may represent an effective
form of emotional labor in educational settings (Ashforth & Humphrey,
2013; Taxer & Frenzel, 2015; Yin, 2016).
