Rhizomes are long-creeping and bear setose hairs. Leaves are large,
reaching up to 4.5 m in length, with laminae that
are 3- to 5-pinnate and possess free veins. The indument
consists of catenate, acicular, arachnoid, and/or minute gnarled hairs. Sori
are marginal, linear, and continuous along the laminar margins, borne
on commissural veins. The inner indusia are vestigial, while the
outer indusia are linear (Smith et al. 2006).
