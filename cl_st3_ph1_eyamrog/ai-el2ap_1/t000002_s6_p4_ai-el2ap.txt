Using this method, the study demonstrated how teachers and students
collaboratively construct scientific explanations through classroom discourse. Of the five
typologies identified in the original research, only one was examined
in this analysis. The findings indicate that teachers can guide
students' reasoning and facilitate the interactive development of explanations. Strategies
such as confrontation, response narrowing, and questioning were utilized to
support this process.
