The orchestra utilizes instruments traditionally associated with capoeira, although the
specific number and types of instruments employed may differ depending
on the occasion. The berimbau, an instrument of African origin,
is considered the most significant among them. Additional instruments commonly
used in capoeira include the atabaque (drum), pandeiro (tambourine), reco-reco
(a wooden serrated instrument played with a stick), and agog√¥
(cowbells). Participants who do not play an instrument contribute to
maintaining the rhythm by clapping their hands.
