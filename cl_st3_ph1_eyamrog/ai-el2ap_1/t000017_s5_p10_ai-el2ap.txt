The visual working memory subtest of the B-PREA-R was developed
with characteristics similar to those of the "Visual Memory Span"
subtest from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised. This subtest has consistently
functioned as an independent factor in multiple studies employing confirmatory
or exploratory factor analysis (Fernandez et al., 2019; Zapata et
al., 2019; Rosas et al., 2022; Marreros-Tananta & Guerrero-Alcedo, 2022).
