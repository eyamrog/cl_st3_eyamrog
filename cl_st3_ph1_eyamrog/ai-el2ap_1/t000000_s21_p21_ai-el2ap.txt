Plants terrestrial. Rhizomes erect to decumbent, ranging from stout to
trunk-like, and becoming glabrescent; leaves 1.2–2.2 m long; petioles 40–80
cm long, burgundy proximally and stramineous distally, with the proximal
portion wrinkled to minutely spiny; petiolar scales peltate, blackish, with
or without lighter, dentate margins; laminae 1-pinnate, 80–140 cm long;
rachises stramineous and glabrous; basal pinnae 15–25 × 2.5–3.5 cm;
costae glabrous on both abaxial and adaxial surfaces; veins typically
1-furcate, rarely simple or 2- to 3-furcate at the base
of the pinnae, glabrous on both surfaces; sori marginal, discrete,
borne at the tips of single veins, arranged side by
side, and opening extrorsely; outer indusia unmodified; inner indusia hemi-umbonate,
often forming wings that connect adjacent sori.
