Sandro stated that capoeira is accessible to everyone, allowing individuals
to select aspects that suit their preferences. He explained that
he previously identified as a fighter before becoming a capoeira
practitioner several years ago, attributing this transition to his history
of frequent involvement in physical altercations. He reported sustaining various
injuries in Brazil, including stab wounds, gunshot wounds, head injuries
from broken bottles, and abdominal lacerations during fights. He indicated
that these experiences influenced the development of his personal style
in capoeira. (Interview with Sandro â€“ audio transcription)
