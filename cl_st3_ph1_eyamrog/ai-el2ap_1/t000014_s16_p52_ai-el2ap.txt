The project participants comprised indigenous teachers and elders with expertise
in traditional culture. Some teachers were responsible for audio recording,
while others focused on transcription, translation, and metadata organization. One
Paresi participant contributed to video editing. A principal Paresi collaborator,
Jurandir Zezokiware, participated in the documentation project with the Enawene
Nawe (EN) community; his involvement was instrumental in establishing a
relationship of trust with the EN community. He provided assistance
during training sessions and contributed to the collection of linguistic
data. The project also included undergraduate students from UFPA, who
visited the Paresi and Enawene Nawe communities to gain practical
experience in fieldwork.
