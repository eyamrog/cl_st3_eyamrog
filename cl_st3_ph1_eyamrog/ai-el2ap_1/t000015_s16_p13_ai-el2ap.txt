A comparison of the JUOJS disciplinary distribution with that of
Scopus, which shares less than 4% overlap (see below), reveals
notable differences. Scopus contains a higher proportion of journals in
mathematics and medicine and health sciences, whereas JUOJS includes a
greater proportion of journals in education as well as language,
communication, and culture (Table 2). In other fields, such as
economics, engineering, and computer science, the disciplinary coverage is broadly
similar between JUOJS and Scopus. Further citation-based analyses could clarify
the extent to which journals in these two sets reference
each other within overlapping disciplinary domains.
