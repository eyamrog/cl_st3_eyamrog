A database comprising 1,720 scientific journals published in Latin America
and the Caribbean and indexed in SciELO and/or Redalyc was
constructed within the framework of OLIVA. The study was conducted
at two levels: the journal level and the document level.
The primary objective was to map this circuit of quality
scientific literature by examining existing forms of co-authorship, disciplinary characteristics,
and publication languages. The first section of this article provides
a detailed description of the journals included in the constructed
database (SciELO and Redalyc). Subsequently, the publishing institutions of these
journals are characterized, with particular attention to their predominantly public
status and the extent of self-management by the academic community.
An empirical classification of the journals’ disciplines was performed based
on information available on their respective websites, due to limitations
in the disciplinary cataloging provided by the indexing databases. This
classification indicated that the indexed production is broadly distributed, with
approximately half of the documents originating from the Social Sciences
and Humanities, and the other half from Engineering, Natural Sciences,
and Health and Biological Sciences. Patterns of co-authorship and various
levels of collaboration—global, regional (Latin America), and national—were then analyzed.
Additionally, language patterns within the corpus were examined, revealing an
increase in journals publishing in English and the emergence of
multilingualism in journals that have begun to publish in multiple
languages.
