It is important to acknowledge that, while information and communication
technologies (ICT) can facilitate the enhancement of contextualized TSA and
support engagement with a global discourse community, their benefits may
be limited in regions and countries where teachers and course
developers lack adequate access to such technologies. The scientific equity
that CEAP seeks to foster among students is influenced by
multiple factors beyond the control of instructors. Nevertheless, it remains
essential for ESP teachers and practitioners to continue seeking strategies
to increase access for underrepresented minorities through language courses. As
Bazerman et al. (2009, p. XIV) note, advancing communicative competence
for all and providing access to influential genres is fundamentally
an issue of social capacity and social justice.
