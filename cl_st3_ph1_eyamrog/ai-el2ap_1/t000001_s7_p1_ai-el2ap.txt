Compared to eukaryotes, which possess complex genomes often exceeding one
billion base pairs (bp) in length, prokaryotic genomes are relatively
small, typically consisting of a single circular chromosome of a
few million bp and often including small extrachromosomal plasmids. In
many genomic applications, it is desirable to obtain the complete
bacterial genome sequence, defined as the full nucleotide sequence of
each DNA molecule present in the cell. However, current DNA
sequencing technologies operate by fragmenting the genome and sequencing these
fragments, resulting in reads that are short, randomly ordered segments
of the genome. These reads are subject to errors, with
the frequency and type of errors varying by sequencing platform,
and are also redundant, as sequencing protocols require generating a
total read output that greatly exceeds the genome size to
achieve sufficient coverage. Consequently, there is a discrepancy between the
output of sequencing technologies, which provide short, imperfect, and redundant
sequences, and the objective of obtaining a complete, accurate genome
sequence.
