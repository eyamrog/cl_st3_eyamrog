m long; stipes 0.5–2.5 m long, brown at the base

laminae 0.5–2 m long, proximally 3-pinnate-pinnatifid to 4-pinnate; rachises light
brown, pilose, with brownish catenate hairs, lacking proliferous buds; basal
pinnae 25–100 cm × 12–35 cm, subequilateral; pinnules sessile, lanceolate
to oblong, with dentate margins; costae pilose on both abaxial
and adaxial surfaces, with light brown to reddish catenate hairs;
costules similarly pilose on both surfaces, with light brown to
reddish catenate hairs; veins free, hirsute on both surfaces, with
erect, light brown to reddish acicular hairs; laminar tissue between
veins on both surfaces with catenate and acicular hairs; sori
oblong or rounded, borne at the tips of single veins,
located in the sinuses of segments; indusia purse-shaped, typically bearing
