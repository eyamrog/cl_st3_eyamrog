In conclusion, the stems and leaves of the liana A.
crucigerum exhibited significantly increased stiffness after 48 hours of dehydration
following field sampling, compared to hydrated samples. Furthermore, the magnitude
of the dehydration effect was smaller in lianas than in
other growth forms, likely due to the distinctive anatomical structure
of lianas. Based on these findings, it is recommended that
biomechanical assessments of plant organs be conducted using samples that
are either kept consistently moist or tested immediately after field
collection to best represent natural conditions. These results contribute to
a more comprehensive understanding of the biomechanical properties of liana
stems and leaves and provide empirical support for current protocols
employed in plant biomechanics research.
