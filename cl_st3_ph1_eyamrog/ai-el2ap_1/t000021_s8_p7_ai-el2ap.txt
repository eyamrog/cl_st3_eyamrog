Despite the significant relevance of teachers' emotions to both teaching
and student learning (Akbari et al., 2016; Burić et al.,
2016; Taxer & Gross, 2018), this area has received limited
scholarly attention. Research on teachers' emotional experiences, particularly in Brazil,
has predominantly employed the theoretical framework of stress and coping,
with a primary focus on teachers' stress responses and the
stressful events they encounter (Burić et al., 2016; Lipp, 2016).
In contrast, the concept of emotion regulation includes a range
of both negative and positive emotions that arise during teachers'
routine professional activities, thereby offering broader opportunities for investigation in
this field.
