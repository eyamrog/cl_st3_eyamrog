Luriaâ€™s observation of several neurological patients enabled him to identify
a distinct scientific field that has developed further since the
late 1990s. Prior to this, neurological patients were primarily studied
through the lens of organic psychophysiology, focusing on brain reflexes
as the basis for explaining behavior. However, this approach did
not adequately address the role of these reflexes within the
context of human activity. Luria emphasized the significance of the
psychophysiology of activity, which examines not merely involuntary processes such
as unconditioned reflexes (e.g., breathing), but rather how individuals utilize
these physiological functions within purposeful activities such as sports, singing,
and swimming.
