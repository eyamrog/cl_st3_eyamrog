To address these limitations, the B-PREA was modified to enhance
its appeal, reduce its length, and facilitate its use by
educators in the preschool educational context. Specifically, the revisions were
guided by the methodological recommendations of early childhood education experts
in Cuba (Gallo et al., 2018), and the subtests of
the B-PREA were adapted to align with the requirements of
the preschool curriculum, enabling a comprehensive assessment of children based
on the educational and developmental dimensions outlined in the curriculum
improvement. Additionally, the modifications were informed by Resolution 238/2014, which
regulates the school evaluation system of the Cuban Ministry of
Education, to ensure the integration of the B-PREA subtests into
the preschool evaluation framework, either during the partial evaluation period
(four months after the start of the school year) or
the final evaluation period (at the end of the school
year).
