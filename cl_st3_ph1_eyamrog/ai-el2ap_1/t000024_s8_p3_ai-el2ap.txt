Genera within the Bromeliaceae family exhibit diverse life habits, including
epiphytic, rupicolous, saxicolous, terricolous, and facultative forms capable of inhabiting
both terrestrial and arboreal environments (Fischer & Ara√∫jo 1995). These
characteristics contribute to their recognition as a functionally significant group
within tropical forests (Barrancos et al. 2016). The capacity for
adaptation to varying environmental conditions is essential for survival following
translocation from their native habitats. During epiphytic relocation, bromeliad specimens
are typically attached to tree branches using cotton strings (Jasper
et al. 2005). However, over time, these specimens may become
inclined relative to the trunk axis, which can reduce survival
rates by impairing water storage within the central cistern, increasing
susceptibility to water stress, and potentially resulting in the plants
falling to the ground (Freitas et al. 1998). Consequently, direct
relocation to the ground in an upright position may enhance
rosette stability, particularly in larger bromeliads. A stabilized rosette structure
facilitates the accumulation of rainwater and nutrients between the leaves,
which can be absorbed by the plant or utilized by
associated fauna (Benzing 2000).
