This article examines three distinct aspects of football-related activities observed
during fieldwork conducted in June 2015, and introduces key social
actors involved in these activities. The first aspect concerns the
naming and branding of football clubs, with particular attention to
how linguistic and semiotic practices in these processes indexed various
Timorese identities. The second aspect addresses club leadership and the
organizational practices of club managers, focusing on how these individuals
utilized available language resources and knowledge in their management activities,
as well as the incorporation of Timorese cultural practices into
the ethos of certain clubs. The third aspect pertains to
the scheduling of football tournaments, particularly in relation to significant
dates in the history of Timor-Lesteâ€™s nationhood, and includes an
examination of friendly away matches and the use of social
media platforms such as Facebook and YouTube for the representation
and dissemination of information about both tournament and friendly matches.
