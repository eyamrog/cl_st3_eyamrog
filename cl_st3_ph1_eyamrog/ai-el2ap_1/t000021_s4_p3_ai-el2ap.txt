Future research could build on the findings of this study
to develop a context-specific scale for assessing teacher emotion regulation
and to investigate this phenomenon in larger and more diverse
samples using quantitative methodologies. Additionally, employing techniques such as behavioral
observation, diary studies, and other methods that capture the dynamic
nature of emotion regulation may provide a more comprehensive understanding
of teachers' contextual emotion regulation. Further investigation into the factors
motivating teachers to regulate their emotions, as well as the
implications of such regulation for their mental health, is also
warranted.
