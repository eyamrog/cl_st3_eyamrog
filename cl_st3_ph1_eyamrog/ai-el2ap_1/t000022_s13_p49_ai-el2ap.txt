The concentration of authors affiliated with institutions in the Southeastern
and Southern states does not preclude significant collaboration with colleagues
from other regions of the country. Furthermore, states such as
São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Rio de Janeiro are characterized
by a diverse range of institutions—including federal, state, and private
universities—among which inter-institutional collaboration in scholarly publications is likely to
occur. This diversity complicates the notion of academic inbreeding based
solely on authors’ affiliations within the same state, as collaborations
between researchers from institutions such as Unicamp (Universidade Estadual de
Campinas) and USP (Universidade de São Paulo), both located in
São Paulo, cannot be accurately described as merely provincial interactions.
