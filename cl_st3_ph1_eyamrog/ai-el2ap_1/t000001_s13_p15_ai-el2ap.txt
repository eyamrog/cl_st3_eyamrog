Due to its conservative approach, Polypolish may fail to correct
certain errors that other short-read polishers are able to address,
particularly in regions with low Illumina sequencing depth. However, alternative
polishers may introduce new errors, which is undesirable when the
objective is to achieve a highly accurate assembly. Therefore, it
is advisable to use additional short-read polishers, but to manually
evaluate all proposed changes using visualization tools such as IGV.
Examining read alignments at specific loci before and after polishing
can help determine whether a modification corrects an existing error
or introduces a new one, allowing for informed decisions regarding
the acceptance or rejection of each change. Recommended polishers for
this process include POLCA, due to its low rate of
introduced errors, and FMLRC2, due to its capacity to correct
errors that other polishers may not resolve.
