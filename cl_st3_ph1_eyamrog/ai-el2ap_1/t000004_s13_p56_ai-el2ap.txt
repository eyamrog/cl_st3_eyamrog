Pair practice typically follows individual movement exercises and serves as
an intermediate stage between solo practice and participation in the
actual game within the roda. Unlike the real game, pair
practice provides an opportunity for students to learn and refine
movements, allowing for discussion and feedback between partners. These exercises
are generally synchronized and performed at close range, making coordination
and communication essential for the effective execution of the sequences.
Students employ both spoken language and body movements to communicate,
a process that can be described as translanguaging. Verbal communication
tends to be more prominent when beginners are involved, whereas
advanced students, such as Tiago and his peers, often conduct
pair practice with minimal or no spoken interaction.
