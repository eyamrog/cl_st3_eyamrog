Respondents who reported experiencing early hostility also observed that attitudes
had shifted over time, particularly as additional migrant groups from
Poland, Portugal, and the Baltic States arrived (Interview with RS
and HA, June 2015). The establishment of a local nongovernmental
organization, the South Tyrone Empowerment Project (STEP), contributed to this
change by providing support to migrant-origin groups in areas such
as securing appropriate housing, navigating interactions with local authorities, addressing
legal matters, and offering interpretation and translation services in both
bureaucratic and healthcare contexts. During our field visits, we observed
some indications of a changing public ethos; for example, the
public library offered children's books in multiple languages, and Dungannon
Town Council organized a multicultural festival.
