Incentives for the implementation of the Digital Government project and
other ICT integrations in public services are included in recommendations

World Trade Organization (WTO), and the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD), particularly those related to economic interests. However,
these recommendations contrast with the level of financial support provided
to Brazil (Lib√¢neo, 2016a; Freitas, 2011; Evangelista, 2013).
