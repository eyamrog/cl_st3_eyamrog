Germination variables, including germination percentage (G%), mean germination time (MGT),
and speed index, were analyzed using permutation-based analysis of variance
(10,000 iterations) implemented with the lmPerm package (Wheeler & Torchiano
2016) in R statistical software (R Core Team 2020). The
statistical models assessed the effects of water immersion treatments (control,
soaking in water for 24, 48, and 72 hours, and
hot water for 5 and 10 minutes), storage period (freshly
harvested versus stored pyrenes), and their interaction on the germination
variables (see Supplementary Material Table S1). Post hoc comparisons among
all treatment combinations were conducted using Tukeyâ€™s Honestly Significant Difference
(HSD) test to control for multiple testing.
