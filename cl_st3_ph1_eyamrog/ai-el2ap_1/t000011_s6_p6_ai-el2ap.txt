The results presented here may have significant implications for studies
on the evolution and dietary ecology of non-human primates. The
physical properties of plants consumed or utilized by non-human primates
can act as selective pressures influencing both morphological and behavioral
adaptations (Lucas et al. 2012; Youlatos 1999). Lianas are key
structural components of forest ecosystems, characterized by resistant and flexible
stems that remain suspended and connect tree canopies, thereby facilitating
locomotion for various animal species (Rowe 2018; Lambert & Halsey
2014; Yanoviak 2015; Arroyo-Rodr√≠guez et al. 2015). The presence of
lianas may influence the evolution and daily life of non-human
primates, as suggested by Youlatos (1999), who proposed that the
locomotor anatomy of the pygmy marmoset may be an adaptation
to feeding and moving within liana-dominated forests. Furthermore, many primate
species rely on lianas as important food resources, which can
constitute a substantial portion of their diet, particularly during periods
when other foods are scarce (Marshall & Wrangham 2007). The
relatively low toughness of liana leaves may therefore be a
significant factor in their consumption by non-human primates. Consequently, understanding
the physical properties of liana structures can contribute valuable insights
into the evolutionary influences on the feeding and locomotor morphology
of non-human primates (Youlatos 1999; Lucas et al. 2012).
