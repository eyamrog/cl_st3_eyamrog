Previous studies have indicated that this palm species may exhibit
seed dormancy, and that water immersion treatments can enhance germination
(Fava & Alburqueque 2011; Masetto et al. 2012). However, information
regarding its seed storage behavior remains limited (but see Masetto
et al. 2012). Several species, including palm species that dominate
wetland ecosystems, may display fruit and seed dispersal as well
as germination strategies that are influenced by water pulses (Orozco-Segovia
et al. 2003; Fabri 2018; Pires et al. 2018; Bao
et al. 2018; Oliveira et al. 2019; Elias & Viera
2020). The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of
water immersion pretreatments (~25°C and 75°C) and one year of
storage on the seed germination of C. alba, addressing the
following research questions: (i) do these seeds exhibit dormancy; (ii)
what is the effect of water pretreatments on the germination
of caranday pyrenes; (iii) how can the germination behavior be
classified after one year of storage; and (iv) do water
immersion pretreatments enhance or reduce the germination of stored seeds?
Given that the thick endocarp may impede germination, water immersion
treatments were expected to improve germination rates, although it was
anticipated that seed viability could decrease following a prolonged storage
period.
