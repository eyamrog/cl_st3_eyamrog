In response to these requirements, several authors have developed and
validated instruments for assessing preschool children in low- and middle-income
Latin American countries (Bornstein et al., 2015). In Argentina, the
Childhood Executive Functioning Inventory (CHEXI) was developed (Gutiérrez et al.,
2021); in Chile, the Test de Evaluación Neuropsicológica Infantil (TENI)
was introduced (Tenorio et al., 2014); and in Mexico, both
the Evaluación Neuropsicológica Infantil (ENI) (Matute et al., 2007) and
the Batería de Funciones Ejecutivas y Lóbulos Frontales (BANFE) (Flores
et al., 2012) were created. In Cuba, Ramírez et al.
(2013) utilized the Luria Inicial neuropsychological battery to assess preschool
children's development. Although this instrument demonstrated adequate validity and reliability,
its application in educational settings is limited due to its
lengthy and complex administration procedures, as well as the significant
time and training required for educators to implement it in
classroom environments.
