Spoken language may be replaced by the demonstration of movement
alone. For example, on one occasion, Sandro gathers his students
on one side of the room and silently performs a
movement toward the opposite side, with the students following him.
In this context, verbal explanation is unnecessary, as the activity
is already familiar to the students.
