This article presents the findings of the Latin American Observatory
of Evaluation Indicators (OLIVA, for its Spanish acronym), which aims
to increase the visibility of scientific output indexed in Latin
America and the Caribbean and to enhance its utility for
research assessment. The study analyzes open access publications from journals
indexed in SciELO and Redalyc, utilizing a deduplicated dataset comprising
908,982 documents and 2,591,704 authors. It quantifies the scale of
this scholarly production, describes its disciplinary diversity, and examines patterns
of national, regional, and international research collaboration. The analysis also
considers the publishers of the 1,720 journals included in the
database, representing 15 countries, and identifies a predominance of universities
and public institutions within this regional publishing landscape. The study
further investigates journals employing the article processing charge (APC) model,
finding that this model has a substantially lower prevalence in
the region compared to other continents, with Brazil exhibiting the
highest incidence of APC use. Additionally, an analysis of inter-state
collaboration within Brazil, based on SciELO data, reveals significant levels
of cooperation, challenging the conventional view that co-authorship among researchers
from the same country necessarily indicates academic inbreeding. The study
concludes that these journals demonstrate multi-scalar circulation, linguistic diversity, and
disciplinary breadth, which collectively address the current requirements of scholarly
communication in the context of open science.
