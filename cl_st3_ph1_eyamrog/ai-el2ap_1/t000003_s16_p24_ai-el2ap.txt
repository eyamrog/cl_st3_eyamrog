The Young Crocs team was established for Timorese boys aged
14 to 19 who were residing in Northern Ireland and
spoke Irish English. The team’s name reflected their engagement with
the English language, while the reference to crocodiles signaled their
Timorese identity, as the crocodile is a significant cultural symbol
in Timor-Leste due to the island’s perceived resemblance to this
animal. The name FC Tahi Calu carried multiple associations, including
those related to gender. Literally translated as "male sea," the
name refers geographically to the southeast region of Timor-Leste, an
area characterized by stronger tides. Additionally, in Fataluku (as in
Tetum), the term "male sea" connotes roughness and is contrasted
with "female sea," which denotes calmness, thereby imparting a masculine
connotation to the team’s name.
