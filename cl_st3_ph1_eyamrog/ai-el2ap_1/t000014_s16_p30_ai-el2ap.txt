A second issue that emerged was the question of access
for community members, specifically the distinction between individuals who possess
computer and Internet literacy and those who do not. The
general consensus was that individuals with the necessary skills could
access the archived materials online, whereas those without such skills
would require physical copies in formats such as DVDs or
CDs. A third issue pertained to the content of the
recordings; one community member expressed concern about recordings containing crude
jokes or profanity and the potential audience for these materials.
The concern was not about international listeners, but rather about
the reactions of Mako individuals from neighboring villages who might
not recognize the humorous intent of such content. Additionally, there
was discussion regarding videos of traditional activities, which were generally
perceived as non-problematic, especially when contrasted with violent films known
to the community. This context allowed for clarification that individual
speakers retain the ability to restrict access to their recordings
both at the time of creation and in the future,
with specific access provisions being adjustable as needed. Overall, this
discussion indicated to Ros√©s Labrada that, compared to the initial
meeting in July 2012, community members in Arena Blanca had
developed a more comprehensive understanding of ethical considerations related to
informed consent, archiving, and access.
