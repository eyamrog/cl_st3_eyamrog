Although the roda is characterized by a culturally specific lexicon,
it primarily functions as a space for non-verbal bodily interaction,
with communication occurring largely through physical gestures. These include actions
such as the initial invitation to participate and the concluding
gestures of submission, all of which are culturally significant and
must be learned by capoeiristas. In this context, Sophie’s use
of both verbal and gestural apology to Mestre João is
atypical. Additionally, a fundamental aspect of the roda and capoeira
practice more broadly is the integration of bodily movement with
music, as the music establishes the rhythm and tempo that
guide the participants’ physical interactions.
