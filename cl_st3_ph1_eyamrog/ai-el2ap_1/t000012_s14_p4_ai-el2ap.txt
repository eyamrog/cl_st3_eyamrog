We analyzed the degree centrality of the Brazilian and African
networks described by Sazima et al. (2012) and Mikula et
al. (2017) by quantifying the number of host species with
which each cleaner bird species interacted. Degree centrality was measured
as the number of unique host species per cleaner species,
with higher values indicating more central nodes within the network.
We then compared the degree centrality of each bird species
to its corresponding H value using regression analysis. Our hypothesis
was that bird species interacting with a greater diversity of
host species (i.e., possessing more links to different mammal species)
would exhibit higher H values, indicating a positive correlation between
these two variables (see Fig. 2). Detailed information on host
species and H values for each bird species is provided
in Supplementary Fig. 2.
