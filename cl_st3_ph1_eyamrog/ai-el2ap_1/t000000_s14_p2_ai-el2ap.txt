Since 2012, we have conducted sampling of the remnant forest
patches. Specimens were collected and dried following standard protocols for
fern collections (Windisch 1992) and subsequently incorporated into the VIC
herbarium (herbarium acronyms follow Thiers, continuously updated), with duplicates designated
for distribution to other herbaria. In addition, we conducted a
comprehensive review of the collections at the VIC herbarium and
examined online records from other herbaria, including F, IAN, NY,
PH, RB, U, UC, UPCB, US, and WTU. While previous
fascicles utilized a classification system adapted from Kenrick & Crane
(1997) and Smith et al. (2006), the present study adopts
the PPG I (2016) system. Morphological terminology follows Lellinger (2002).
