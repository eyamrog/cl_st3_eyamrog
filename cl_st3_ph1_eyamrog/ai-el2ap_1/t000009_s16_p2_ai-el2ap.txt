In 2014, Vieira conducted a comprehensive needs analysis to examine
the purposes for which Brazilian computer science graduates require English
in academic contexts. The findings indicated that the primary immediate
need for these students is to write research articles and
abstracts. Building on these results, a subsequent target situation analysis
(TSA) was conducted with a focus on both genres. In
addition to a textual analysis, which will be reported in
future work, a contextual analysis was carried out to investigate
key factors that influence the use of these genres within
the academic community. Specifically, the contextual TSA presented in this
study aimed to identify factors that may affect the acceptance
of papers authored by Brazilian computer scientists in high-impact journals.
