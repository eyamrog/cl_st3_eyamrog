Capoeira songs constitute a significant domain for the use of
the Portuguese language within the practice of capoeira. While the
majority of these songs are in Portuguese, it is important
to note, as Sandro highlights, that a small but noteworthy
proportion are either in other languages, such as Yoruba, or
incorporate lexical elements from various languages. Students are required to
sing these songs during class, necessitating their memorization and active
reproduction. Additionally, the songs contain numerous references to the history
and culture of both capoeira and Brazil, which, as previously
discussed, Sandro typically explains in English.
