Vuotto, Di CÃ©sare, and Pallotta (2020) analyzed 17 bibliographic databases
and found that only a limited number currently provide their
records in a standardized format and structure suitable for document-level
production analysis. Consequently, existing empirical studies have been restricted to
analyzing journal collections as they are individually presented by each
indexing database. Scopus includes 890 journals published in the region,
while Web of Science indexes 223. As of June 2021,
SciELO listed 1,358 active, indexed journals, which are also available
through the SciELO Citation Index on the Web of Science
platform, thereby facilitating the assessment of article performance in a
global citation context. Redalyc maintains its own information system and
indicators for its collection of 1,415 journals. There is significant
overlap between the journal collections of SciELO and Redalyc. Additionally,
Biblat operates its own cataloging system and provides a substantial
number of complete document-level records. However, it is currently not
feasible to integrate data from these three regional indexing databases
due to a lack of interoperability. LA Referencia should also
be considered; it is a significant database that aggregates outputs
from 790 institutions across 12 Ibero-American countries and currently contains
over three million documents. Nevertheless, it lacks advanced journal-level search
functionality and exhibits data overlap with the aforementioned indexing services,
as its content is sourced from individual institutional repositories.
