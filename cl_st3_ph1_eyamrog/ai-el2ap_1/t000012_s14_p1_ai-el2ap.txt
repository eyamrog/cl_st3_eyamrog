To investigate the influence of avian diet diversity on cleaning
associations, where birds (cleaners) feed on the parasites or injured
tissue of mammals (clients), we first calculated a diet diversity
index (H) for all bird species using data from the
EltonTraits 1.0 database, which provides species-level foraging attributes for birds
and mammals (Wilman et al. 2014). In this database, each
bird species’ diet is classified into broad categories (see Supplementary
Figure 1a). We used these categories to estimate the diet
diversity of each species by calculating Shannon’s Diversity Index (Shannon
1948): <>, where Hj represents the diet diversity of species
j, R is the number of diet categories, and pi
is the proportion of diet category i in the diet
of species j. Higher H values indicate greater dietary diversity
within a species. Based on the two previously defined predictions
(Figure 1), the methods are organized into two sections: (a)
comparison of H values between cleaner bird species from Brazilian
and African cleaning networks (Sazima et al. 2012; Mikula et
al. 2017) and their non-cleaning close relatives, and (b) assessment
of the correlation between H values and the degree centrality
of species within both networks. An overview of the methodological
approach is provided in Figure 2.
