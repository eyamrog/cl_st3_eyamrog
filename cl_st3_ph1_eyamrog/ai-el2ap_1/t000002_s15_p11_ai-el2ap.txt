The term 'dialogic' is used to characterize utterances in which
participants contribute meaningfully to the progression of ideas by critically
considering and incorporating the perspectives of others in the collective
construction of knowledge (Kershner, Dowdall, et al., 2020; Mercer, 2003).
In line with the research objectives, engagement in dialogic talk
was operationalized as the relatively frequent occurrence of three specific
dialogic codes.
