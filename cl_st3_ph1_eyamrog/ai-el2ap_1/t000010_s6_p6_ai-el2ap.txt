These results may be explained by differences in the level
of educational stimulation experienced by both groups. High levels of
stimulation could account for the observed similarities, as many preschool
activities involve tasks that require children to compare objects based
on similarities and differences, as well as motor activities that
necessitate the use of either the right or left hand
according to individual manual preference. Conversely, the findings may also
reflect low levels of stimulation or a generally slow developmental
trajectory in these neuropsychological variables. Previous Cuban studies have identified
similarity-difference discrimination and right-left orientation as skills that develop slowly
in preschool children relative to their chronological age (Ramirez et
al., 2015).
