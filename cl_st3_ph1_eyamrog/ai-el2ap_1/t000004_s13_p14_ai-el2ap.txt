As previously discussed, capoeira has expanded from its origins in
Bahia to other regions of Brazil and internationally. Delamont and
Stephens (2008) examine the interplay between global and local dimensions
in diasporic capoeira, conceptualizing it as an "embodied habitus." Situating
their analysis within the broader discourse on globalization and diaspora,
the authors present two key arguments that are particularly relevant
to the present study.
