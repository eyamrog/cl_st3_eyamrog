A total of 70 publications were selected from 796 records
retrieved from the databases. The included studies primarily consisted of
non-systematic reviews and case studies, with only six clinical trials
identified. Narrative synthesis revealed twenty distinct therapies, with the most
frequently reported interventions being wound dressings (58.6%), analgesic drugs (55.7%),
topical antimicrobials (25.7%), skin barriers (15.7%), cryotherapy (5.7%), and negative
pressure wound therapy (4.3%). These therapies were recommended for application
either to the wound bed or the periwound skin. Notably,
68.5% of the studies did not describe the use of
a standardized pain assessment.
