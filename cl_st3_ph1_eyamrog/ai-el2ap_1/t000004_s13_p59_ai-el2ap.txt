The roda typically occupied only the final 15 minutes of
Sandroâ€™s class and was sometimes omitted due to time constraints
or insufficient participant numbers. However, it was a prominent component
of the workshops, where it consistently occurred at the conclusion
of each session. The roda serves as an opportunity for
participants to engage in a spontaneous game of capoeira, focusing
on the practical application of their skills rather than formal
instruction. It also allows for personal expression and enjoyment through
activities such as singing, playing instruments, and participating in capoeira
games.
