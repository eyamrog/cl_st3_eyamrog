The revised B-PREA (B-PREA-R) for educators is necessary in the
Cuban educational context for several practical and theoretical reasons: (1)
there is a lack of validation studies in Cuba for
educational assessments targeting children aged three to six years; (2)
most existing Cuban tests are complex and time-consuming, making them
unsuitable for use by educators in preschool settings; and (3)
there has been an increase in the number of preschool
children with developmental limitations in several provinces of Cuba (Ramírez
& Bernal, 2020; Íñiguez et al., 2017).
