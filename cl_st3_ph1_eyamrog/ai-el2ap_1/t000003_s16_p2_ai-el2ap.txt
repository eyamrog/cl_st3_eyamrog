Since independence in 2002, a new pattern of transnational migration
has emerged, with a substantial number of young Timorese men
and women seeking employment opportunities in Indonesia, South Korea, Australia,
and Western Europe. Following independence, Portugal allowed all individuals born
in Timor-Leste before May 20, 2002, to apply for Portuguese
citizenship, thereby granting them the right to reside and work
in Portugal and other European Union (EU) member states. This
policy was based on the fact that, under international law,
the eastern region of the island of Timor was considered
a Portuguese colony until 2002, as neither Portugal nor the
United Nations recognized the Indonesian occupation and administration of the
territory from 1975 to 2002. This political and legal framework
contributed to reducing high levels of youth unemployment in urban
areas of Timor-Leste in the years immediately following independence.
