For example, Extract 1 presents an instance of dialogic talk
that emerged within these groups; this episode was specifically selected
to demonstrate how students engaged in high levels of dialogicity.
The identification of this episode among others was achieved through
systematic coding and frequency analysis of the entire dataset. Quantitative
analysis indicated that more than half of the utterances in
this episode were classified as dialogic (17 out of 30,
approximately 57%). For comparison, the average proportion of dialogic utterances
across the seven tasks was approximately 33% (see Figure 3).
