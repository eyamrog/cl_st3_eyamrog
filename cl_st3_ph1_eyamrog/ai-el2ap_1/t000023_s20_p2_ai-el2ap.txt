Cells are 1.1–1.2 times longer than broad, occasionally approximately 1.1
times broader than long. The median constriction is deep, with
a linear sinus that is slightly open at the extremity.
Semicells are trapezoidal with a truncate apex, rounded angles, and
lateral margins that are convex to slightly straight. The cell
wall is smooth. Each cell contains a single chloroplast, with
one pyrenoid per semicell. In apical view, the cell appears
elliptical, while in lateral view, each semicell appears circular. Cell
dimensions are as follows: length 6.8–14.1 µm, width 6.3–11.3 µm,
and isthmus 1–4.3 µm.
