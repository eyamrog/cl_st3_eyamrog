The questions were organized into an array format (Figure 2),
adapted from Gordon and Dawes (2015), and implemented using Microsoft
Word, which was populated with participants’ responses. During the interviews,
participants were given access to the array via Skype’s screen
sharing feature, allowing them to actively engage in the data
collection process by monitoring and, if necessary, correcting the researcher’s
interpretation of their responses. This method employs a second-person perspective,
in which the researcher functions as a mediator to facilitate
participants’ articulation of their subjective experiences through targeted questioning (Keranen
et al., 2012). Furthermore, this approach promotes greater engagement from
both the researcher and participants, as both parties share responsibility
for the accuracy and completeness of the collected data.
