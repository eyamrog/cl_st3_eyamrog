The contramestre, the jogadores, the songs and sayings, the specific
terminology used to describe various elements of the capoeira assemblage—derived
from Afro-Brazilian Portuguese—as well as the roda, the berimbau, and
other instruments, collectively contribute to a performance that reflects significant
cultural heritage. These components are integrated within an assemblage that
simultaneously embodies both repetition and innovation, as evidenced by the
structured improvisations characteristic of capoeira practice.
