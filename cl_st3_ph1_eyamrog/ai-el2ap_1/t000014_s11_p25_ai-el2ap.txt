In summary, the selection of an appropriate repository is a
critical consideration for the long-term preservation and accessibility of language
documentation materials. Archives with robust infrastructure, such as those affiliated
with the DELAMAN consortium, often serve an international user base
and should not be regarded as proprietary to the country
in which they are physically located. Archiving efforts at local,
regional, national, and international levels each provide distinct benefits. In
certain circumstances, depositing materials in multiple repositories may be advisable
to address local needs while also utilizing broader infrastructure that
ensures optimal preservation and access (see ยง3.2 and ยง6 below).
