Both the instrumental and deterministic perspectives conceptualize technology as neutral,
thereby overlooking its inherent cultural and social values and attributing
outcomes solely to individual human actions. The instrumental perspective regards
technology exclusively as a tool, whereas the deterministic perspective frames
technology as a solution to various social problems whose origins
are external to technological development.
