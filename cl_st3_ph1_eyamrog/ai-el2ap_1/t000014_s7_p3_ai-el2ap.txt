This article begins by outlining the fundamental aspects of archiving
in language documentation initiatives, including the rationale for archiving, its
benefits, and practical approaches to implementation (§2). To promote the
quality, longevity, and accessibility of language resources, the discussion addresses
current best practices in digital curation, contrasts established language archives
with other online platforms, examines the advantages of archiving, and
considers key decisions regarding the selection and timing of materials
to be archived. The article also examines the process of
selecting appropriate archives, with particular attention to the availability, structure,
and maintenance of archives relevant to Brazilian indigenous languages and
related documentation projects; the archive of the Museu Paraense Emílio
Goeldi serves as a case study in this context (§3).
Subsequent sections address the relationship between archives and communities, emphasizing
the ethical considerations of informed consent and community access to
documentation, illustrated by a case study from Jorge Emilio Rosés
Labrada’s work with Mako speakers in Venezuela (§4). The importance
of archiving legacy materials—those produced prior to the digital era
and often preserved on fragile, short-lived media—is discussed in §5.
Section 6 returns to the Brazilian context, presenting a detailed
case study of documentation and archiving projects involving the Paresi-Haliti
and Enewane Nawe languages, conducted by Ana Paula Brandão, which
exemplifies many of the issues previously discussed. The article concludes
with final observations in §7.
