Needs analysis is the process by which ESP practitioners systematically
examine the specific linguistic and communicative requirements of both the
target and present situations (Songhori, 2008). This process operationalizes the
principle of praxis, which is recognized as a central tenet
of the ESP approach. Kumaravadivelu (2001) refers to this principle
as practicality, emphasizing that, through the analysis of discourse features
relevant to the instructional context and the classroom environment, teachers
adopt a scientific approach in which their theoretical understanding informs
their pedagogical decisions. Since the foundational work of Swales (1990)
in ESP, these principles have consistently guided ESP practice in
both occupational (EOP – English for Occupational Purposes) and academic
(EAP – English for Academic Purposes) contexts.
