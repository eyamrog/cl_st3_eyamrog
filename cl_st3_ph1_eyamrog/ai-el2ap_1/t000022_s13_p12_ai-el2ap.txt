The distribution of publishing institutions based on their editorial management
and financing models reveals five main types of publishers represented
in SciELO and Redalyc journals: (1) universities; (2) scientific societies,
professional associations, independent research centers, national academies, and professional councils;
(3) governmental agencies, including ministry departments, museums, and publicly managed
hospitals; (4) commercial publishers, which in this context refers to
small and medium-sized national and local specialized publishers; and (5)
large commercial publishers. The last category includes Reed-Elsevier, Wiley-Blackwell, Springer,
and Taylor & Francis, which are classified as oligopolistic commercial
publishers due to their concentration of between 50% and 70%
of the world’s scientific output up to 2013 (Larivière, Haustein,
and Mongeon, 2015).
