Only a single specimen of this species was recorded in
the present study. Compared to the population described by Silva
and Cecy (2004), the current specimen is notably longer and
exhibits less pronounced marginal undulations. In contrast, it is smaller
than the material reported by Felisberto and Rodrigues (2010), and
displays fewer lateral margin undulations than those described by Menezes
et al. (2011). Although Cosmarium impressulum may be confused with
Cosmarium undulatum Corda ex Ralfs, Bicudo et al. (2019) indicate
that these species can be distinguished by the number of
marginal undulations—C. undulatum possesses 10–12 undulations, while C. impressulum has
up to 6—and by cell size, with C. undulatum being
comparatively larger (44–64 × 30–52 µm).
