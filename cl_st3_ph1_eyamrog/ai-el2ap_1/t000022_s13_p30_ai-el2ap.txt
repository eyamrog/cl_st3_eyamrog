Excluding journals published in Brazil, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Chile,
an average of 5.4% of articles are published in English.
In contrast, the use of Portuguese as a publication language
outside Brazilian journals is minimal, with Portuguese comprising 5.4% of
articles in Costa Rican journals, 3.8% in Uruguayan journals, and
2.5% in Ecuadorian journals. In Spanish-speaking countries, Spanish remains the
dominant language of publication; in journals from Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador,
Peru, the Dominican Republic, Uruguay, and Venezuela, more than 90%
of articles are published in Spanish.
