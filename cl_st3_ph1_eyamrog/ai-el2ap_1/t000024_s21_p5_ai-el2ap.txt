Furthermore, in W. cyathiformis (Table 4), the number of leaves
in bromeliads transplanted as either terricolous or epiphytic did not
differ significantly (p > 0.05) across the observed periods, indicating
that leaf number is not influenced by the mode of
transplantation, consistent with findings for A. distichantha. However, the number
of leaves in W. cyathiformis decreased significantly (p < 0.05)
from 252 days onward and remained stable for the remainder
of the experiment. This pattern suggests that the bromeliads may
have experienced abiotic stress related to water and nutrient availability
following transplantation.
