From a theoretical perspective, Filho (2013) presents a comprehensive discussion
on the incommensurability, complementarity, and unity of research paradigms. Proponents
of the first thesis maintain that the realist and interpretivist
paradigms are fundamentally opposed and therefore incompatible. Advocates of the
complementarity perspective argue that both paradigms are legitimate and not
necessarily in conflict, as each addresses research objectives that may
not be achievable by the other. Finally, the notion of
unity between these paradigms is primarily supported by post-positivist and
critical philosophers, who contend that there is no logical or
consistent basis for dividing knowledge into strictly separate categories.
