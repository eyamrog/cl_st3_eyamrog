Rhizomes are short to long-creeping, protostelic with internal phloem, or
rarely solenostelic, and bear basally attached, nonclathrate scales or hairs.
Leaves are monomorphic, with laminae ranging from simple to 3-pinnate,
and rarely more dissected. Veins are usually free, but may
occasionally anastomose, in which case included veinlets are absent. Indument
is generally absent or consists of 2-celled glandular hairs. Sori
are marginal or submarginal, extrorse, and elongate to linear, and
are protected by both outer (not modified) and inner (modified)
indusia. Spores are typically tetrahedral and trilete, but may rarely
be bilateral and monolete (Smith et al. 2006).
