Several well-structured linguistic documentation projects, led by Brazilian linguists, are
currently underway and are generating substantial amounts of recorded data,
thereby increasing the demand for professional archiving solutions. For instance,
the Documentation Center at the Federal University of Amap√° in
Oiapoque is conducting documentation projects with the Karipuna and Galibi-Marworno
communities (coordinated by Gelsama Mara Ferreira do Santos) and with
the Palikur community (coordinated by Elissandra Barros da Silva). At
present, data from these projects are stored on microcomputers and
external hard drives. The Galibi-Marworno project has accumulated 13.5 GB
of audio files (.wav), 403 GB of video files (.mov,
.mp4), 51 GB of photographs, and 15 GB of edited
video. The Palikur project has collected 20 GB of audio,
6 TB of video (.mp4), and over 100,000 photographs in
RAW format, amounting to a total of 10 TB.
