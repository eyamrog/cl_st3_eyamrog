Experimental setup in the field â€“ Sixty individual plants were
marked with white plastic tags, which were attached to the
youngest and most physiologically active adult leaves using a plastic
string inserted through a punched hole. After tagging, the plants
were transported to the experimental site in the forest. Random
selection of individuals for placement in different experimental conditions (on
pitchforks, trunks, or on the ground) was achieved by drawing
previously numbered pieces of paper corresponding to each plant. This
procedure ensured random assignment of bromeliads to the various experimental
treatments.
