The majority of rental accommodation in Dungannon and Cookstown consists
of houses, with relatively few apartments available. Due to the
high cost of renting an entire house, multiple occupancy is
common among single migrants. Additionally, some married individuals from Timor-Leste
also share housing with family members or friends from their
country of origin.
