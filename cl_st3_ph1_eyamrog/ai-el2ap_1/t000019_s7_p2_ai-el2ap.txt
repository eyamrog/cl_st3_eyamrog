Contemporary society is characterized by a high degree of digitization
across services, production, and products. According to Castells (2000), this
"Society of Networks" presents significant challenges for individuals who lack
knowledge of or the ability to engage with digital culture,
as such deficiencies can hinder active participation and access to
the opportunities it provides.
