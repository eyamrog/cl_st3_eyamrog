Journals edited in Brazil constitute 29.4% of the total and
are responsible for 48.9% of all documents and 50.1% of
the articles analyzed. This predominance of Brazilian output is further
evident in the number of contributing authors, which reflects a
growing trend in Brazil toward collaborative research involving three or
more researchers, including within the social sciences and humanities. In
terms of article count, journals from Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Cuba,
and Argentina follow those from Brazil. Journals from the remaining
countries in the region account for only 8.7% of the
articles.
