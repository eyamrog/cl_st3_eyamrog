An important characteristic of scholarly communication in Latin America is
the extensive implementation of Open Access, which has been facilitated
by the commitment of research funding agencies, universities, scientific societies,
and publishers to establish not-for-profit infrastructures that enhance the visibility
of scientific information globally. The entire OLIVA corpus is accessible
in open access and full text through the SciELO Network
and Redalyc platform websites, as well as on the individual
journal websites and in thematic and institutional repositories. Beyond the
1,720 journals analyzed in this study, there are thousands of
additional journals in the region with a demonstrated history of
sustained operation, which have played a significant role in the
expansion of open access in Latin America.
