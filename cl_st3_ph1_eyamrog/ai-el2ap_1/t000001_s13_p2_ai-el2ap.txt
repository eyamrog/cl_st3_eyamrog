If culturing and DNA extraction are performed multiple times, such
as separately for Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and Illumina sequencing,
there is a risk of introducing genomic differences between the
resulting DNA samples. These discrepancies can complicate downstream processes such
as genome polishing. Therefore, it is advisable to use a
single DNA extract for all sequencing runs to ensure consistency.
Additionally, storing extra DNA or bacterial pellets by freezing may
be beneficial in case further sequencing becomes necessary.
