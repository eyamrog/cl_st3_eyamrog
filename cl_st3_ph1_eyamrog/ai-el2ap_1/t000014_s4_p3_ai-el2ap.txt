The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the urgency of efforts to
document and preserve endangered languages. The loss of elder community
members has resulted in a reduction of fluent speakers, further
endangering linguistic diversity. Documentary archives play a critical role in
preserving linguistic and cultural knowledge, ensuring its accessibility for future
generations, community members, researchers, and other stakeholders. These archives facilitate
research by providing alternative sources of data and analysis, particularly
when fieldwork is not feasible. Additionally, archives serve as valuable
resources for communities seeking to revitalize, maintain, or document their
linguistic and cultural heritage.
