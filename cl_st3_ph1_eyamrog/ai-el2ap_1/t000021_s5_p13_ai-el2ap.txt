Social sharing refers to the exchange of experiences and emotions
with colleagues, superiors, teaching staff, friends, and family members (Burić
et al., 2016; Sutton, 2004). Teachers who perceive social support
emphasize the importance of this strategy in broadening their regulatory
strategies and mitigating negative emotions. The process of sharing emotions
has been shown to alleviate stress, enhance resilience, support effective
teaching practices, and improve overall well-being (Clarà, 2017).
