Regarding W. cyathiformis (Table 6), no significant differences were observed
in the number of sprouts between terricolous and epiphytic relocation
forms during each observation period (p > 0.05), indicating that
the method of relocation did not affect sprout production throughout
the experiment. Sprout production remained statistically constant over time in
both terricolous and epiphytic forms (p > 0.05), suggesting that
the emission of sprouts is stable regardless of relocation type.
The consistent production of new sprouts may be attributed to
abiotic stress associated with adaptation to new fixation environments, either
on phorophytes or on the forest floor. Jasper et al.
(2005) reported that new roots originating from shoots may facilitate
attachment to the phorophyte, with root development occurring slowly, typically
within six to twelve months after transplantation. In the present
study, root system development was not assessed to avoid potential
physical damage to young roots that could result from removing
specimens from their relocation sites. The significance of root development
for epiphyte attachment has been highlighted by Jasper et al.
(2005), who observed high mortality rates in Vriesea friburgensis Mez
due to inadequate attachment to the phorophyte. Similarly, Barrancos (2016)
demonstrated that the presence of new roots anchoring the trunk
contributes to the survival of relocated specimens.
