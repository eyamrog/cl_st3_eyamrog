With the transformation of productive processes in contemporary society, numerous
professional activities and citizen services have transitioned to digital formats,
necessitating at least a basic level of information technology proficiency.
In the Brazilian federal public sector, data from the Digital
Government Secretariat of the Ministry of the Economy indicate that,
prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 54% of public services offered
to the population had already been digitized. By the end
of 2020, more than 60% of federal government services were
available in digital form, with the stated objective of achieving
full digitization (100%) by the end of 2022 (Brasil, 2020).
