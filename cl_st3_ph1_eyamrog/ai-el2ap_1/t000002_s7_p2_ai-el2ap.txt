Flanders (1970) conducted one of the earliest large-scale studies on
classroom dialogue, identifying the "two-thirds rule," which states that in
typical classrooms, two-thirds of the time is occupied by talk;
of this, two-thirds is teacher talk, and two-thirds of teacher
talk consists of lecturing. Another significant finding concerns the triadic
discourse structure—initiation, response, and feedback or evaluation—as described by Mehan
(1979) and Sinclair and Coulthard (1975). This pattern is considered
the most prevalent feature of whole-class discussions and has been
found to account for up to 70% of teacher-student interactions
(Cazden, 1988; Nassaji & Wells, 2000; Wells, 1993). Although the
majority of these studies have been conducted in Anglo-Saxon contexts,
the triadic discourse pattern has been recognized internationally (Alexander, 2001).
