The emergence of a global consensus regarding the necessity of
open access to scientific literature has increased the focus on
journals and indexing systems within the region. Basson et al.
(2021) examined the proportion of open access articles available in
Dimensions, reporting that by 2021, 46.6% of its documents were
open access. This proportion rose to 63.5% for documents published
by journals from Latin America and the Caribbean. There is
a limited number of studies that provide document-level information on
the scope and diversity of scientific output in the region,
aside from analyses based on mainstream databases. A notable precedent
is the study by Miguel (2011), which compared the coverage
of journals from Latin America and the Caribbean included in
SciELO, Redalyc, and SCOPUS for the period 2005â€“2009. The estimated
volume of scientific production derived from these three sources indicated
differences in coverage compared to the Latindex catalog. Regarding disciplinary
coverage, SCOPUS and SciELO exhibited more balanced thematic representation, whereas
Redalyc demonstrated a stronger emphasis on the Social Sciences and
Humanities.
