A coding scheme was developed based on established literature and
consisted of ten codes pertinent to dialogic classroom talk at
the utterance level. The scheme included ten categories organized into
three contexts—content, task, and off-topic—which serve to differentiate the tenor
of each utterance. Specifically, the codes allow for the classification
of utterances as either related to the content of the
task (i.e., the topic under discussion), related to task procedures
or classroom management, or as off-topic, referring to talk that
is not focused on either content or task (see Table
1).
