The documentation of Paresi was initiated at the request of
the Rio Formoso community, who expressed interest in recording their
traditional culture. In the EN Halataikwa community, contact was established
with a speaker of the language who invited the research
team to visit and present the project proposal. Permission to
record material was obtained from the communities under a non-profit
framework. The communities benefited from the production of DVDs, CDs,
and USB drives containing traditional stories and songs, as well
as from the training of indigenous teachers in linguistic documentation.
Additionally, the collected Paresi material provided the foundation for the
development of a reference grammar of the language, which was
presented as a doctoral thesis (Brand√£o, 2014).
