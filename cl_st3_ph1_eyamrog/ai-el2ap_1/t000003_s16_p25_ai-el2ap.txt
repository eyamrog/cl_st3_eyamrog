The six other teams consisted of adult players from various
districts of Timor-Leste. Within these football clubs, members were characterized
by a shared national identity as Timorese. During interviews with
the two organisers of the Ramkabian club, they explained that
the club’s name was formed by combining elements from the
names of three mountains in Timor-Leste: Ramelau, Kablake, and Matebian.
This naming strategy was intended to promote inclusivity, address diversity,
and foster solidarity among members. One organiser described the club’s
objectives, stating in a mixture of Portuguese and Tetum that
one aim was to “criar amizade que [é] forte, la’os
ba iha ne’é deit maibé iha fatin hotu-hotu” (creating friendship
that is strong, not only for this [club] but everywhere)
(Interview with RS and HA, June 7, 2015; all Portuguese
words are shown in italics). FC Lao Rai United was
similarly described, with one organiser noting that the club and
its participation in tournaments provided opportunities for Timorese from different
districts to interact and build relationships. The term Lao Rai
(Travellers) in the club’s name signified the shared identity of
the players as individuals who are mobile. A third club,
AS Bidau, also demonstrated an inclusive approach; its name refers
to a linguistically diverse neighbourhood in Dili, and the team
comprised players with varied language backgrounds.
