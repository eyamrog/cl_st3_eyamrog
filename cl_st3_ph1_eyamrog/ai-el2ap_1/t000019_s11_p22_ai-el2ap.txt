In the field of education, the process of digitalization has
largely mirrored economic trends, with a tendency to reduce investment
in teacher training and broader societal education, while increasing expenditure
on technologies that facilitate the administrative management of public departments
and the dissemination of didactic content without corresponding investment in
human resources (Libâneo, 2016a; Freitas, 2011; Evangelista, 2013). Regarding learning
outcomes, the replacement of teachers with digital didactic resources contributes
to the perpetuation of the existing educational system, which primarily
benefits dominant social groups, as the limited pedagogical quality of
such resources significantly undermines learning outcomes and fails to meet
even the technical objectives of educational training (Costa & Libâneo,
2018; Nascimento et al., 2020).
