The adopted solution involved taking screenshots of an initial archival
deposit to document the appearance and navigational structure of the
archive’s website. In preparation, Rosés Labrada and a schoolteacher visited
the AILLA and ELAR websites in Puerto Ayacucho, the capital
of Amazonas state. The schoolteacher agreed to deposit one of
his recorded stories to initiate a collection that would be
archived in both repositories. Following the deposit of a folder
containing all materials related to a single story, both archives
provided screenshots illustrating the appearance of the collection and the
deposited materials.
