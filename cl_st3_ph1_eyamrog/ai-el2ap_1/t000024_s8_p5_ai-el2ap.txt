Many species of epiphytic bromeliads are capable of absorbing nutrients
through both their aerial parts and roots (Nievola & Mercier
1996), as evidenced by their efficient growth in nursery conditions
when cultivated in pots with substrate (Negrelle et al. 2011).
Consequently, ground relocation may represent a viable management strategy. Previous
studies have reported successful relocation of bromeliads to soil, tree
trunks, or both substrates within the same community, irrespective of
their life strategy (Freitas et al. 1998; Benzing 2000; Ara√∫jo
2006). However, to date, no studies have directly compared the
efficiency of simultaneous relocation of bromeliads as epiphytes on trees
and as terrestrial individuals within the same crown projection area
of a single tree. Such an approach could facilitate the
relocation of a greater number of specimens in a single
operation, thereby optimizing fieldwork and reducing associated labor and operational
costs.
