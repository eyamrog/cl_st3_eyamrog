Table 2 presents the results regarding differences in neuropsychological development
and intelligence among preschool children from two provinces. According to
Student’s t-test, significant differences were observed in intelligence, manual dexterity,
manual gestures and praxis, verbal regulation of motor acts, visual
denomination of objects and figures, phonematic hearing, image-based vocabulary, numerical
operations, and rapid color naming, with higher scores in the
group from Sancti Spíritus. In contrast, significant differences in picture
naming and visual memory favored the group from Cienfuegos (see
Figure 1).
