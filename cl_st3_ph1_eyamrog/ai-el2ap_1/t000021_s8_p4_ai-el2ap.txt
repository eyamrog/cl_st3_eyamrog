Emotional labor is defined as a form of emotion regulation
undertaken in response to emotional demands in order to achieve
work-related outcomes (Grandey, 2000; Mallory & Rupp, 2016). According to
Grandey’s (2000) integrative model of emotional labor, events and emotion
rules within the work environment initiate and direct employees’ emotion
regulation processes, thereby influencing the choice and application of specific
regulatory strategies. Emotion regulation refers to the modulation of various
aspects of an emotional episode, including its context, intensity, valence,
frequency, and expression. This process involves physiological, behavioral, and cognitive
components (Aldao, 2013; Gross, 2015) and may be initiated either
automatically or deliberately when emotions are perceived as maladaptive or
inappropriate in a particular context (Gross, 2015).
