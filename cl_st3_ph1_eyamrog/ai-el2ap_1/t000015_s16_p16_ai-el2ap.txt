Twenty-five years after the study by Cetto and Alonso-Gamboa, the
Web of Science Citation Reports includes only 1.2% of JUOJS
titles (Table 3). The representation of JUOJS in EBSCO and
Scopus is only slightly higher. This limited coverage is significant
given that these three databases are frequently regarded as comprehensive
sources of the scientific literature. Researchers often rely on them
for conducting literature reviews and for analyzing patterns of scholarly
communication, including studies focused on the Global South (e.g., Cort√©s,
Guix, & Carbonell, 2021).
