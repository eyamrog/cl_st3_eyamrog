A second community-wide meeting was held on November 4, 2012,
in Arena Blanca following Rosés Labrada’s return with the screenshots.
The subsequent discussion was more informed in several respects. One
key request from the community was that original materials remain
within the community. This prompted the linguist to clarify aspects
of digital documentation, specifically that certain recordings were created in
digital format from the outset, that digital originals and copies
are indistinguishable, and that copies can be produced easily. This
situation contrasts with the use of cassettes or CDs/DVDs, with
which the community was more familiar, where originals and copies
are more readily differentiated and duplication is less straightforward.
