While the approximately 5 kbp rRNA operon represents the longest
repeat in many bacterial genomes, longer repetitive sequences can occur.
For instance, the chromosome of Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155 contains a
56 kbp duplication. In these cases, standard Oxford Nanopore Technologies
(ONT) read lengths of around 20 kbp may be inadequate
for complete assembly, and ultra-long reads of approximately 100 kbp
are required (Figure 2C).
