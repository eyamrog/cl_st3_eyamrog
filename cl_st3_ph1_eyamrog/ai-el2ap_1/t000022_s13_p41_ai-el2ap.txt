Of the 58,148 documents analyzed, 63% are coauthored, and the
data reveal patterns of within-country collaboration that suggest a more
nuanced interpretation than the binary framework of academic inbreeding versus
cross-breeding. Specifically, 59% of the documents are coauthored by individuals
affiliated with institutions in the same state, while 31.9% involve
collaboration between authors from institutions located in two different states.
Additionally, 9.1% of the documents feature authors from three or
more states, with the maximum observed collaboration spanning 26 different
states. Given the considerable complexity and heterogeneity of the country,
as well as the large number of universities and scientific
institutions, it is not accurate to categorize collaboration between two
Brazilian authors—or publication in a national journal—as academic inbreeding. Similarly,
collaborations between authors from different institutions within the same state
should not be automatically classified as such.
