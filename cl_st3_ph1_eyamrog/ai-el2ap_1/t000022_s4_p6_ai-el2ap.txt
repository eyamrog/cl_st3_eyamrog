The analysis of publications indexed in SciELO and Redalyc enables
a critical examination of assumptions underlying the recognition of scientific
knowledge, particularly the tendency to prioritize journals commonly classified as
"mainstream" while devaluing others. OLIVA identifies two key dimensions within
this scientific communication space, which is characterized by increasing editorial
quality: first, its diversity in terms of thematic and linguistic
scope; and second, the presence of international and inter-institutional collaboration
at the national level, which challenges the conventional dichotomy between
the "mainstream or global circuit"—dominated by highly prestigious journals—and the
"regional or local circuits," which typically have more limited dissemination.
This dichotomy, reinforced by journal commercialization and assessment systems that
emphasize Impact Factor, has contributed to the undervaluation of non-commercial
open access publications, such as those examined in this study.
Furthermore, this perspective has overlooked the complexity of intra-national collaboration,
which this paper seeks to highlight in the context of
Brazil, particularly regarding its significance for research focused on local
issues. The study also addresses the linguistic characteristics of Brazil,
which substantially influence collaboration patterns when nationally edited journals are
compared to mainstream journals.
