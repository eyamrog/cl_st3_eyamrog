With respect to seed storage behavior, the present findings suggest
that C. alba Morong seeds may be classified as desiccation-tolerant
(orthodox), as indicated by their low water content (ranging from
10% to 7%) and the maintenance of moderate germination percentages
following storage. According to Hong and Ellis (1996), orthodox seeds
are defined as those capable of tolerating desiccation to a
moisture content of ≤12% and remaining viable for up to
12 months of storage. However, these authors also emphasize the
need to assess seed survival under various storage conditions, including
lower temperatures (e.g., -20°C), to determine whether seeds exhibit intermediate
rather than orthodox storage behavior. Recent studies have demonstrated that
certain tropical Arecaceae species produce seeds that retain desiccation tolerance
after storage (Orozco-Segovia et al. 2003; Souza et al. 2016).
In the Cerrado, Acrocomia aculeata (Jacq.) Lodd. ex Mart. seeds
have been identified as desiccation-tolerant and can be stored for
over one year at low temperatures (10°C; Ribeiro et al.
2012). Ex situ seed conservation is a global concern (CBD
2010; Walters et al. 2013), yet the longevity of most
tropical palm seeds remains insufficiently understood (Broschat 1994; Pivetta et
al. 2011). The natural habitats of C. alba are subject
to extended drought periods, such as the multi-year dry spells
observed in the Pantanal (Thielen et al. 2020), including those
in 2020, suggesting that desiccation tolerance may be important for
the persistence of this species under such conditions. Nonetheless, the
effects of low-temperature storage and in vitro propagation methods on
C. alba seeds have not yet been investigated.
