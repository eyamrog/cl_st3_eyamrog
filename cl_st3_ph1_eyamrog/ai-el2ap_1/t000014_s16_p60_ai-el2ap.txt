These archives are currently available in English (ELAR) or in
both English and Spanish (AILLA), but they do not yet
provide access information in Portuguese, which limits accessibility for Paresi
and Enenawe Nawe community members. In the future, we plan
to make these collections available through regional digital archives located
closer to the communities, potentially housed at institutions such as
the Federal University of Mato Grosso (UFMT), intercultural colleges, or
indigenous schools. This approach would enable speakers to have direct
physical access to the servers where the materials are stored,
in addition to facilitating easier internet access.
