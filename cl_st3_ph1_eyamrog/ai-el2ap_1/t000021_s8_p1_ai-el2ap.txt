Over the past two decades, the field of emotion regulation
has experienced significant growth in both theoretical and empirical research
(Gross, 2015). Despite this expansion, its application within educational research
has only recently gained attention (Taxer & Gross, 2018; Yin,
2016). Recent literature reviews focusing on teachers' emotions (e.g., Fried,
Mansfield, & Dobozy, 2015; Uitto, Jokikokko, & Estola, 2015) identify
emotion regulation as a key area of investigation, particularly in
light of the high prevalence of burnout and negative impacts
on teachers' well-being, which are partially attributed to emotion dysregulation
and the emotional demands of the profession (e.g., Chang, 2013;
Yin et al., 2016). Furthermore, empirical studies indicate that effective
emotion regulation is associated with improved professional performance, enhanced mental
health among teachers, and more positive teacher-student interactions (e.g., Chang
& Davis, 2009; Taxer & Frenzel, 2015; Yin, 2015).
