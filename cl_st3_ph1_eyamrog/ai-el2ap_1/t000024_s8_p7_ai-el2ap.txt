This study aims to evaluate the simultaneous relocation of the
bromeliad species Aechmea distichantha and Wittrockia cyathiformis, which were rescued
from an area affected by road construction, to a nearby
Montane Dense Ombrophilous Forest as a strategy to mitigate the
effects of deforestation. These species were selected due to their
high abundance in the deforested region. The research seeks to
contribute to the mitigation of deforestation impacts by promoting the
conservation of native species and the maintenance of genetic diversity.
Additionally, the study provides information on the development of low-cost
techniques intended to increase both the speed and success rate
of Bromeliaceae colonization in restoration efforts.
