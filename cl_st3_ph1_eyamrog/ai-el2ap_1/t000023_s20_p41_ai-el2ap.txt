The cell is approximately 1.1 times longer than broad, with
a deep median constriction and a linear sinus that is
slightly open near the extremity. The semicells are rectangular with
a truncate apex, concave lateral margins, and rounded apical and
basal angles. The cell wall is smooth, containing a single
chloroplast and one pyrenoid per semicell. Cell dimensions are as
follows: length 11.1–12.9 µm, width 9.7–11.6 µm, and isthmus 3.5–4.8
µm.
