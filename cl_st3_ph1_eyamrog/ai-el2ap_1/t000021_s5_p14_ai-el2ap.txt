Finally, behavioral strategies such as deep breathing and counting to
ten have been identified as effective methods for reducing emotional
arousal (Akbari et al., 2017; BuriÄ‡ et al., 2016; Yin,
2016). These techniques appear to assist teachers in managing reactive
emotional impulses during highly stressful situations and in decreasing tension
and negative emotions experienced in the classroom (Chang & Davis,
2009; Sutton, 2004).
