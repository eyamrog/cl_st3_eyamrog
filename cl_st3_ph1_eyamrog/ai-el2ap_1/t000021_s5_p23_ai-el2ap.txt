Although comparable empirical studies have not been identified, existing research
suggests that teachers in foundational subject areas demonstrate greater emotional
awareness and a broader emotional repertoire. This increased emotional competence
appears to facilitate a more purposeful and outcome-oriented response to
professional demands (Gross, 2014). Supporting this observation, Castejón, Cantero, and
Pérez (2010) report that professionals trained in technology-related fields tend
to pay less attention to emotions compared to those in
disciplines such as social sciences, education, and humanities.
