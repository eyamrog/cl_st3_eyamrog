As the mobility paradigm has developed within sociolinguistics and the
broader social sciences, there has been increasing divergence in scholarly
perspectives. One strand of research (e.g., Cresswell, 2002; Brenner, 2004;
Hannam et al., 2006; Urry, 2007) critiques studies that focus
exclusively on mobility and adopt deterritorialized approaches, which are seen
as promoting a new "grand narrative" of mobility, fluidity, or
liquidity as defining features of postmodernity or globalization (Hannam et
al., 2006, p. 5). These scholars contend that analyses of
mobility are incomplete without consideration of moorings and processes of
reterritorialization. They maintain that forms of detachment or deterritorialization are
invariably accompanied by various types of rhizomic attachments and reterritorializations
(Hannam et al., 2006, p. 3).
