After a period of illegality in the first half of
the twentieth century, during which capoeira was associated with street
gang conflicts involving groups known as maltas (PORTAL CAPOEIRA, 2022a),
the practice has undergone significant transformation and is now recognized
as a prominent symbol of Brazilian identity. Currently, capoeira is
widely practiced throughout Brazil and has achieved international popularity, with
capoeira schools established in major cities across Europe.
