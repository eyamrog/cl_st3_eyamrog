At the conclusion of the interview, each participant was requested
to provide the teacher/researcher with a review they had received
for a paper that was either accepted or rejected by
a high-impact computer science journal. A total of 17 texts
were submitted via email, corresponding to 12 distinct publication processes;
of these, four resulted in rejection and eight in acceptance.
For data analysis, Huckinâ€™s (2004) content analysis methodology was employed,
and AntConc software was utilized to extract specific information from
the texts.
