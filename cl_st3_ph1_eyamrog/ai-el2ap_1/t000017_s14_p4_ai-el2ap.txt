Data were collected during the final evaluation of the educational
process, conducted between June and July 2019, across nine groups
of children. Each group was evaluated by its respective educator,
all of whom were female (n=9). Prior to this, the
educators participated in methodological training workshops at the beginning of
the school year, between September and October 2018, consisting of
two weekly sessions of 45 minutes each over the course
of one month. The educators demonstrated satisfactory performance in the
training, acquiring the necessary skills to administer the assessment instrument
and integrate it into the educational process to support child
development. Using this preparation, the educators conducted individual evaluations of
the children at the end of the school year, with
each child assessed in two sessions lasting between 10 and
15 minutes each. The sessions were typically held in the
morning, following the standardized protocol of the B-PREA-R.
