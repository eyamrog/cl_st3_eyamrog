Sandroâ€™s contextualization of capoeira practice for the group is closely
linked to the history of Black Brazilians. Consequently, it is
necessary to situate capoeira within its historical context and to
describe the conditions under which it emerged and developed, specifically
during the colonial period that began with the arrival of
the Portuguese in 1500. This era was marked by the
widespread use of enslaved labor and various forms of resistance
by enslaved populations. The following section provides a concise overview
of this complex historical background. Portuguese colonization initially focused on
the northeastern coast of Brazil, where the first cities and
ports were established. The tropical climate of this region was
conducive to sugarcane cultivation, which required significant manual labor that
was not readily available in the newly colonized territory (see
Skidmore & Green, 2021).
