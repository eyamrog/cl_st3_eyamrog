On average, 70% of the population has access to the
Internet, with over 90% of this access occurring via cell
phones (CGI.br, 2019a). While cell phone access increases the likelihood
of Internet connectivity, it may also reflect reduced purchasing power,
limited familiarity with computer use, and/or challenges in acquiring computers
and higher-quality Internet services. Additionally, cell phone usage is typically
associated with rapid, routine activities and does not necessarily indicate
proficiency in the academic or professional application of digital tools.
For activities that require extended study, such as reading or
tasks involving digital content creation, computers are generally considered more
appropriate devices.
