In the subtest assessing the counting of non-symbolic quantities, which
is analogous to the "quantitative concepts" subtest, Series A, of
the Woodcock-Muñoz Battery III achievement test (Muñoz-Sandoval et al., 2005),
the child is required to identify quantities ranging from 3
to 12 elements within a figure and subsequently locate the
same quantity among four presented options. This task involves numerical
cognitive processing operations such as enumeration and quantity comparison. Additionally,
successful performance necessitates that the child maintains the goal of
problem-solving and utilizes a range of numerical, verbal, and visual
reasoning strategies (Spiegel et al., 2021).
