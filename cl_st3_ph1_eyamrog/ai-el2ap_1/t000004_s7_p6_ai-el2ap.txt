Each phase of the capoeira session is characterized by distinct
combinations of communicative modalities. In the first, expository phase observed
in our ethnographic study, both English explanations and Portuguese are
integrated with music, enabling contramestre Sandro to facilitate connections between
the group and the cultural context embedded in the song
lyrics. During the second, practice phase, as participants rehearse movements
individually or in pairs, Sandro adopts an instructional register that
incorporates English, Portuguese, gesture, and bodily demonstration. In the final
roda phase, explicit instructional support is withdrawn, and participants (jogadores)
engage in applying their skills and strategies with each other
and the contramestre. In this phase, communication is primarily nonverbal,
as meaning is conveyed through gesture and movement, and participants
express themselves through the nuanced execution of movements characteristic of
the regulated improvisation inherent to the capoeira habitus.
