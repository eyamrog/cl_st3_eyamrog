Interpretive researchers aim to understand and interpret the world from
the perspective of its participants (Cohen et al., 2007, p.
26) and to analyze the context-specific meaning of human experiences
(Treagust et al., 2014). This research tradition primarily utilizes qualitative
methods to examine social situations and to construct meaning based
on the data collected.
