Language detection software identified that the JUOJS published research in
60 different languages, with the presence of each language confirmed
through manual verification of at least one example journal (Table
1). The language classifications for all ISSN-verified JUOJS (n =
22,561) were provided to Google Scholar to facilitate the expansion
of its journal indexing to include additional languages.
