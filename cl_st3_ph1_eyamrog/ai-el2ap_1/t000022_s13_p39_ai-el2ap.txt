In this final section, a complementary data source is analyzed
to provide a more detailed characterization of national collaboration in
the country. The analysis focuses on the metadata of articles
published in journals from the SciELO Brazil collection over the
five-year period from 2016 to 2020, comprising a total of
104,750 documents. This metadata was extracted from SciELO in May
2021 and represents the portion of the database in which
author names and institutional affiliations have been standardized, thereby enabling
more accurate analysis. The dataset includes authors from 162 countries.
In 74.5% of the cases, all authors are affiliated with
Brazilian institutions, with 23.6% of these articles having only a
single author. In 18.3% of the cases, all authors are
affiliated with institutions outside Brazil. Only 7.1% of the documents
involve collaboration between authors affiliated with Brazilian and non-Brazilian institutions.
These results closely resemble those presented in Figure 6. Among
the articles co-authored by Brazilian and foreign researchers, only 17%
involve collaboration with Latin American countries, a pattern that is
largely influenced by linguistic factors, as previously discussed.
