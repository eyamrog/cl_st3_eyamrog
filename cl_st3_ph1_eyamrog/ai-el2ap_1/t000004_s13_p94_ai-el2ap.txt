During a capoeira game, both participants closely observe each other
in an effort to anticipate and respond to their opponent’s
movements, either by executing an attack or evading using techniques
from their repertoire. At times, they may engage in synchronized
ginga movements, mirroring each other’s actions. Nevertheless, even during these
synchronized sequences, there remains a persistent awareness of the possibility
of an imminent attack from either participant.
