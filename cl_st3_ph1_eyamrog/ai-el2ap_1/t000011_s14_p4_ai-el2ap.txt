We determined the fracture toughness of leaf laminae using the
Lucas Scientific FLS-1 portable mechanical tester (FLS-1, São Paulo, Brazil),
following a standard scissors test protocol as described by Lucas
and Pereira (1990) and Lucas et al. (2001). At four-hour
intervals, a new flat section from the center of the
leaf lamina, oriented parallel to and between secondary veins, was
excised using a razor blade. Strips measuring 2.5 mm in
length and 1.5 mm in width were mounted perpendicularly between
the blades of the scissors attached to the mechanical tester.
The crosshead of the tester lowered the blade handle, and
the load required to cut through the leaf section was
recorded as a function of displacement, yielding the total work
performed (Wc). Subsequently, the scissors were returned to their initial
position, the leaf sample was removed, and the scissors were
operated again over the same displacement without a sample to
measure the frictional work (Wf), referred to as the "empty
pass." The frictional work from the empty pass was subtracted
from the total work to obtain the fracture work. Prior
to each test, the scissor blades were cleaned to eliminate
any residue from previous samples. The length of the cut
(L; mm) and the thickness of the leaf lamina (t;
mm) were measured using a sensitive dial caliper, and the
cleaved area was calculated as the product of thickness and
cut length. Fracture toughness (R; J m⁻²) for each sample
was calculated as the fracture work divided by the cleaved
area, using the formula R = (Wc - Wf) /
(L × t).
