Focusing specifically on the activities surrounding the football clubs provided
valuable insights into the complex and multifaceted processes of identity
formation within this migration context. Various Timorese identities were constructed
in relation to both historical and contemporary factors. These identities
were expressed through linguistic resources as well as a range
of semiotic resources, including images, colors, and various material, textual,
and online elements. As indicated in Table 2, some clubs
emphasized regional identity, while others promoted inclusivity and a broader
sense of Timorese identity. Certain branding practices, such as the
use of national flag colors in club logos (Figure 1)
and medal ribbons (Figure 3), signaled national identity. Additionally, some
clubs incorporated symbols of cultural heritage, such as the woven
tais and the crocodile motif. Linguistic resources and symbols associated
with international football culture were also integrated into these diverse
representations of Timorese identity.
