Argentina exhibits distinct characteristics in its publication patterns. The country
has the lowest proportion (56.4%) of articles published in its
journals with at least one Argentine author, indicating a stronger
tendency to publish internationally compared to Chile. However, alternative explanations
should be considered. Evidence suggests that Argentine journals are underrepresented
in the OLIVA database, primarily due to the traditional selection
criteria for social science and humanities journals in Argentina, which
are influenced by the Latindex catalog. This selection process is
shaped by the prevailing assessment culture at CONICET (the National
Science Council) and national universities, where publications indexed in Latindex
are valued equivalently to those in SciELO, Scopus, and WoS
(Beigel, 2014). Additionally, the technical requirements for inclusion in Latindex
Catalog 2.0 are less stringent than those for SciELO and
Redalyc, and the national Latindex node in Argentina holds significant
influence. A comparison of journals from Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Mexico,
and Colombia in Latindex Catalog 2.0 and the OLIVA database
reveals that Chile has 144 journals in OLIVA and 167
in Latindex Catalog 2.0, while Argentina has 316 journals in
Latindex Catalog 2.0 but only 167 in SciELO or Redalyc,
nearly double the number. Furthermore, most Argentine journals in the
OLIVA database that are not classified under social sciences and
humanities are indexed in SciELO (43 out of 69).
