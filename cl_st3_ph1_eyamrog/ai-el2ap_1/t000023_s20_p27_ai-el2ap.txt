The cell is 1.4 to 1.5 times longer than broad,
with a deep median constriction and a linear sinus. Semicells
are pyramidal, with the apex either sharply pointed or truncate
and rounded; basal angles range from rounded to straight. The
cell wall is smooth and may be thickened at the
apex. Each cell contains a single chloroplast, with one pyrenoid
per semicell. Cell dimensions are as follows: length 20–38.2 µm,
width 13–26.7 µm, and isthmus 4.4–9.7 µm.
