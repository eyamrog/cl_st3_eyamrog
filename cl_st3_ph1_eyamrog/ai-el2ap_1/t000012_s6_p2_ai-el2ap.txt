Opportunism is a common behavior among bird species. For instance,
caracaras (Falconidae) utilize a wide range of resources, including fruits,
carcasses, and arthropods. These birds have been observed interacting with
a diverse array of mammals, suggesting that they may occupy
a central position within community interaction networks. Caracaras exhibit generalist
tendencies not only in their diet but also in their
interactions with various host species. However, caracaras represent an exception
to the typical pattern of opportunistic behavior in cleaning interactions,
as there is no significant correlation between their network centrality
and dietary diversity. This lack of correlation indicates that generalism
and specialism are multidimensional concepts, influenced by different organizational levels
that shape biodiversity patterns (Levin, 1992). Some cleaner birds are
generalists in terms of the variety of host species they
interact with, yet are dietary specialists. For example, Oxpeckers (Buphagus
sp.) are specialized in cleaning interactions, feeding exclusively on parasites
found on large mammals. While they are central within the
interaction network due to their associations with multiple mammal species,
their diet is specialized, focusing on small arthropods inhabiting these
hosts. Despite the morphological and physiological diversity of these parasites,
Oxpeckers are considered dietary specialists compared to birds that consume
a broader range of food types. Therefore, opportunistic behavior, while
facilitating engagement in facultative interactions, can also result in specialized
ecological strategies, potentially leading to close associations between cleaner birds
and their frequent hosts.
