Sandro discusses the linguistic characteristics of older songs, noting that
although there is a wide variety of such songs, they
often receive little attention. He observes that the language used
in these songs differs significantly from contemporary usage. For instance,
when he shares song lyrics with Mariana, who is Brazilian,
she is often unable to understand them due to the
presence of regional dialects and archaic vocabulary. Sandro highlights that
these songs frequently employ terms associated with marginalized groups within
society. He provides the example of the word “vapor,” which,
while commonly understood today to mean “steam,” historically referred to
a “steamboat.” As a result, contemporary listeners may misinterpret the
intended meaning. He further notes that without studying the historical
and linguistic context of these songs, modern audiences are unlikely
to fully comprehend the works of earlier composers. Additionally, he
mentions that terms such as “tabibeira” and “Piauí”—the latter being
a state in Northeast Brazil—were once used to refer to
boats, and that such usage may now be perceived as
a different language, despite its historical authenticity.
