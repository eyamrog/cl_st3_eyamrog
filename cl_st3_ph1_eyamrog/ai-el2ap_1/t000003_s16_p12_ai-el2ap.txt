The communicative challenges encountered by new arrivals when interacting with
Irish authorities and accessing social services are reflected in recent
health and social care statistics from Northern Ireland. Doyle and
McAreavey (2016) report that, between 1 April and 30 June
2014, Tetum was among the six most frequently requested languages
for interpreter services in health and social care settings. During
this three-month period, a total of 24,158 interpreter requests were
recorded for 41 different languages across Northern Ireland.
