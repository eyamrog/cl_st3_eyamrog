In his work on the sociolinguistics of globalization, Blommaert (2010)
advocated for a "sociolinguistics of mobile resources," emphasizing the need
to account for the diverse material and symbolic connections formed
within global networks. He contended that sociolinguistic analysis should conceptualize
linguistic and semiotic phenomena as situated and distributed across multiple
scales, ranging from the global to the local, and should
specifically examine the relationships between these scales.
