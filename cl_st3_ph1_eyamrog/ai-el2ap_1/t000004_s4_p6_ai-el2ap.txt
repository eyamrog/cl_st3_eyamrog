Our observations and recordings indicate that, both at a fundamental
level and through embodied practice, capoeiristas acquire significant elements of
Afro-Brazilian language and culture. This occurs through exposure to songs,
sayings, historical narratives, and the specialized register of capoeira, some
aspects of which may not be familiar to all Brazilians.
These elements are mediated and translanguaged into English by Sandro.
Additionally, learners are exposed to instructional language in Portuguese, which
is made comprehensible either through the integration of gesture and
embodied action or, in the context of workshops, through Sandro’s
interpretation. For instance, we observed that Marianne was able to
respond appropriately to the Mestre’s apology with “tudo bem.” However,
we conclude that while these practices provide an initial foundation,
they are insufficient without the support of additional learning methods.
We suggest that engagement with capoeira could also enhance more
conventional Portuguese language education, such as at the tertiary level,
where students could benefit from the in-depth exposure to Afro-Brazilian
language and culture that capoeira offers.
