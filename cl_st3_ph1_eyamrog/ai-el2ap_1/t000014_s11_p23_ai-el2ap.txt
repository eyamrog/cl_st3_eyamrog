A widely endorsed principle among archivists is to "archive early
and archive often." Many language archives advocate for progressive or
incremental archiving, whereby researchers or research teams submit primary data—such
as audio and video recordings and photographs—together with relevant metadata
(including participant names, dates, locations, languages used, and contextual descriptions)
to a digital repository as soon as possible after the
creation of the media files (see step 1 in Figure
3). Secondary data, such as annotations, transcriptions, and interlinear glossed
texts, as well as analyses or academic outputs (steps 2
and 3 in Figure 3, respectively), are added subsequently once
they are finalized (Robinson, 2006; Nathan, 2013; Kung et al.,
2020). In Figure 3, these steps are conceptualized as successive
waves of archiving. Step 1, involving the archiving of primary
data and associated metadata, should occur immediately after the completion
of fieldwork or data collection, or even concurrently with these
activities. Step 2, which pertains to the archiving of secondary
data and relevant metadata, can be conducted iteratively as transcriptions
and translations are completed. Step 3, involving the archiving of
finalized analyses and academic outputs along with their metadata, can
also be performed iteratively and may extend well into the
future. This approach acknowledges that there is rarely an optimal
time for researchers to archive language documentation data. Delays between
data collection and archiving, as well as the accumulation of
digital files and physical materials, tend to increase the complexity
and duration of the archiving process. Furthermore, organizing materials and
ensuring comprehensive metadata is generally more efficient immediately following fieldwork
or data collection, when details are most readily recalled.
