Students typically spend the time before class begins stretching individually,
while some engage in conversation, often discussing recent events since
their last meeting. These conversations are generally conducted in English;
however, students who grew up speaking Portuguese tend to use
Portuguese when communicating among themselves and with peers who are
fluent in the language. For example, Tiago communicates in Portuguese
with Mariana and Sandro, who are Brazilian, as well as
with Sophie and Carolina, both of whom are fluent in
Portuguese.
