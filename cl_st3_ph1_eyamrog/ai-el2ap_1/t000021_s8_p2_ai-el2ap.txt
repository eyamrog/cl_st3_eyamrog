Bahia, Freire, Amaral, and Estrela (2013) and Taxer and Frenzel
(2015) assert that teachers' emotional experiences involve a wide range
of both genuinely expressed and regulated emotions. However, existing research
has predominantly concentrated on a limited set of self-regulation strategies,
particularly cognitive reappraisal and suppression (Taxer & Gross, 2018). Moreover,
these studies are often conducted in decontextualized settings and do
not adequately capture emotion regulation as it occurs in classroom
environments (e.g., Chang, 2013; Uitto et al., 2015), which may
result in incomplete or premature conclusions (Gross, 2014). Therefore, it
is important to examine how contextual factors influence teachers' emotional
experiences and their choice of regulatory strategies, as most research
adopts an intrapersonal perspective and tends to overlook interpersonal and
situational dimensions (English, Lee, John, & Gross, 2017; Fried et
al., 2015; Uitto et al., 2015).
