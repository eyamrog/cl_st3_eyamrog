Empirical evidence indicates that teachers employ a range of emotion
regulation strategies in classroom settings (Akbari et al., 2017; Taxer
& Gross, 2018). For example, some teachers utilize strategies aimed
at preventing engagement with student misbehavior, while others adopt reactive
approaches such as temporarily leaving the classroom to regain emotional
composure (Akbari et al., 2017; Sutton, 2004). Taxer and Gross
(2018) reported that teachers predominantly use response modulation strategies, such
as emotional suppression. Conversely, Sutton (2004) and BuriÄ‡ et al.
(2016) found a preference among teachers for cognitive change strategies,
including reappraisal. Additionally, Akbari et al. (2017) observed a greater
tendency among teachers to employ situation selection and modification strategies.
Collectively, these studies present inconsistent findings regarding the emotion regulation
strategies favored by teachers. Such discrepancies may be partially attributable
to contextual variables that have not been sufficiently examined in
prior research (Fried et al., 2015).
