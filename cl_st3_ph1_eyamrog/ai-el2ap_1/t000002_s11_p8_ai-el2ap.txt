Both paradigms have been subject to criticism. Positivist research is
often regarded as superficial and restrictive, as it may fail
to account for underlying contradictions and tends to assume that
findings or solutions are universally applicable across different contexts (Taber,
2013). Conversely, interpretivist studies are sometimes criticized for relying on
anecdotal evidence or lacking methodological rigor, which can limit the
generalizability and scalability of their findings.
