Community members may engage with an archive to varying degrees
of directness. A notable example of direct engagement is the
“Verdena Parker Collection of Hupa Sound Recordings and Films” (PARKER,
n.d., held by the California Language Archive). Verdena Parker, a
native speaker of Hupa (Dene, also known as Athabaskan; California),
produced sound recordings and films over several decades and later
collaborated with linguists from the University of California, Berkeley on
a documentation project initiated in 2005 (see PARKER et al.,
2005+). The materials, archived in 2010, comprise texts, vocabulary, translations,
and ethnographic observations related to life in Hoopa Valley, and
are intended to support language revitalization programs.
