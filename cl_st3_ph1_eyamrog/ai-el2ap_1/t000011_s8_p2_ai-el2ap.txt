In plants, stem and leaf samples consist of complex tissues
associated with distinct functions (Niklas et al. 2006; Vincent 1992;
Wegst & Ashby 2004). For instance, fibers and sclerenchyma contribute
to mechanical support, whereas parenchyma primarily serves a storage function
but also directly affects the flexibility of woody stems by
increasing it (Niklas 1992; Speck & Rowe 1999; MÃ©nard et
al. 2009; Gerolamo et al. 2020). The specific combinations and
arrangements of tissue and cell types in stems, roots, and
leaves result in a range of mechanical properties that correspond
to the types of mechanical stresses experienced by each plant
organ (Niklas 1992). The water content within these complex tissues
is also a significant factor influencing their mechanical properties (Niklas
1992; Vincent 1990a). Generally, dehydration of biological materials induces structural
changes in tissues and organs, thereby altering their mechanical properties
(Caliaro et al. 2013; Niklas 1992; Niklas et al. 2006;
Vincent 1990b). For example, grass leaves exhibit a gradual increase
in stiffness and toughness as water content decreases (Vincent 1983).
Similarly, in the stems of self-supporting species, bending stiffness increases
as wood tissue moisture content declines, and dry branches become
more brittle and susceptible to fracture compared to hydrated branches
(Niklas 1992). More recent experimental evidence indicates that the petioles
of Caladium bicolor lose bending stiffness under increased water deficit,
resulting in wilting (Caliaro et al. 2013).
