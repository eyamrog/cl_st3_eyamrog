Legacy materials frequently contain the linguistic data and knowledge of
individuals who predate more recent documentation initiatives by several decades,
and in some instances, these individuals may have been the
last first-language speakers or semi-speakers of a language. In such
contexts, legacy materials can serve as essential sources of information
for community-led language revitalization and cultural heritage maintenance or reclamation,
as well as for scholarly research aimed at understanding the
diversity and complexity of human linguistic expression.
