The Chi-square test was employed to assess the equivalence of
certain demographic variables, such as sex, between study groups. An
independent samples t-test was conducted to compare the means of
the groups on various neuropsychological variables and measures of intelligence.
Effect size was calculated to quantify the magnitude of observed
differences, using Cohen's d, with values of 0.2, 0.5, and
0.8 interpreted as small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively.
