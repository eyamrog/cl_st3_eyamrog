Websites enable content sharing and can be configured to enhance
discoverability by search engines through the addition of appropriate code.
Although it is possible to restrict access to website content,
implementing such restrictions can present technical challenges. By default, traditional
copyright protection applies to website content; however, developers have the
option to apply specific rights statements or open licenses, such
as those provided by Creative Commons, to individual webpages and
associated files.
