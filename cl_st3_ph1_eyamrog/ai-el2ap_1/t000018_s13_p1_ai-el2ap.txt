A literature review was conducted to achieve the objectives of
the study. Article selection was based on three main criteria:
(1) relevance to the topic of child assessment in preschool-aged
children; (2) use of specific search equations in various databases,
including "assessment AND preschool AND neuropsychology," "assessment AND preschool AND
Luria," "preschool AND neuropsychology," and "preschool AND Luria"; and (3)
publication year and language, with articles published between 2015 and
2022 in either Spanish or English. The search was performed
across eight databases: SCOPUS, Web of Science (WOS), SCIELO, PUBMED,
DIALNET, LATINDEX, SCIENCEGATE, and EBSCO. To further refine the search,
two additional steps were taken: direct consultation of the Luria
Journal, a Russian journal not indexed in the aforementioned databases,
and an advanced search using Google Scholar to identify journals
indexed in SCOPUS and WOS, due to limited access to
these databases. A total of 36 articles were ultimately selected
for review (see Table 1).
