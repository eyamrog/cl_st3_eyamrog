In recent decades, Luria's cultural neuropsychology has become increasingly influential
in the assessment and rehabilitation of preschool children (Solovieva &
Quintanar, 2021; Solovieva et al., 2019; Bonilla-SÃ¡nchez et al., 2019;
Cadavid-Ruiz et al., 2019). This approach is grounded in Vygotsky's
sociocultural theory and is based on two main principles: (1)
child development occurs within a sociocultural context, and (2) mental
processes have a systemic structure. The first principle posits that
children's development is shaped by intersubjective activities that take place
during upbringing and education within specific social and cultural environments.
The second principle asserts that mental processes should not be
considered as isolated functions (such as attention, language, or memory),
but rather as components of an integrated system (Solovieva &
Quintanar, 2021; Solovieva et al., 2019).
