This method enabled the identification of general patterns in small-group
discussions that emerged in a Brazilian primary school and facilitated
the examination of differences over time. Temporal differences were assessed
by measuring the relative frequencies of code occurrences. The findings
presented here illustrate the positive aspects previously discussed. However, a
significant limitation of this analysis is the inability to capture
the temporal development of meanings and the inherent ambiguity, as
individual utterances may serve multiple functions. Additionally, some scholars have
argued that coding can be atheoretical or lead to dogmatic
conclusions (Hennessy et al., 2020).
