In the present study, a cross-sectional comparative design was employed
from January to December 2019. Seventy-seven children aged 5 and
6 years with typical development were selected and subdivided into
groups based on their province of residence (Sancti Spíritus and
Cienfuegos) as shown in Table 1. The groups were balanced
according to sex to ensure methodological parity across the provinces.
Analysis of the group distribution indicated no significant differences between
the groups (χ2 = 0.633), demonstrating normal equivalence.
