Given the scenario outlined, the insufficient technological infrastructure in both
public schools and households supports the conclusion that neither environment
is adequately prepared to implement a curriculum that requires the
use of digital equipment and technical knowledge. This challenge is
further compounded by the inadequate training of teachers, which limits
their ability to effectively integrate their subject expertise with digital
information and communication technologies (DICT) in curriculum development.
