Pteridium is distributed globally, with the exception of Antarctica, and
is considered highly significant due to its direct impacts on
human populations. It acts as a pioneer weed, invading agricultural
lands and spreading through extensive underground rhizomes, which complicates its
removal. Pteridium is toxic to livestock such as cattle and
horses, and it can also cause poisoning in humans when
ingested. Additionally, several studies have indicated that its toxins, specifically
ptaquiloside, can be transmitted to humans through cow milk (e.g.,
