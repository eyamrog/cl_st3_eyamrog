These trends in the social sciences exhibit some variation when
the analysis is disaggregated by the country of publication of
the journals. Journals published in Brazil, Cuba, and Puerto Rico
have, on average, 38.6% of their articles authored by a
single individual, a proportion significantly lower than the overall average
for the field. In contrast, journals in the social sciences
from Bolivia and Ecuador are predominantly characterized by single authorship,
with rates of 76.8% and 77.4%, respectively. For journals published
in the remaining nine countries (excluding Panama, which has no
relevant journals), the proportion of single-authored articles ranges from 53.8%
in Colombia to 62.4% in Mexico. In the humanities, differences
between countries are also observed, though they are less pronounced.
In Cuba, 64.2% of articles in humanities journals are single-authored,
while in Brazil the figure is 70%, closely followed by
Uruguay at 70.1% and Chile at 73.6%. In Argentina, the
proportion exceeds 80%, while in Mexico and Costa Rica, the
rates are 87.6% and 89.2%, respectively.
