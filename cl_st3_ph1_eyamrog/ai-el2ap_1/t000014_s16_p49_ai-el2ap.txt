Extensive documentation and description are now available for the Paresi
language, primarily through the independent efforts of Ana Paula Brandão
and Glauber Silva over several years. Key descriptive works on
Paresi include Silva (2009, 2013) and Brandão (2010, 2014). In
contrast, research on Enawene Nawe (EN) is relatively recent, with
the principal descriptive sources being Rezende (2003, 2013), Brandão and
Reis (2020), and Reis (2020). Although the project ‘Sketch grammar,
texts, and dictionary of Enawene Nawe (Arawak, Brazil)’ received funding
from the Endangered Languages Documentation Program (ELDP) in 2005, it
was not completed. In 2019, Brandão secured additional ELDP funding,
administered through the Federal University of Pará, for the project
‘Documentation of the Enawene Nawe language’.
