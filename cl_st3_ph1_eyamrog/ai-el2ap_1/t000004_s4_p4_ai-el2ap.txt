The integration of systematic language learning into the structure of
capoeira classes has been addressed in the recent curriculum proposal
"Português para capoeiristas" by the Ministério das Relações Exteriores (2020).
Adopting a Language for Specific Purposes approach, this proposal forms
part of a broader collection of curricular initiatives aimed at
teaching Portuguese in specific contexts abroad, with the objective of
addressing methodological gaps in Portuguese instruction at cultural centres and
affiliated institutions outside Brazil. The curriculum utilizes capoeira songs, as
well as texts and videos related to capoeira, and incorporates
references beyond capoeira, such as the artist Caribé, Brazilian dances
like samba de roda and frevo, and musicians including Gilberto
Gil, Dorival Caymmi, and Caetano Veloso. The proposal acknowledges that
certain language forms are unique to capoeira, dedicating an entire
unit to capoeira-specific slang (Unidade 13: a gíria do capoeira).
While the initiative to integrate Portuguese language teaching within capoeira
classes represents a positive step towards fostering greater language independence,
which is essential for advancement in capoeira, its focus remains
exclusively on linguistic aspects.
