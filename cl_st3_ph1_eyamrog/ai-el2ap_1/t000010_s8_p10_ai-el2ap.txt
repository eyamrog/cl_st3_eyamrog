In response to these limitations, the present study aims to
(1) assess the variability in neuropsychological test performance between groups
of preschool children with typical development from the provinces of
Cienfuegos and Sancti Spiritus in Cuba, and (2) identify the
neuropsychological functions that contribute to intellectual performance, considering that while
both provinces have distinct cultural characteristics, they share a similar
educational policy.
