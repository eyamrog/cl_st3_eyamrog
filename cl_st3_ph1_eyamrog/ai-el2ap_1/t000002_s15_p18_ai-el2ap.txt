To address whether the groups became more dialogic (question 3),
the aggregated results for non-dialogic utterances (the sum of codes
1, 3, and 5) were compared with those classified as
dialogic (codes 2, 4, and 6). Since the dialogic and
non-dialogic measures are complementary, statistical analysis was conducted on only
one of these categories.
