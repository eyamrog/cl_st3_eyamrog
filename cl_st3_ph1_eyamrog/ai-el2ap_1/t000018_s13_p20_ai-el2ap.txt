A neuropsychology specialist, drawing on Luria's theory, examines human actions
to analyze the psychophysiological aspects of activity; in contrast, an
educator may also observe a child's actions, but with the
aim of assessing overall development. Specifically, a neuropsychologist evaluates a
child's drawing to analyze neuropsychological factors and to make judgments
regarding the maturation of relevant brain regions, whereas an educator
examines the same drawing to assess motor skills, the child's
interaction with objects, personal engagement with the drawing process, as
well as the values, habits, concentration, and adherence to objectives
that may be reflected in the drawing.
