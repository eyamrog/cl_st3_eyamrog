This section presents two case studies that exemplify language documentation
and archiving efforts in Brazil, focusing on projects conducted in
collaboration with the Paresi-Haliti and Enawene Nawe communities under the
leadership of Ana Paula Brandão. Following a brief overview of
these two languages, the section details the documentation projects (§6.1)
and the resulting archival collections (§6.2).
