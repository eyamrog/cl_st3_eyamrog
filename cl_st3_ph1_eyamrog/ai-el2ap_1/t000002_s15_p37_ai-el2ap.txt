Although this was a why-question, the presence of substantial cues
indicating the correct answer led to it not being coded
as a dialogic invitation. In lines 87 and 88, the
teacher provided a nearly complete explanation, omitting only the final
term—‘vapour’—for the student to supply. Upon receiving this anticipated response,
the teacher continued the explanation, connecting vapour, scent, and its
dispersion throughout the room. This sequence constituted an explanatory construction,
despite the teacher’s use of a narrowly focused, leading line
of reasoning.
