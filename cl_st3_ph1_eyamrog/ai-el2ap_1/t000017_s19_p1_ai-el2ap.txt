The item-total correlation analysis indicated adequate values. Among the 199
items assessed, 61 items (30%) demonstrated high quality, 132 items
(66%) demonstrated good quality, and 6 items (4%) demonstrated fair
quality, as shown in Table 3. The difficulty index reflected
a balanced distribution between items that were challenging and those
that were easier for children to perform. Specifically, 98 items
(49%) were classified as neither easy nor difficult, 54 items
(28%) were classified as easy, and 47 items (23%) were
classified as difficult for the children (Table 3).
