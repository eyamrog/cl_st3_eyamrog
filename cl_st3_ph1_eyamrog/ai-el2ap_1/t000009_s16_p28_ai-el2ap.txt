The implementation of this phase was feasible exclusively through the
use of information and communication technologies (ICT). The process of
reviewing research articles inherently involves a digital component, as contemporary
academic publishing is predominantly conducted online. Consequently, all communications among
editors, authors, referees, and editorial board members occur via internet-based
platforms. Accessing these texts requires the use of ICT, not
only due to the geographical dispersion of the authors but
also because the documents themselves are available solely in digital
format.
