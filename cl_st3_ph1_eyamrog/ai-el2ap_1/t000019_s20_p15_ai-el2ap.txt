To ensure the effective integration of Digital Information and Communication
Technologies (DICT) into teaching and learning processes, which are fundamental
to current distance education models, it is essential to address
issues related to access to equipment and internet connectivity both
at school and at home. Additionally, it is important to
consider students’ proficiency in utilizing digital tools not only for
consuming content such as readings and videos, but also for
producing and sharing digital assignments. This enables students to continue
their studies and complete homework regardless of their location. Other
factors, including emotional, familial, and financial circumstances, significantly influence students’
academic experiences, indicating that the flexibility provided by DICT integration,
even when facilitating distance learning, does not inherently ensure academic
success (Costa & Santos, 2017; Costa et al., 2020). Nevertheless,
the present discussion will focus specifically on the physical availability
of technology and the acquisition of relevant technological skills in
both public and domestic settings, with the aim of establishing
conducive conditions for education and study through DICT.
