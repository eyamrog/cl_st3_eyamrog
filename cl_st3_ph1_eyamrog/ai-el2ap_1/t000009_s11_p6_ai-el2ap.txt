CEAP promotes a third main principle: criticism, which emphasizes increased
attention to contextual issues within language classes. This involves addressing
injustices and inequalities present both in the target language context
and in students' current environments (Benesch, 1996). By analyzing and
reflecting on contextual factors that both influence and are influenced
by the target language, Benesch (2009) argues that CEAP can
support students in reconceptualizing their sense of citizenship, personal identities,
and critical thinking about their roles within the target discourse
community. As a result, students may develop the ability not
only to recognize and reproduce the discourse of their peers
but also to identify areas in need of change, as
well as appropriate timing and methods for such change, thereby
contributing to social improvement within the community.
