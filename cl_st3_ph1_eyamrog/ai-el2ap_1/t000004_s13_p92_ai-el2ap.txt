Tiago explained that participants shake hands both before and after
playing as a gesture of respect toward one another. He
emphasized that this practice reflects the non-competitive nature of capoeira,
distinguishing it from other martial arts such as taekwondo, which
are structured around point systems. In contrast, capoeira is characterized
by its emphasis on enjoyment and mutual respect. Tiago also
noted the importance of obtaining permission from those who are
participating in the game. (Interview with Tiago â€“ audio transcription)
