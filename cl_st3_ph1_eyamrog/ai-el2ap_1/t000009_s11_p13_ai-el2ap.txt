For the design of CEAP courses, it is necessary to
broaden the scope of Target Situation Analysis (TSA). As CEAP
addresses not only the linguistic but also the contextual aspects
of both present and target situations, TSA should incorporate methods
for gathering information on the social, political, and ideological characteristics
of the discourse community, which influence and maintain power relations
among its members. In this regard, Benesch (1996) argues for
a critical approach to needs analysis that recognizes the hierarchical
structure of institutions. From a critical perspective, TSA not only
identifies the socio-cognitive demands associated with English use in the
target community but also considers these demands as opportunities for
potential reform. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can play a
significant role in enhancing contextual target situation analysis.
