In response to these challenges, this paper examines how editors,
publishers, and researchers worldwide, with particular attention to the Global
South, have utilized an open source publishing platform to establish
what Altbach described as “an effective scholarly publishing enterprise.” The
scope of this enterprise is analyzed across key dimensions of
scholarly publishing, including country and region, language, discipline, and indexing.
By quantifying contributions from researchers whose work has frequently been
marginalized, this study assesses the extent to which scholarly publishing
in the Global South is decentralizing the traditional locus of
academic production. This development is broadening the conceptualization of “the
literature” across various disciplines, although the full impact and potential
of these contributions for advancing research are only beginning to
be recognized.
