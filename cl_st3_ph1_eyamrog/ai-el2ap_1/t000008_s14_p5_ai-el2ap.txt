Prior to the experiments, two replicates of 15 stored pyrenes
were used to estimate water content following the method described
by Brasil (2009) (see Seed Collection and Benefiting subsection). Pretreatments
involving soaking the pyrenes in water (see Germination of Pretreated
Pyrenes) were applied to the stored pyrenes before conducting germination
tests, and results were compared to a control group of
untreated (non-soaked) stored pyrenes under laboratory conditions. Subsequently, both pretreated
and untreated stored pyrenes were placed to germinate in rolls
of GermitestÂ® paper as previously described.
