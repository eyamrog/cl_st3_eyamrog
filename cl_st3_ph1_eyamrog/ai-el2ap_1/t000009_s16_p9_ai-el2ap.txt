Questionnaires are a commonly used instrument for data collection in
needs analysis conducted by ESP practitioners (Flowerdew & Peacock, 2001).
The integration of information and communication technology (ICT) further enhances
the effectiveness of questionnaires. Online questionnaires can incorporate a range
of digital features, such as charts, figures, and animations, which
may increase respondent engagement and data quality. Additionally, distributing questionnaires
via email allows for repeated dissemination as needed, potentially reduces
response time, and offers participants the flexibility to complete the
survey at their convenience. In the present study, the use
of online questionnaires also facilitated access to participants in geographically
distant locations. The data related to this aspect are presented
in Figure 1.
