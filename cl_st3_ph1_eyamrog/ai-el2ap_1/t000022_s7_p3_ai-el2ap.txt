The increased visibility of the regional scholarly circuit is attributable
to improved flows of scholarly communication facilitated by major indexing
platforms such as Google Scholar, Dimensions, Lens, and the repository
federation LA Referencia, which offers extensive coverage of Latin American
and Caribbean research output. Nevertheless, journals from this region continue
to have limited influence on global science and technology reports
and on the evaluation of scientific careers, projects, and institutions,
where reliance on the Impact Factor and other metrics from
traditional databases such as Web of Science and Scopus remains
predominant. This situation diminishes the perceived value of regionally indexed
journals and incentivizes research groups to prioritize publication in journals
managed by leading international publishers. This preference is reinforced by
longstanding beliefs within the academic community regarding the relevance and
transparency of these established indicators (Martinovich, 2020). The persistence of
this dynamic underscores the disparity between the region’s demonstrated capacity
to produce and disseminate high-quality research and its limited ability
to achieve international recognition for its journals (Packer and Meneghini,
2007). Numerous studies have documented the limitations of traditional bibliometric
indicators, which have been perpetuated by structural factors and have
led to various forms of misuse and distortion, negatively impacting
both scientific creativity and researchers’ attention to the societal relevance
of their work (Guédon, 2011; Gingras, 2016; Ráfols, 2019). Consequently,
internationalization policies driven by the pursuit of higher rankings often
result in reduced institutional autonomy and a diminished capacity to
engage effectively with the local research environment.
