The data indicate that most journals included in the survey
are published by universities. Major public universities, such as Universidad
Nacional Autónoma de México, Universidade de São Paulo, Universidad de
Costa Rica, Universidad de Chile, and Universidad de Buenos Aires,
represent a significant proportion of journal publishers. In Colombia, journal
publishing is notably concentrated within five institutions: Universidad de los
Andes, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Universidad de Antioquia, Pontificia Universidad
Javeriana, and Universidad del Valle. In Cuba, the Editorial de
Ciencias Médicas (ECIMED) stands out as the third largest institutional
publisher by number of journals represented in the OLIVA database.
