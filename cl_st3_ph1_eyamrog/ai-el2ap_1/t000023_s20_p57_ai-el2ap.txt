According to Coesel and Meesters (2007), Cosmarium pseudopyramidatum is morphologically
similar to Cosmarium pyramidatum Brébisson ex Ralfs, but can be
distinguished by the presence of a single pyrenoid per semicell
and a maximum length of up to 60 µm. In
the present survey, only a single specimen of C. pseudopyramidatum
was collected.
