Formal instruction fundamentally transforms cognitive processes and significantly facilitates the
progression from practical to theoretical operations. The importance of schooling
lies not only in the acquisition of new knowledge, but
also in the development of new motivations and formal modes
of verbal, discursive, and logical thinking that are independent of
immediate practical experience (Luria, 2008, pp. 133, 178).
