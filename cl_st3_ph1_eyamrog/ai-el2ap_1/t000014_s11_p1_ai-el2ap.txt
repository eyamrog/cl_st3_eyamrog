This section outlines key considerations regarding the importance and procedures
of archiving language documentation data. It begins with a general
evaluation of the significance of archiving language documentation (§2.1), followed
by an overview of the various types of digital repositories
available (§2.2) and the specific benefits that archiving offers to
language documentation efforts (§2.3). The section also distinguishes digital language
archives from other online platforms (§2.4) and provides guidance on
the appropriate timing and methods for archiving language documentation data
(§2.5). In this article, the term data refers to language
documentation materials, specifically recorded instances and/or observations of spoken or
signed language that can be processed, annotated, and analyzed (see,
for example, Good, 2022). Primary data consist of unprocessed audio
or video recordings or written observations of language, such as
narratives, oral histories, elicitation sessions, conversations, interviews, and experimental protocols.
Secondary data include transcriptions, translations, morphological segmentations, glosses, and other
forms of annotation that require preliminary analysis for their creation
(Kung et al., 2020; Himmelmann, 2012; Thieberger and Berez, 2012).
For comprehensive overviews of language archiving and its historical development,
see Henke and Berez-Kroeker (2016), Berez-Kroeker and Henke (2018), Kaplan
and Lemov (2019), and Kung (2020).
