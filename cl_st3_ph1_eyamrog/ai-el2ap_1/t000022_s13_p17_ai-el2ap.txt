The sustainability of diamond open access journals remains a subject
of debate. The recently published OPERAS report underscores the significance
of this publishing model and estimates that approximately 29,000 diamond
open access journals exist globally. The report also identifies generally
weak management practices as a common characteristic among these journals
and recommends the adoption of a new business model (Bosman
et al., 2021). However, the journals included in SciELO and
Redalyc, most of which do not charge fees for either
reading or publishing, provide evidence to the contrary by demonstrating
structured management and regular operations. In Latin America, there is
broad agreement on the necessity of national and institutional policies
to support the management and continuity of these journals, alongside
a strong consensus that the adoption of the article processing
charge (APC) model is not an appropriate solution (Babini and
Debat, 2020). Additionally, there are well-founded concerns that the APC
model may increase the prevalence of predatory journals and promote
commercialization (Córdoba González, 2021).
