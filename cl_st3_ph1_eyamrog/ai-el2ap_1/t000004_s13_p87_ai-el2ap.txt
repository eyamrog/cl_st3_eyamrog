English was the primary language of instruction in the capoeira
classes observed during the practice phase; however, some brief instructions
were given in Portuguese, such as "rolÃª" (roll), "troca" (change),
and "desce" (go down). Additionally, Sandro used Portuguese when communicating
with participants who were proficient in the language and, on
occasion, addressed the entire group in Portuguese.
