Gesture and ritual constitute significant components of communicative practices in
capoeira. Within the roda, gestures serve essential functions, including signaling
transitions such as the initiation or conclusion of the game,
and demonstrating respect toward the leader and other participants. Certain
gestures adhere to established patterns and exhibit ritualistic characteristics, which
are believed to originate from the Afro-Brazilian religion of Candomblé.
This religious influence is further evident in specific terminology used
in capoeira, such as "bênção" (literally "blessing," referring to a
type of kick) and "batizado" (literally "baptism," denoting a grading
ceremony).
