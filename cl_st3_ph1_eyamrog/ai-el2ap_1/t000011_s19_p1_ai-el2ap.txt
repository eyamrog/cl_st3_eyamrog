Anatomical structure – The stems of Amphilophium curcigerum (L.) L.G.Lohmann
(Bignoniaceae) are slender, with an average diameter of 8.4 mm
(±1.35 mm standard deviation), and exhibit a cylindrical morphology (Figure
1a). These stems possess a cambial variant characterized by xylem
interrupted by phloem wedges (Figure 1b). The secondary xylem contains
wide vessels and broad rays, which are readily observable in
macroscopic transverse sections (Figure 1b). The leaves are slightly asymmetrical
and cordiform, with pinnate venation. The leaf mesophyll is dorsiventral,
comprising two layers of palisade parenchyma and approximately three layers
of lacunose parenchyma (Figures 1c–d).
