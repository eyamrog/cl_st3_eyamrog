The Latin American academic landscape consists of interconnected national academic
communities and regional networks that began to take shape in
the mid-20th century, supported by intergovernmental organizations, cooperation agencies, and
foundations that identified the management of scientific information as essential
for development. This context facilitated the establishment of regional institutions
dedicated to the cataloging and construction of bibliographic indexes, thereby
promoting the dissemination of locally produced scientific knowledge (Rodriguez Garcia
Coord. 2020). By 1967, the creation of information centers such
as BIREME and research networks like CLACSO marked a significant
advancement, as these entities became principal regional repositories for Latin
American scientific output (Packer, 2005; Vessuri, 1994). The professionalization of
scientific publishing was further advanced through the development of indexing
systems led by regional centers affiliated with United Nations agencies
(IMLA-LILACS, DOCPAL, REPIDISCA, AGRINTER-SIDALC) and by major public universities, particularly
the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, which was responsible for
the initial indexes Clase and Periódica, and later Latindex and
BIBLAT. These systems, established and managed by universities and national
or intergovernmental organizations, aimed to enhance the bibliographic exchange of
scientific and technical production within the region. The introduction of
regional open access journal platforms, such as SciELO in 1998
and Redalyc in 2005, provided a digital infrastructure for journals
and indexing web services. Together with Latindex, these platforms implemented
a journal quality certification system emphasizing peer review and editorial
best practices, which contributed to the ongoing professionalization of journals
and established a regional editorial standard characterized by academic quality
and non-commercial open access. Supported by public institutions and government
commitment, these portals and indexing services currently constitute a central
component in the advancement of open science in Latin America
(Vessuri, Cetto and Guédon, 2014; Beigel, 2019; Packer, 2020; Banzato
and Salatino, 2020).
