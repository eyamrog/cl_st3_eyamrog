As shown in Figure 4, 66% of the journals are
edited by universities, approximately 7% by governmental agencies, and 20%
by scientific societies and independent research centers. These data indicate
a predominance of academic and public sector management among journal
publishers. The analysis also identified the proportion of commercial publishers,
with local or national commercial publishers representing 6% and major
commercial publishers accounting for 2.5%. Within the category of local
commercial publishers, journals in medicine and health are the most
prevalent, with ECIMED representing a significant share in this segment.
