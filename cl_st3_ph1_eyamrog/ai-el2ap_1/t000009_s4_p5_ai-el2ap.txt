In Brazil, a large developing country in the early stages
of university internationalization and with limited availability of academic writing
courses, online EAP/CEAP courses may constitute the primary means for
novice researchers to develop academic writing skills. However, designing such
courses presents significant challenges for instructors and course developers due
to social, cultural, ideological, and economic disparities across different regions.
To achieve the level of specificity advocated by ESP pedagogy,
both present and target situation analyses must address contextual factors
related to the discursive practices of the target academic communities
in each region. Conducting these analyses on-site can be both
time-consuming and resource-intensive. Therefore, implementing contextual target situation analysis remotely
emerges as an effective solution to ensure specificity, critical engagement,
and practical relevance in course design, while also reducing costsâ€”a
possibility made feasible by information and communication technologies (ICT).
