To address this question, this study aims to analyze a
selection of articles in which the assessment of preschool children
has been conducted using Luria's theoretical framework, with the objective
of relating these findings to the foundational principles of early
childhood education. The analysis employs Gowin's V methodology, which involves
consideration of four key elements: the research topic, the questions
to be addressed, the relevant concepts, principles, and theories, and
the procedures to be implemented.
