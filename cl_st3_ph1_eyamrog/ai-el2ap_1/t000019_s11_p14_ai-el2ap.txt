The development of dialectical thinking is essential at all stages
of education. Theoretical thinking does not emerge or progress spontaneously
in everyday life; rather, it develops as a result of
instruction that is grounded in a dialectical approach to thought.
Instructional programs based on this framework are characterized by their
developmental impact on learners (Davydov, 1999, pp. 5, 7).
