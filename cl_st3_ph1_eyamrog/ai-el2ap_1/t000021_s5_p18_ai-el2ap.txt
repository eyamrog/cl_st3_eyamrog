Consistent with previous research, avoidance was primarily directed toward colleagues,
superiors, and institutional activities such as research and extension, which
may be attributed to the limited or lack of control
individuals have over these aspects of their work environment (Akbari
et al., 2016; BuriÄ‡ et al., 2016). Teachers generally cannot
avoid classroom responsibilities or interactions with students due to the
inherent requirements of their roles; however, they retain some discretion
in choosing whether to engage with colleagues or participate in
certain institutional activities. Consequently, avoidance may serve as a rationale
for some counterproductive behaviors observed in these contexts.
