Similarly, comparable trends can be identified by examining the relationship
between the countries of authors and the countries of the
journals in which their articles are published (see Figure 7).
The analysis indicates that, for the countries considered, authors predominantly
publish in journals based in their own countries. This pattern
is especially evident among Brazilian authors, with 93.7% of their
articles appearing in Brazilian journals. Chile ranks second, but accounts
for only 1.6% of the total articles. In bibliometric studies
utilizing mainstream indexing sources, this tendency is often interpreted as
academic inbreeding and is typically viewed negatively. In the following
section, an alternative perspective is presented, which challenges the conventional
attribution of national collaboration solely to academic inbreeding. This alternative
is informed by a detailed examination of the substantial number
of articles authored by Brazilians and published in Brazilian journals.
