While archiving is essential for the long-term conservation, preservation, accessibility,
and discoverability of language documentation data, not all data are
equally suitable for archiving or for being archived in the
same manner. Certain materials may be culturally or personally sensitive
to the extent that they should not be archived at
all. Other materials may require restricted access, as discussed in
ยง2.3, limiting engagement to specific individuals. In some cases, such
restrictions may apply differently to various formats of the same
content, such as audio files, video files, or written transcriptions
of a single event. Examples of potentially sensitive material include
esoteric or protected knowledge that is not intended for dissemination
to particular individuals or groups (e.g., community outsiders, members of
other clans, or based on gender), speech that could cause
personal harm, and information that may pose risks to individuals
or communities. Effective language documentation and archiving require open and
ongoing communication among documenters, speakers or signers, and other community
members to ensure that the process is fully ethical and
informed, as further discussed in ยง4.
