In the early twenty-first century, Ezra Ondari-Okemwa, an information science
scholar at Machakos University, identified significant limitations in the regionâ€™s
technological capacity to support electronic knowledge transfer and scholarly publishing,
which were accompanied by a lack of visibility for regional
publications (Ondari-Okemwa, 2007). According to PLOS publisher Alison Muddit, these
conditions require researchers in the Global South to navigate the
challenge of achieving credibility and visibility within the global research
system, often forcing them to choose between supporting local platforms
that address regional needs and conforming to established norms predominantly
set by the Global North (Muddit, 2020; see also Alperin
and Rozemblum, 2017).
