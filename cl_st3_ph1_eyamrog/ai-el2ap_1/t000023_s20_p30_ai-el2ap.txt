The cell is approximately 1.5 times longer than it is
broad, with a pronounced median constriction and a linear sinus.
Semicells are semicircular with undulate margins, exhibiting 6 to 7
undulations per semicell, and have rounded basal angles. The cell
wall is smooth. Each cell contains a single chloroplast and
one pyrenoid per semicell. The cell length is approximately 17
µm, width is approximately 11.4 µm, and isthmus width is
approximately 3.2 µm.
