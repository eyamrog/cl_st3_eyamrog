We hypothesize that opportunism enables species to facultatively engage in
cleaning interactions to acquire additional resources. From this hypothesis, we
derive two predictions. First, we predict that cleaner species will
exhibit greater dietary generalism compared to closely related non-cleaner species
(Fig. 1A). If opportunism is the primary factor influencing cleaning
interactions, species with already generalist diets are expected to incorporate
additional resources, such as mammalian ectoparasites and damaged fleshy tissues,
into their diets. Second, we predict that opportunistic species will
interact with a greater number of mammalian hosts, including those
hosts that are most frequently utilized by other cleaning species,
thereby occupying central positions within the interaction network (Fig. 1B).
We test these predictions using two continent-level networks that document
the natural history of cleaning interactions between birds and mammalian
hosts in Africa and South America (Sazima et al. 2012;
Mikula et al. 2017).
