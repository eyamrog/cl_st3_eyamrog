Interviews with football club organizers and managers provided insight into
the extent of organization required for club operations. Most individuals
in leadership positions demonstrated a reasonable level of English proficiency
and possessed substantial knowledge of UK practices related to fundraising,
scheduling, and the organization of sports events in Northern Ireland.
Their responsibilities included securing funding for both the team and
tournaments, booking pitches, hiring Irish referees, and arranging local sponsorship.
For example, a local law firm sponsored Ramkabian, while a
taxi company in Cookstown sponsored Fitun Unidade. These sponsorships supported
the purchase of football shirts and jackets for players, as
well as medals and trophies for tournaments. Additionally, two members
of the Lao Rai club had previously played for the
national team of Timor-Leste prior to migrating to Northern Ireland,
contributing professional experience to the clubâ€™s organizational activities.
