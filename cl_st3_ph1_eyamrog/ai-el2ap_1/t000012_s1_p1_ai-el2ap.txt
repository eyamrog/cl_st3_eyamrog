Cleaning interactions are interspecific associations in which cleaner species obtain
benefits from host species by consuming parasites, injured tissues, or
blood. Globally, a diverse array of bird species engage in
cleaning behaviors directed toward large mammals. In this study, we
investigated the factors influencing the structure of networks formed by
cleaning birds and their mammalian hosts. We analyzed two cleaner-host
networks, one from Brazilian openlands and another from African openlands,
to examine the relationship between dietary generalism and cleaning behavior.
We hypothesized that cleaning interactions are predominantly opportunistic, leading to
the expectation that generalist species constitute the primary components of
cleaner-host networks. To test this, we compared the diet diversity
of cleaner species with that of their closely related, non-cleaning
counterparts. In 18 out of 26 bird families, cleaner species
exhibited greater diet diversity than their non-cleaning relatives. We further
assessed whether birds with more diverse diets occupy more central
positions within cleaner-host networks. The results indicate no significant correlation
between species centrality in the networks and their diet diversity.
These findings suggest that while dietary generalism may enable opportunistic
species to participate in cleaning interactions, the prominence of a
cleaner species within the network is likely influenced by additional
factors, such as abundance and behavioral traits related to cleaning.
More broadly, our results indicate that the traits facilitating species
participation in ecological networks may differ from those determining their
functional roles within these networks.
