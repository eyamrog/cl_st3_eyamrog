The focus groups were conducted in four phases (Figure 1):
(I) presentation of the research objectives and completion of the
Informed Consent Form; (II) presentation of the identified emotional work
demands, which were organized into three categories: (a) interactional demands,
arising from relationships with students, colleagues, and managers; (b) technical-pedagogical
demands, related to teaching practices; and (c) intrapersonal demands, resulting
from internal conflicts and dissonances (Morais, Gondim, & Palma, 2020);
(III) introduction of guiding questions regarding which emotions are elicited
by specific emotional demands and the strategies teachers use to
manage these demands; and (IV) group discussion aimed at reaching
consensus, identifying disagreements, and further exploring the topic. Each type
of emotional demand (interactional, technical-pedagogical, and intrapersonal) was addressed separately,
with the guiding questions presented in sequence.
