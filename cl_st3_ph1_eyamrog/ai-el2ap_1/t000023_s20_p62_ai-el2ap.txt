The cell is 1.2 to 1.3 times longer than broad,
with a deep median constriction and a linear sinus. Each
semicell is trapezoidal with a truncate apex and rounded basal
angles. The cell wall is smooth. There is one chloroplast
per cell, with one pyrenoid present in each semicell. Cell
length ranges from 17.8 to 28.1 µm, width from 13.2
to 21.1 µm, and isthmus width from 7.6 to 5
µm.
