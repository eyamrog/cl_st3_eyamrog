Third, the case of Timorese migrants in Northern Ireland illustrates
the analytical utility of the concept of trajectory. This approach
highlights two key processes: first, the interaction between educational backgrounds
and migration trajectories in shaping migrantsâ€™ communicative repertoires, language resources,
and funds of knowledge; and second, the ways in which
individual migrants possessing linguistic repertoires and resources that are highly
valued in the local linguistic market are able to assume
leadership roles within the community, particularly in the formation of
local communities of practice and the organization of social activities
such as football.
