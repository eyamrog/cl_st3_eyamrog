Among journals that charge article processing charges (APCs), 38% are
managed by scientific societies, 37% by universities, 13% by major
commercial publishers, 7% by governmental organizations, and 5% by small
commercial publishers. The adoption of APCs by many journals managed
by the academic community raises questions regarding the sustainability of
these journals and their varying levels of institutionalization. Córdoba González
(2021) notes that Latin American journals with APCs generally set
relatively low fees, a trend also observed in the journals
included in the OLIVA database. This suggests that these journals
implement APCs primarily to cover the costs associated with editorial
processes and peer review management, which are not otherwise funded
by their institutions. Journals indexed in SciELO and Redalyc are
subject to specific cataloging, evaluation, and digitization procedures that require
both material and human resources. While these resources are typically
provided by the publishing institutions, some journals use APCs to
finance expenses such as DOI registration, translation services, and administrative
or technical support. This approach differs from the business model
employed by commercial journals. Additionally, journals in the region that
charge high APCs comparable to those in the mainstream publishing
industry are rare.
