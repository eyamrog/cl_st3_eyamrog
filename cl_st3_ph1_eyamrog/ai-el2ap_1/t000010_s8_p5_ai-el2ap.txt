Limited neuropsychological research in child populations indicates that children's performance
can vary significantly according to cultural, educational, and socioeconomic factors;
specifically, existing findings have identified differences in cognitive and socioemotional
development among preschool-aged children (Lohndorf et al., 2019). However, Porto
et al. (2021) and Rea-Sandin and Causadias (2021) report that
variability is particularly pronounced in executive functions, with parental educational
level identified as a significant contributing factor.
