A reliable digital repository implements an active strategy for the
long-term preservation of digital media files and their associated metadata.
The Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC) defines digital preservation as a
series of managed activities required to ensure continued access to
digital materials for as long as necessary, encompassing all actions
needed to maintain access beyond the limitations imposed by media
failure or technological and organizational change (DPC, 2015). Long-term preservation
is characterized by the sustained accessibility of digital materials, or
at least the information they contain, for an indefinite period.
Digital preservation extends beyond simple file backup; it involves the
migration of data and metadata across different formats and software
systems as technology evolves, the implementation of accurate redundancy through
the storage of duplicate copies on various media types and
in multiple locations, and the regular monitoring of file integrity
across all storage sites. As noted by Owens (2018, p.
5), preservation is an ongoing process that requires continuous human
effort and resource allocation, and it cannot be regarded as
a one-time expenditure.
