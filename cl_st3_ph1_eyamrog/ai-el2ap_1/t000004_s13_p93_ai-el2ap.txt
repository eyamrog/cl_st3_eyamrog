Other forms of gestural communication are used to signal transitions
within the roda. In addition to entering the roda through
the space in front of the leader, as previously described,
a capoeirista may also "buy" the game. This process involves
any participant standing in the roda replacing one of the
current players by signaling their intention to join; this is
done by extending a hand toward the center of the
roda with the palm facing the player they wish to
engage. This method of entering the game is more commonly
observed in dynamic rodas. Such gestures are integral to establishing
the sequence of participation within the roda, demonstrating mutual respect
among participants, and constitute an important aspect of the linguistic
and cultural competencies developed through capoeira practice.
