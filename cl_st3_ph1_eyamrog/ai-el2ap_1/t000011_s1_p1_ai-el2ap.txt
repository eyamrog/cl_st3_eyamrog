Lianas are woody climbers whose stems and leaves are subject
to various environmental pressures, including mechanical damage and dehydration. The
resistance of plant tissues to damage can be biomechanically assessed
through measurements of stiffness, bending, and toughness. Although the relationship
between physical resistance and tissue moisture content is well established
in woody plants, it remains unclear and has not been
systematically investigated in lianas. In this study, the effects of
dehydration on stem bending stiffness and leaf fracture toughness were
experimentally evaluated in Amphilophium crucigerum (Bignoniaceae). Ten stem and leaf
samples were collected and assigned to two conditions: (i) samples
maintained in a moist state and (ii) samples subjected to
gradual dehydration through air exposure. Structural Youngâ€™s modulus in stems
and fracture toughness in leaves were measured at 4-hour intervals
over a 48-hour period for both conditions. Results indicated that
samples undergoing gradual dehydration exhibited increased stem bending stiffness and
leaf fracture toughness, whereas samples kept moist showed no significant
changes in these biomechanical properties throughout the experiment. These findings
demonstrate that tissue moisture content is a critical factor influencing
the biomechanical properties of liana stems and leaves, and should
be carefully considered in related assessments.
