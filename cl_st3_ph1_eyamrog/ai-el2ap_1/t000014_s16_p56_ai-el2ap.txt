Files in ELAN contain a minimum of three annotation tiers:
transcription, translation, and notes. More detailed information regarding the glosses
of Paresi or English morphemes (i.e., interlinearization) is managed in
the FLEx program, which enables the automatic insertion of glosses
once they have been entered into the database, a feature
not available in ELAN. Neither language possesses a standardized orthography
that is consistently used in indigenous schools. Consequently, transcriptions were
produced using the orthographies familiar to the speakers, and for
Paresi, these were further systematized according to the orthographic conventions
proposed by Brand√£o.
