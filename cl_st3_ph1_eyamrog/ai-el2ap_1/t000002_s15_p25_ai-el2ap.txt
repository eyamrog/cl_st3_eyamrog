One of the strengths of sociocultural discourse analysis is that
the actual talk remains the primary data throughout the analysis,
allowing for detailed examination of the processes involved in the
joint construction of knowledge (Mercer, 2004, p. 143). In this
approach, the emphasis is placed not on the discursive functions
or the language itself, but rather on the content of
the talk and the collaborative pursuit of intellectual activity (Mercer,
2004). This method employs an inductive approach to inquiry, whereby
themes or categories are expected to emerge directly from the
data (Evans, 2013; Taber, 2013).
