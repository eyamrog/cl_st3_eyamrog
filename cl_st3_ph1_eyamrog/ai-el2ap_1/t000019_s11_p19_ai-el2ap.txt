The trend toward increased digitalization in Brazil has intensified since
the late 1990s. This development is not the result of
a natural progression but is instead attributable to political and
economic decisions that reflect Brazilâ€™s intention to participate in a
globalized context (Enders, 2004; Akkari, 2011). The process was further
accelerated by the implementation of social distancing measures during the
Covid-19 pandemic, which aligned with and expedited existing government initiatives.
