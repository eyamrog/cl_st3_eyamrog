In the revised version, the subtest assessing quantity comparison, which
demonstrated a ceiling effect due to its low difficulty for
children, was removed and replaced with a counting quantities subtest.
This new subtest incorporates two numerical cognitive processing skills that
are considered essential for children's academic development during the first
three years of schooling: enumeration and quantity comparison (Canto-LÃ³pez et
al., 2019).
