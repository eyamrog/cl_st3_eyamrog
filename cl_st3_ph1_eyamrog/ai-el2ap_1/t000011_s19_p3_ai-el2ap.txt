On average, the fracture toughness of leaf lamina maintained in
a moist condition remains statistically unchanged over time (Fdf(59) =
1.71; P = 0.19; figure 2d), with a mean value
of approximately 206 ± 53 J m−2 and a median
of 197 J m−2. In contrast, leaves subjected to gradual
dehydration exhibit a significant increase in fracture toughness over time
(Fdf(59) = 12.57; P < 0.001; figure 2e; Supplementary material
table S4). Additionally, the relative water content of leaves undergoing
gradual dehydration decreases exponentially with time (Fdf(59) = 208; P
< 0.001; figure 2f; Supplementary material table S5), and leaf
fracture toughness demonstrates a negative exponential relationship with stem relative
water content (Fdf(59) = 9.35; P = 0.003; figure 3b;
Supplementary material table S6). For instance, at a moisture content
of 12%, the average fracture toughness of A. crucigerum leaf
lamina is 270 J m−2, whereas at 24% moisture content,
the average fracture toughness is 230 J m−2, representing a
15% reduction.
