According to the ICT Education 2018 report (CGI.br, 2019b), young
people's ability to use the Internet is strongly associated with
self-directed learning experiences. The study found that 80% of students
in both public and private schools in Brazil acquired their
Internet skills independently, suggesting that their learning is primarily oriented
toward basic, widely shared knowledge. Furthermore, the report highlights the
persistence of inequalities between schools, both in terms of technology
use and in the broader conditions of access to education
(CGI.br, 2019b, p. 116).
