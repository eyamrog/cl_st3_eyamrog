Facilitating access to language documentation materials may necessitate innovative approaches.
One effective model is the "distributed digital audiovisual archive" or
"jukebox archive" (Barwick, 2004; Barwick et al., 2005; O’Meara and
González Guadarrama, 2016). Initially implemented in Australia, this model involves
installing a computer in a community center or other accessible,
neutral location, allowing community members to access materials without requiring
an internet connection. The jukebox computer stores language documentation resources—including
audio and video recordings, transcriptions, photographs, and other relevant files—in
widely compatible formats such as .mp3. It also provides options
for users to copy materials onto CDs, DVDs, flash drives,
phones, or .mp3 players. Community members are able to take
copies of these materials for personal use and may also
contribute their own content to the archive. An alternative approach
utilizes a local Wi-Fi transmitter, such as a Raspberry Pi,
which is particularly effective in settings where individuals possess smartphones
and the necessary digital skills but have limited or no
computer literacy (e.g., Thieberger, 2019).
