All Lindsaea species from Viçosa share the characteristics of having
2-pinnate laminae and dimidiate pinnules. Lindsaea lancea var. lancea is
distinguished from the other two taxa by the presence of
continuous sori, while L. quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis is characterized by
reddish-brown, winged rachises. In contrast, L. stricta var. stricta can
be identified by its petioles, which are terete on the
abaxial surface. Additionally, pinnule length varies among the three taxa:
L. lancea var. lancea has pinnules measuring 1.5–2 cm, L.
quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis has pinnules measuring 1.2–1.5 cm, and L.
stricta var. stricta has pinnules up to 1 cm in
length.
