Sandro facilitates the group's engagement with both Portuguese language and
capoeira practice, placing particular emphasis on the historical and cultural
aspects of capoeira. His introduction to capoeira occurred under challenging
circumstances; he began learning the discipline during his early adolescence
after experiencing bullying at his school in Paran√°, where he
was the only overweight Black student. While working as a
street ice cream vendor, he observed an informal group of
youths practicing capoeira and, upon approaching them, was invited to
join their training sessions.
