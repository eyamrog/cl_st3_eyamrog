The practice of capoeira, while offering exposure to the Portuguese
language through music, commands, and social interaction, is unlikely to
be sufficient on its own for achieving full fluency in
Portuguese. Although participation in capoeira can enhance listening comprehension and
vocabulary acquisition related to the context of the art form,
it typically does not provide systematic instruction in grammar, reading,
or writing skills, nor does it cover the breadth of
vocabulary and communicative functions required for general language proficiency. Therefore,
while capoeira can be a valuable supplementary resource for language
learners, additional structured language study is generally necessary to attain
comprehensive fluency in Portuguese.
