The deductive and inductive analysis of the data resulted in
the development of a categorical system of teacher emotional regulation,
as illustrated in Figure 2. The identified emotional regulation strategies
corresponded to the five strategy families outlined in the Process
Model of Emotion Regulation. Table 2 provides definitions of the
strategies, their subdivision into specific tactics, the general frequency of
each family and strategy, and representative examples. The detailed breakdown
of strategies into tactics facilitated a more precise characterization of
emotional regulation within the investigated context and highlighted its specific
features. Additionally, this approach enabled meaningful group comparisons. A more
general analysis would likely have obscured these findings.
