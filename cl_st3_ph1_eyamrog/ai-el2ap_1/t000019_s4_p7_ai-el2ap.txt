The BNCC addresses the use of information and communication technologies
(ICT) in a manner that does not fully consider the
realities of Brazilian schools and households. However, it also formalizes
public interest and establishes a legal framework that can facilitate
investments and related changes necessary to achieve its stated objectives.
Therefore, it is essential for public agencies to define and
implement requirements for investments in schools, teacher training, and the
provision of specific access packages for students in public school
households.
