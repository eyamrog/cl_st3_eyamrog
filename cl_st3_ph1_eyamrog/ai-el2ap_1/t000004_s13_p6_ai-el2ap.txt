The origin of the word "capoeira" remains uncertain. It is
commonly hypothesized that the term derives from the indigenous Tupi
word "caa-apuamera," which refers to a young forest growing in
an area that had previously been cleared. Such locations are
believed to have served as sites where runaway slaves practiced
combat techniques and ambushed individuals sent by slave owners to
recapture them. However, there is insufficient evidence to conclusively support
this etymological theory (de Abreu, 2005).
