Capoeira is commonly described as a game (jogo in Portuguese)
and is therefore played rather than fought. Participants form a
circle, known as a roda in Portuguese, which also refers
to the social gathering where capoeira takes place. The game
is accompanied by music performed by an ensemble called the
bateria, which is positioned at the edge of the circle,
with the musicians seated on chairs or a bench.
