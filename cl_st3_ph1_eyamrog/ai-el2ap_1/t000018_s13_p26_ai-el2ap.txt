According to Luria, the neuropsychologist should identify the primary deficit
through a comprehensive interview that examines the subject’s life, including
habits, skills, knowledge, and lifestyle. Simultaneously, Luria recommends administering simple
tasks to objectively verify the subject’s self-reported information. For instance,
the examiner may instruct the subject to perform an action
such as, “With your right hand, touch your left ear.”
This approach allows the examiner to assess the subject’s ability
to understand and execute verbal commands, relying on neuropsychological functions
such as verbal retention and the programming and control of
conscious actions. Additionally, it is important to evaluate other factors,
including whether the correct hand was selected and whether it
was properly oriented in space, which involves assessing visuospatial organization,
sequential motor organization, and the programming and control of the
motor act.
