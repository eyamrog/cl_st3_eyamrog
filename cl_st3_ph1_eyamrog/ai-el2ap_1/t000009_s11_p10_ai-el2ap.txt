Target situation analysis (TSA) is a key component of needs
analysis in the design of courses for English for Academic
Purposes (CEAP). TSA involves identifying the specific knowledge and skills
that learners require to function effectively in their target academic
contexts (Songhori, 2008). As a procedure within ESP/CEAP pedagogy, TSA
enables instructors to ensure the specificity of course content by
analyzing how language is used within the relevant discourse community,
thereby facilitating the translation of studentsâ€™ needs into appropriate linguistic,
literacy, and pedagogical tasks.
