This study aimed to investigate teachers' emotions and emotion regulation
strategies in response to the diverse emotional demands encountered in
the classroom. The research contributes to the field by introducing
a contextual framework for teachers' emotion regulation, extending beyond previous
qualitative studies that primarily addressed intrapersonal factors. Methodologically, the study
is innovative in its use of focus groups and comparative
analysis across different participant groups to identify individual differences in
regulation strategies. Furthermore, by delineating categories of regulation strategies, the
study provides practical guidance for teachers regarding the implementation of
these strategies and increases their awareness of the potential advantages
and disadvantages associated with specific approaches. The findings suggest that
acquiring a range of emotion regulation strategies may enhance teachers'
emotional flexibility, thereby supporting more adaptive and effective emotion regulation
in professional contexts.
