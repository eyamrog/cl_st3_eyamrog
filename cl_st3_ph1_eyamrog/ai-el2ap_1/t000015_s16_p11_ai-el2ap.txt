To evaluate the research coverage of JUOJS, the titles and
abstracts of the five most recent articles published in ISSN-verified
journals were concatenated and processed using a neural field of
study classifier trained on English-language data (Weber et al., 2020).
As the classifier operates on English text, all titles and
abstracts were translated into English using the Ubiquitous Knowledge Project’s
EasyNMT. The classifier produces a probability distribution across all possible
fields, enabling multidisciplinary classification; however, for reporting purposes, each journal
was assigned the single most probable field of study label
based on the Australian and New Zealand Standard Research Classification
(ANZSRC). The ANZSRC schema was selected due to its alignment
with the dataset used to train the classifier, in which
examples were labeled according to ANZSRC (Weber et al., 2020).
While ANZSRC fields correspond to the OECD’s Fields of Science
and Technology (FOS), they differ from the categories used by
the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) seven research area directorates, with
the most significant discrepancies occurring in STEM disciplines, particularly the
pure sciences. The classifier addresses these differences by assigning general
labels such as Chemical and Physical Sciences, which can then
be mapped to the broader research fields defined by the
NSF classification.
