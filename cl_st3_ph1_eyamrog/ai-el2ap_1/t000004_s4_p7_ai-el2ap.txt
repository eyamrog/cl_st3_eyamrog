This paper began by referencing the metaphor of “language learning
in the wild.” However, it is necessary to question whether
capoeira truly constitutes a “wild” environment. Historically, capoeira emerged as
a space of freedom and resistance on the margins of
a repressive, slave-owning society. Nevertheless, an examination of capoeira as
a practice reveals that it is highly structured and organized.
Movements are regulated by rhythm, and the songs and sayings
are embedded with complex cultural meanings that may not be
immediately accessible, even to some Brazilians. As Sandro noted, the
practice is guided by fundamentos—cultural values that define capoeira. Anthropological
and sociological research has demonstrated that practices which may appear
chaotic or “primitive” to outsiders often possess sophisticated internal order,
and capoeira exemplifies this phenomenon. Despite its reputation, capoeira is
not “wild”; rather, practitioners are systematically apprenticed into, and embody,
intricate and historically grounded logics of practice. Consequently, we argue
that systematized language learning, conceptualized as processes of enregisterment following
Agha, can be effectively integrated into diasporic capoeira classes, and
that capoeira can contribute to language and culture learning in
mainstream Portuguese programs. From this perspective, Capoeira as an Additional
Language encompasses more than linguistic acquisition; it involves the mastery
of a register organized as an assemblage of verbal, visual,
and embodied elements. Thus, the process undertaken by novice capoeiristas
is fundamentally a process of enregisterment.
