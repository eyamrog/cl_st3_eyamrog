Mooring and remooring processes entail significant agency on the part
of the social actors involved. In the context of labour
migration, these processes encompass not only securing accommodation and employment
but also identifying and establishing spaces for recreational activities linked
to the migrantsâ€™ place of origin, as well as determining
the organization and responsible parties for such activities. In the
case of remooring, these social processes are inherently iterative.
