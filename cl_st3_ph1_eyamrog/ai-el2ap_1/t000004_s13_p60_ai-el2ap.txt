Social interaction constitutes an integral component of capoeira practice. In
Brazil, capoeira rodas frequently conclude with the performance of samba
de roda. Similarly, both capoeira workshops and several of the
classes observed in this study ended with social gatherings, typically
held in a bar or at a studentâ€™s residence. During
these events, topics related to capoeira, African and Brazilian culture
are commonly discussed, and the Portuguese language is often used,
providing additional opportunities for students to enhance their cultural and
linguistic knowledge. These interactions also facilitate the development of interpersonal
relationships among students, thereby contributing to the cohesion and supportive
atmosphere within the capoeira school.
