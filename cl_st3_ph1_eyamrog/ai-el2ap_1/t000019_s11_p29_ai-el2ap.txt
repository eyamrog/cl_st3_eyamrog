Given that more than 81% of Brazilian students in basic
education are enrolled in public schools, including municipal, state, and
federal institutions (INEP, 2019), it is essential that Information and
Communication Technology (ICT) education is incorporated into the curriculum at
this level. Ensuring the inclusion of ICT in public schools
is particularly important, as these institutions constitute the primary educational
environment for the majority of Brazilian students.
