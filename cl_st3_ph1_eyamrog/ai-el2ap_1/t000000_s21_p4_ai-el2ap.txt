Rhizomes are short to long-creeping and may be glabrous or
bear catenate hairs. Leaves are large, reaching up to 4
m in length, with laminae that are 2- to 4-pinnate
and possess free veins. The indumentum consists of catenate hairs,
acicular hairs, or may be absent. Sori are marginal, discrete,
and located at the tips of single veins. The inner
and outer indusia are fused, forming purse-shaped, cup-shaped, or hemi-globose
structures (Smith et al. 2006).
