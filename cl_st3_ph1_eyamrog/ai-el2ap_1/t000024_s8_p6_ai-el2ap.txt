In Brazil, the bromeliad Aechmea distichantha Lem. is found in
the Cerrado and Atlantic Rainforest biomes within the states of
Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Paraná,
Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul, and Mato Grosso do
Sul (Forzza et al. 2010; Faria et al. 2022). Wittrockia
cyathiformis (Vell.) Leme is distributed in the Atlantic Rainforest from
Minas Gerais to Santa Catarina, at elevations ranging from 750
to 1,900 meters (Wanderley et al. 2007). Both species exhibit
a facultative growth habit and are pollinated by birds (Cestari
2009). Aechmea distichantha has been classified as vulnerable (Martinelli et
al. 2008) and of least concern (Faria et al. 2022),
while W. cyathiformis is considered endemic (Martinelli et al. 2008;
Tardivo 2022). A. distichantha flowers throughout the year, whereas W.
cyathiformis has a flowering period from April to June and
from August to December (Wanderley et al. 2007). Individuals of
both species were collected during deforestation associated with the construction
of the Mário Covas Highway in São Paulo, Brazil, which
began in 2013.
