The objective of this study was to assess the psychometric
properties of the revised PreAcademic Battery (B-PREA-R) for Cuban preschool
children. The battery was administered to a sample of 300
children aged four to six years in Cienfuegos, Cuba. Item
analysis indicated that, among the 199 items, 61 were classified
as high quality, 132 as good quality, and 6 as
regular quality. The internal consistency of the battery was adequate,
with a Cronbach's alpha of .85. Factor analysis identified three
factors: Factor 1, "Executive Skills," included the subtests of visual
selective attention, matrices, story comprehension, graphomotor skills, and quantity counting;
Factor 2, "Memory Skills," consisted of the visual working memory
subtest; and Factor 3, "Linguistic Skills," comprised the vocabulary, verbal
working memory, and repeating syllables subtests. The use of quartile-based
groupings for the three age groups (4, 5, and 6
years) enables the assessment of the development of executive, linguistic,
and memory skills in preschool children. The B-PREA-R is a
brief and easily administered instrument suitable for educational settings, and
it demonstrates adequate psychometric properties for evaluating neurocognitive development in
the preschool period, identifying children's strengths and weaknesses, and informing
their preparation for entry into primary education.
