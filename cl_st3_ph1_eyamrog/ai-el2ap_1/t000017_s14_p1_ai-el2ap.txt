The study sample consisted of 300 preschool children aged between
46 and 82 months (4 to 6 years), comprising 100
children aged 46 to 58 months (pre-kindergarten), 100 aged 60
to 70 months (kindergarten), and 100 aged 72 to 82
months (first grade, as defined in Cuba). The sample included
both sexes (54% boys and 46% girls) and was drawn
from three educational institutions in the city of Cienfuegos, Cuba.
These institutions were selected based on their enrollment of more
than 150 children and their representation of different areas within
the province.
