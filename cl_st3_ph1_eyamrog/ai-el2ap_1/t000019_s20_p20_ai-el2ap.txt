Regarding home access, although quantitative data indicate that 67% of
the Brazilian population over the age of 10 has internet
access and more than 95% possess cell phones (CGI.br, 2018a,
2019a), further analysis is required to identify existing limitations and
to determine the extent of investment still necessary, particularly for
lower socioeconomic groups who may depend on digital environments for
distance learning. Among households with internet access, 56% rely primarily
on mobile phones, and only 28% have access to streaming
services (Idem). These figures suggest that internet access is often
limited and shared among family members, both in terms of
bandwidth and available devices, and that mobile phones alone are
generally inadequate for educational purposes.
