Europeans were generally unwilling to migrate across the Atlantic in
significant numbers to serve as inexpensive labor. Consequently, the Portuguese
relied on the local indigenous population for forced labor and
began importing enslaved individuals from the African continent, primarily from
West Central Africa (SLAVE VOYAGES, 2021). Over time, African slaves
increasingly replaced the indigenous labor force, which had also been
subjected to enslavement, particularly after substantial declines in the indigenous
population due to epidemics (MARQUESE, 2006). Although it is challenging
to determine the precise number of Africans transported to Brazil
during the approximately three centuries of the transatlantic slave trade,
which ended with the abolition of slavery in 1888, estimates
suggest that around six million people were brought to Brazil
(SLAVE VOYAGES, 2021).
