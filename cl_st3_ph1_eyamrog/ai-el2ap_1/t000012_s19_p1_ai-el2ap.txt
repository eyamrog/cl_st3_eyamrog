The mean diversity of cleaners was higher than that of
non-cleaners in most families. In 18 out of the 26
families analyzed in Brazil and Africa, the mean diversity was
significantly greater for cleaners (Fig. 3). For instance, in the
Charadriidae family, the mean H value was approximately 0.268 for
non-cleaners, which constitute about 93% of the family members, whereas
for cleaners, which represent about 6% of the members, the
mean H value was approximately 1.265.
