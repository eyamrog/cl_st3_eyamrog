Previous research on journals using Open Journal Systems (JUOJS) identified
9,828 such journals in 2015 (Alperin, Stranack, & Garnett, 2016).
A survey of 2,114 JUOJS staff members indicated that 97.8%
of these journals were open access (OA), with 13.6% employing
Article Processing Charges (APCs) to support OA (Alperin, Stranack, &
Hanson, 2017; see also Edgar & Willinsky, 2010). These findings
imply that 84.2% of JUOJS operate as “OA diamond” journals,
meaning they do not charge either authors or readers. In
comparison, a more recent study estimated that JUOJS constitute 60%
of OA diamond journals, within a total of at least
17,000 and possibly up to 29,000 OA diamond journals (Bosman
et al., 2021, p. 93). Regarding indexing, Bosman et al.
(2021) observed that despite their integration into academic structures, OA
diamond journals face challenges in achieving proper inclusion within the
broader scholarly publishing ecosystem (p. 84).
