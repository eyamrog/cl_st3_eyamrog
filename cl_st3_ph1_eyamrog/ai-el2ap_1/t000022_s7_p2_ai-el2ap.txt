The global report on diamond journals by Bosman et al.
(2021), published by OPERAS, highlights the significance of journals that
do not charge fees for publishing or access, and underscores
the contribution of Latin America, which accounts for 25% of
these publications worldwide. These open access journals are predominantly published
by universities and managed by full-time faculty members, with technical
support typically provided by centralized library teams. A key factor
in the development of university publishing in this region is
the widespread adoption of the open source Open Journal System
(OJS-PKP) for managing editorial processes, peer review, and publication. In
addition to university-affiliated journals, scientific societies and professional associations also
publish journals, often utilizing university infrastructure and personnel for tasks
such as digitization, permalink creation, DOI acquisition, and XML markup.
While further strengthening of this support is necessary, the existing
institutional and governmental backing has been instrumental in the establishment
and expansion of journals in Latin America and the Caribbean.
