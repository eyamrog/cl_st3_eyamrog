Consistent with the findings of Burić et al. (2016), teachers
in the present study reported experiencing a broad spectrum of
emotions with considerable intensity during teaching, student interactions, and classroom
management. Notably, teachers tended to focus more on negative emotions,
reflecting their efforts to regulate these affective responses. Anger and
sadness emerged as the most prominent primary emotions, primarily associated
with interactional challenges such as student misbehavior and relationships with
colleagues or supervisors, which aligns with previous research (Burić et
al., 2016; Chang & Davis, 2009; Taxer & Gross, 2018).
Technical and pedagogical demands were also found to elicit negative
emotions, though these were generally less intense and included feelings
such as frustration, worry, compassion, helplessness, and anguish. Furthermore, teachers
reported regulating frustration that stemmed from intrapersonal demands, including internal
conflicts and dissatisfaction. The findings of Taxer and Frenzel (2015)
indicate that the authentic expression of negative emotions is associated
with impaired teacher-student relationships and increased emotional exhaustion, highlighting the
critical role of emotion regulation in the teaching profession.
