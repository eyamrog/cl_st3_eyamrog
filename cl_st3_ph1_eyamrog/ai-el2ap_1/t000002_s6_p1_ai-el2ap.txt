This paper examines two research paradigms and their association with
methodological approaches for analyzing educational dialogue: systematic coding, which aligns
with positivist and quantitative traditions, and sociocultural discourse analysis, which
aligns with interpretivist and qualitative traditions. The systematic coding approach
utilizes a coding scheme in which utterances are assigned to
predefined categories that can be further refined or expanded as
needed. According to Hennessy et al. (2020), frequency counting offers
several advantages, including the ability to process large volumes of
data, identify key markers, efficiently search datasets to determine correlations
between specific acts, detect patterns, measure changes in practice, and
facilitate comparisons that can be subjected to statistical analysis.
