When performing a song, it is important to establish a
foundation and convey a clear message to the audience. Many
people today are challenged by the meanings embedded in songs
performed by singers, and often do not fully understand them.
For example, if I sing a song to you and
you do not pay attention to its content, you may
miss important information or warnings. In the context of the
roda, if I subsequently take an action such as kicking
you, you might question why this occurred. However, the song
may have contained a warning about this action, which you
overlooked by not listening carefully. An illustrative example is the
song that includes the lyrics, “valha me Deus, Senhor São
Bento, buraco velho tem cobra dentro.” This translates to “God
help me, Saint Benedict, the old hole has a snake
inside.” In this context, “valha me Deus” is a plea
for protection, and Saint Benedict is invoked as a protector
against snake bites, which metaphorically refers to potential attacks from
other capoeiristas. The phrase “buraco velho tem cobra dentro” serves
as a warning that an experienced player may be present
in the roda, and that caution is advised when engaging
with them, as it could be dangerous. (Interview with Sandro
