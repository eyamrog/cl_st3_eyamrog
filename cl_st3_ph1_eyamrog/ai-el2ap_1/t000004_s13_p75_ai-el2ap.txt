On certain occasions, verbal communication interrupts the continuity of movement,
typically as a form of repair. For example, during one
instance, Sophie executes a kick that she believes has made
contact with Mestre João. She subsequently apologizes both verbally and
with a conventional gesture that is not specific to capoeira.
Following this, she extends her hand to invite him to
perform a volta ao mundo, after which they both crouch
at the pé do berimbau to initiate a new game.
