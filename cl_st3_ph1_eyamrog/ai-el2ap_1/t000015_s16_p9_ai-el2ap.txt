English hegemony in scholarly communication is increasingly being challenged by
the concept of “bibliodiversity,” which Monica Berger (2021) of the
New York City College of Technology identifies as central to
the decolonization of the open access (OA) movement (see also
Shearer, 2019). In response to concerns regarding language use in
research, Federico Navarro of La Universidad de O'Higgins, along with
eleven other international scholars, issued a position statement that critically
examines the assumption of English as a “lingua franca” in
scientific and academic contexts. This statement highlights the negative impacts
of English dominance on knowledge production and advocates for the
use of multiple languages and varieties to foster transnational dialogue
within scientific and academic communities (Navarro et al., 2022). Similarly,
Suresh Canagarajah of Penn State University argues that increased bibliodiversity
can contribute to the gradual reduction of power imbalances and
support the decolonization of academic writing and scholarship, complementing broader
efforts toward institutional and policy reform (Canagarajah, 2022, p. 20).
The international support for such changes is further evidenced by
the diverse signatories of the 2019 Helsinki Initiative on Multilingualism.
