While the differences between groups are significant, the similarities also
warrant analysis. In both groups, age, sex, urbanicity, and the
educational model (Cuban program in preschool education) were controlled, indicating
that these variables do not account for the observed neuropsychological
variability between the groups. Additionally, no significant differences were found
between the groups in right-left orientation, similarity and difference tasks,
or manual laterality.
