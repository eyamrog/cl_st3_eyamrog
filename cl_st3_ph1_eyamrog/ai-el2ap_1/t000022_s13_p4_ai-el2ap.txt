Up to 1942, fewer than 100 documents were published per
year; up to 1990, this number remained below 1,000; and
up to 1999, it was less than 10,000. The highest
annual output was recorded in 2015, with 58,025 articles. These
figures should be interpreted with caution, as they may not
accurately reflect the publication history of journals in Latin America
and the Caribbean. Analysis indicates that, for most older journals,
digitization and online availability of volumes published before 1998 are
incomplete. Specifically, data are available for only 78 journals with
documents published prior to 1998—the year SciELO was launched—suggesting that
the inclusion of documents predating a journal’s indexing in SciELO
was uncommon.
