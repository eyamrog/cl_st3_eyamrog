Some families were analyzed with only a single species classified
as a cleaner, such as Coraciidae, Cuculidae, and Furnariidae. Nevertheless,
there appears to be a tendency for cleaner species to
exhibit a more diverse diet compared to other species within
their respective families. For instance, in the Furnariidae family, the
mean H value was approximately 0.113 when excluding the cleaner
species (representing about 99.5% of the family), whereas the mean
H value for the cleaner species alone was approximately 0.5
(representing about 0.45% of the family). All relevant values are
presented in Supplementary Figure 1b.
