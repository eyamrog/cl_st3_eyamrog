Lopes and Furkotter (2016) report that, in the majority of
college degree programs, there is a near-complete lack of courses
that address the integration of information and communication technologies (ICT)
into the teaching-learning process. When such topics are included in
undergraduate curricula, they are typically presented with a technical emphasis
and are not integrated with other subject areas.
