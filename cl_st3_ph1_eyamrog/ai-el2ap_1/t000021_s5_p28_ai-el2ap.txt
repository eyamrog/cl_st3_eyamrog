In summary, the findings align with previous research indicating that
negative emotions, whether authentic or regulated, are present in daily
classroom activities and significantly influence teachers' emotional experiences (e.g., Bahia
et al., 2013; Taxer & Frenzel, 2015). The results also
support the model proposed by Fried et al. (2015), which
conceptualizes teachers' emotions as intrapersonal, interpersonal, and contextual, reflecting the
unique characteristics of the teaching profession. Additionally, the data suggest
that negative emotions are frequently subject to regulation due to
their potential to be counter-hedonic, counterproductive, and disruptive within the
educational context (e.g., English et al., 2017; Taxer & Frenzel,
2015).
