The archiving options discussed in this section reflect varying capacities
to achieve the primary objectives of preservation, conservation, and accessibility,
as outlined at the conclusion of ยง2. Although smaller-scale archiving
initiatives, such as those proposed here, may not fully align
with DELAMAN standards in all respects, they nonetheless contribute positively
toward these objectives and, in certain instances, may provide enhanced
accessibility despite more limited long-term preservation capabilities. Furthermore, as previously
mentioned, researchers should consider the potential for archiving materials at
both local or regional levels as well as within higher-infrastructure
archives. This approach is exemplified by the Paresi and Enawene
Nawe case studies presented in ยง6.
