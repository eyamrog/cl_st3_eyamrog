Originating as a set of music, dance, and martial arts
practices developed by the African diaspora in Brazil and historically
subject to resistance and violent repression, capoeira has evolved into
a global phenomenon with groups and networks established in various
locations worldwide, including London, Cape Town, Hong Kong, and Leeds,
the site of this research. This study examines the linguistic,
cultural, and embodied dimensions of capoeira by focusing on a
group in Leeds composed of diverse participants and led by
Sandro, a Brazilian contramestre. The group provides a valuable context
for investigating language learning in naturalistic settings, specifically regarding the
Afro-Brazilian linguistic and cultural practices—such as music, movement, lyrics, and
vocalization—that are integral to capoeira. These practices facilitate the integration
of characteristic capoeira movements, rhythmic regulation, and the embodied apprenticeship
of rhythm and movement during both rehearsal and performance. From
the perspective of informal language learning, the capoeira group appears
to offer an optimal environment for such processes. This research
explores the affordances of the capoeira group for linguistic, cultural,
and embodied learning of Afro-Brazilian Portuguese, utilizing the “maximalist” framework
for translanguaging (Baynham & Lee, 2019), which is extended here
to include the significant musical component of capoeira and is
connected to contemporary theories of informal and naturalistic language learning.
