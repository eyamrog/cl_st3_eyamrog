Various groups of Timorese with distinct interests have established specific
communities of practice. For example, one group forms a choir
that performs monthly at the Catholic Church, while another comprises
a traditional womenâ€™s dance troupe. However, this section of the
paper focuses on a particular all-male community of practice identified
during the research, which has emerged from a shared and
sustained interest in football.
