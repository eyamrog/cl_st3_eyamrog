Environmental conditions were characterized based on ecosystem type (rivers, lagoons,
and lakes), trophic state index (TSI), and pH, following the
methodological specifications outlined in Zorzal-Almeida et al. (2021). pH values
were classified as acidic (< 6.5), alkaline (> 7.5), or
circumneutral (6.5–7.5), according to Šťastný (2010). The occurrence frequency of
each taxon was determined as described by Zorzal-Almeida et al.
(2021). Taxa representing first records for Espírito Santo State are
indicated with [*], while those representing first records for Brazil
are indicated with [**]. All samples analyzed in this study
are deposited in the Herbarium VIES/UFES.
