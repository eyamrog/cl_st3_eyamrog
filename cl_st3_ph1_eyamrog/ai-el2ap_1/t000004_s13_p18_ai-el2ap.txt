In our analysis of the capoeira sessions we observed, we
employed the concept of translanguaging (Baynham & Lee, 2018) to
identify and examine the various communicative modalities present in the
capoeira environment, including verbal, gestural, embodied, and musical forms, and
to analyze how these modalities interact at different stages of
the session. In this study, we extend the framework proposed
by Baynham and Lee to explicitly incorporate the role of
music, given its central importance in capoeira practice. From this
perspective, the rhythmic coordination between bodily movement and music in
capoeira is conceptualized as a form of translanguaging, with music
constituting a critical component of the spatial repertoire (Rymes, 2014;
Pennycook & Otsuji, 2015; Canagarajah, 2018) characteristic of capoeira.
