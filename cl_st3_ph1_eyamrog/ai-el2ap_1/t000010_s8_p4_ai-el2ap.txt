Although these solutions are available, some authors note that the
variability of neuropsychological test performance in the pediatric population is
more complex than previously assumed. Solovieva et al. (2021) emphasize
that sociocultural factors have been identified as key determinants in
explaining the variability of neuropsychological development, whereas other reviews have
highlighted the influence of these factors on psychometric intelligence (Rea-Sandin
et al., 2021).
