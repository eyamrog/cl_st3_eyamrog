This interview is more sensitive for individuals with moderate or
severe neurological impairment than for those with only minor alterations;
consequently, Luria developed tasks tailored to each mental process to
allow for a more detailed and specific identification of deficits.
Luria’s method incorporates two fundamental components: the observation and analysis
of activities of daily living, and the use of targeted
tasks to confirm and specify the nature of the impairment
(16). It is important to note, however, that Luria originally
designed this assessment for adults with brain damage, not for
children. In response to this limitation, Mangas and Ramos (30),
as well as Solovieva and colleagues (31), adapted Luria’s approach
for use with preschool-aged children.
