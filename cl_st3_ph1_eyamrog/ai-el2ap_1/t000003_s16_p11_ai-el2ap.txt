Three of these young Timorese individuals (RS, HA, and MFB),
who had previously resided in Portugal or England before relocating
to Northern Ireland, demonstrated a relatively high level of proficiency
in both Portuguese and English. In contrast, all participants who
arrived in Northern Ireland during the second decade of the
twenty-first century had migrated directly from Timor-Leste to join friends
and family members already employed in the region. Most individuals
in this latter group had limited proficiency in English and
spoke little to no Portuguese. Their primary languages were a
regional Timorese language, Tetum, and, to a lesser extent, Bahasa
Indonesia. Consistent with language practices in Timor-Leste, Tetum emerged as
the principal language of wider communication within the Timorese community
in Northern Ireland.
