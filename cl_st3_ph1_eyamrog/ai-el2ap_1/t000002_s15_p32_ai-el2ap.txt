There is no clear or straightforward distinction between the sequences
of exploring and guiding explanations, as actual classroom interactions often
involve unplanned utterances, deviations, and unpredictable flows that complicate the
categorization of these sequences into a single type (Barnes, 1976).
Consequently, explanatory sequences should not be regarded as discrete or
mutually exclusive; rather, different categories may overlap within individual utterances.
This issue was previously noted by Mercer (1995) when he
introduced the three types of group talk.
