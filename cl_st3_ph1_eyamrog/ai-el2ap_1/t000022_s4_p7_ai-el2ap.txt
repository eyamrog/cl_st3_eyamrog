The collaborative practices exhibited by journals indexed in SciELO and
Redalyc, along with their affiliations to academic and university institutions,
indicate that this system facilitates broad dissemination and supports multi-scale
research initiatives, effectively addressing the current requirements of scholarly communication
in the context of open science. This effectiveness is attributable
not only to Latin America's established capabilities in professional scientific
publishing, indexing, and open access, but also to its experience
in generating interoperable regional indicators, as evidenced by joint publications
developed in collaboration with major regional indexing systems such as
PKP and CLACSO (Alperin, Babini, and Fischmann, 2014). Continued efforts
to enhance the visibility and comparability of Latin American research
output are likely to strengthen the regionâ€™s ability to address
two increasingly interconnected challenges: commercial pressures on the open science
movement and the pressing need to reform traditional research assessment
practices. The OLIVA project is expected to further encourage the
development of collaborative environments that support socially relevant and participatory
scientific research.
