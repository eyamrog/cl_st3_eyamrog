Our results indicate that the fracture toughness of liana leaf
laminas increases as the leaves dry, consistent with findings from
previous studies on grass leaves (Niklas 1992; Vincent 1990b, 1983).
As moisture content decreases, the leaves exhibit increased brittleness, reflected
in greater notch sensitivity. For instance, at 10% moisture content,
the average fracture toughness of A. crucigerum leaves is 280
J m⁻², whereas at 50% moisture content, the average fracture
toughness decreases to 200 J m⁻², representing a 30% reduction.
While detailed analyses of the effects of dehydration on leaf
fracture toughness have been conducted for a limited number of
species, primarily grasses (Vincent 1983, 1990b), the present study extends
this investigation to liana leaves.
