The cell is 1.3 to 1.4 times longer than broad,
with a shallow median constriction and a widely open sinus.
Semicells are semicircular with rounded apices and angles. The cell
wall is densely punctate, while the isthmus area is smooth.
Each cell contains four chloroplasts and four pyrenoids per semicell.
In apical view, the cell appears circular, and the lateral
view is consistent with the front view. Cell dimensions are
as follows: length 30–63 µm, width 23–47 µm, and isthmus
21–44 µm.
