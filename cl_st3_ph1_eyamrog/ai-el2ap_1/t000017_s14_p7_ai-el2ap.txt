Internal structure validity was assessed through exploratory factor analysis to
identify the number and composition of components required to summarize
the observed scores of the B-PREA-R. The analysis was conducted
in accordance with the theoretical guidelines proposed by Lloret-Segura et
al. (2014), which include evaluating data normality, applying the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin
(KMO) test to assess sampling adequacy, and considering the relative
merits of various extraction and rotation methods.
