The articles reviewed in Table 1 utilize the collected information
to identify strengths and weaknesses in the child's development, which
subsequently inform diagnosis and recommendations for intervention. However, the focus
of these studies is primarily limited to individual child analysis,
with insufficient consideration given to the assessment of the broader
group context in which the child interacts and receives developmental
influences. Furthermore, the evaluations predominantly rely on the outcomes of
administered tasks, with limited integration of systematic input from families
and other educational stakeholders.
