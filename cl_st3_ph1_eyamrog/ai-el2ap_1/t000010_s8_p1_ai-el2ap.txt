The impact of culture and education on neuropsychological test performance
has been documented for several years, particularly regarding the variability
observed among culturally diverse groups in domains such as language,
memory, visuospatial skills, and intelligence (Fog, 2021). This variability is
a significant factor for the scientific community to consider, as
it affects the validity and standardization of neuropsychological assessments, the
accurate classification of neuropsychological disorders, and the development of appropriate
therapeutic and educational interventions, especially in countries with high levels
of immigration such as the United States and those within
the European Community (Mercado et al., 2019).
