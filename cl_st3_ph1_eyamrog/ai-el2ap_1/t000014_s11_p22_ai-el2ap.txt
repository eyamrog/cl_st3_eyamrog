Before the 21st century, language documentation materials were commonly archived
only at the conclusion of a researcherâ€™s career or posthumously.
In contrast, the development of born-digital recording technologies, the establishment
of language archives, and the implementation of data archiving requirements
have led most contemporary researchers to archive their materials much
earlier in the research process.
