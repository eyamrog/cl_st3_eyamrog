variability in IQ, consistent with findings from previous research (Muchiut
et al., 2021). In the group of children from Sancti
Sp√≠ritus province, who exhibited higher IQ scores, fine motor and
manual skills emerged as significant neuropsychological predictors contributing to elevated
intellectual performance during the preschool years.
