This article presents a theoretical study aimed at discussing methodologies
and methods in educational research, with a particular focus on
those used to analyze classroom discursive interactions. The first section
examines the two principal research paradigms—positivism and interpretivism—along with their
respective ontological and epistemological foundations. Subsequently, two methods for analyzing
discursive interactions are introduced and evaluated, each corresponding to one
of the paradigms. Systematic coding, situated within the quantitative paradigm,
is recommended for processing data from large samples, describing general
patterns, and enabling statistical comparisons or temporal analyses by transforming
discourse into variables. This method is applied to a dataset
comprising 42 episodes of group dialogue, and the results are
discussed in relation to the research questions, illustrating the types
of statistical tests that can be conducted. Within the interpretivist
paradigm, sociocultural discourse analysis is presented as an example of
a qualitative method and is applied to selected excerpts from
classroom dialogues. The primary finding is the identification of typologies
that characterize how teachers and students collaboratively construct scientific explanations.
In the final section, the article discusses the possibilities and
limitations of each method and concludes that both approaches can
be considered complementary for advancing knowledge in the field of
education.
