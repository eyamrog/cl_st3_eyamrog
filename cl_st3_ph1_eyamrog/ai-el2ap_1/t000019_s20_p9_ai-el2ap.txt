The document’s implicit assumption that learning and the development of
autonomy are dependent on Digital Information and Communication Technologies (DICT)
reflects a deterministic perspective. However, the use of DICT alone
does not facilitate the development of critical and reflective capacities,
nor is it a prerequisite for meaningful learning. According to
researchers in intellectual development (Davydov, 1999; Luria, 2008; Libâneo, 2011),
meaningful learning is contingent upon teaching that incorporates logical and
investigative procedures specific to each discipline, indicating that the pedagogical
approach guided by the teacher is the primary factor driving
student learning and subsequent development. Notably, such teaching methods were
established by educators prior to the advent of DICT.
