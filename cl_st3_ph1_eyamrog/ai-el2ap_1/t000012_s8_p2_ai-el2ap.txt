Nestedness patterns indicate that ecological networks exhibit asymmetries, whereby species
with numerous interactions constitute a core, while species with fewer
interactions typically do not interact with each other (Bascompte et
al. 2003). In contrast, modularity patterns suggest that most interactions
are organized into modules, defined as semi-isolated and densely connected
groups of interacting species (Olesen et al. 2007; Pimm &
Lawton 1990). These nonrandom network patterns reflect both the variation
in average levels of specialization and generalism, and the nonrandom
distribution of niche overlap across different types of interactions (Guimarães
2020). Thus, the structure of ecological networks may partially represent
the underlying processes that shape ecological interactions and influence the
organization of ecological communities (Jordano et al. 2003; Bastolla et
al. 2009; Guimarães 2020).
