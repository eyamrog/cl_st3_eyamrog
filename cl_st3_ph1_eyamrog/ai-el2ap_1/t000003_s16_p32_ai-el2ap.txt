The football tournaments involving Timorese teams in Dungannon and Cookstown
are scheduled to coincide with dates of national and political
significance in Timor-Leste, specifically May 20, which marks the anniversary
of Independence, and August 30, which commemorates the anniversary of
the 1999 Referendum on Independence. Figure 3 presents two photographs
of the cup awarded to Fitun Unidade in the 2014
tournament held on May 20, as well as the medals
received by individual players for achievements such as "man of
the match" and highest goal scorer.
