Response modulation emerged as the third most prominent category of
emotion regulation strategies, indicating that teachers attempt to alter their
emotional responses even when avoidance is not feasible (Gross, 2015).
This strategy was primarily associated with extreme situations, particularly those
involving students' inappropriate behavior (English et al., 2017; Sutton, 2004;
Taxer & Gross, 2018; Yin, 2016), as well as conflicts
with colleagues and superiors, which may be attributed to a
perceived lack of control over these circumstances (BuriÄ‡ et al.,
2016). Consistent with previous research, teachers employed response modulation through
suppression strategies, behavioral adjustments, and social sharing (Akbari et al.,
2016; Sutton, 2004; Taxer & Gross, 2018; Yin, 2016).
