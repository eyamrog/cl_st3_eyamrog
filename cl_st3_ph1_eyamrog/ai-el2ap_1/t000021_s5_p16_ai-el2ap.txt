Teachers employ strategies intended to preemptively mitigate negative emotional responses,
such as ignoring minor behavioral infractions (Taxer & Gross, 2018;
Yin, 2016) or focusing on positive aspects like motivated students
and academic progress (Taxer & Gross, 2018). However, the avoidance
inherent in these approaches may impede the effective resolution of
routine emotional events and can result in long-term negative consequences
(Sheppes, 2014). Conversely, strategies characterized by excessive worry, rumination, and
fault identification have been shown to negatively affect teachers' emotional
states by anticipating, intensifying, and prolonging unpleasant experiences, which may
contribute to emotional and physical exhaustion (Nelis et al., 2011).
These latter strategies are therefore considered counterproductive in the teaching
context, as they allocate cognitive and emotional resources to negative
experiences rather than to the resolution of persistent classroom challenges,
thereby diminishing the adaptive and functional potential of emotion regulation.
