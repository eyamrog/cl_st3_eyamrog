After one year of storage, the viability of the stored
pyrenes was evaluated using a germination test to determine their
seed storage behavior. According to the classification proposed by Roberts
(1973) and Ellis et al. (1990), seed-bearing species are generally
categorized into three groups: orthodox or desiccation-tolerant seeds, which can
be preserved ex situ over the long term using standard
genebank protocols; recalcitrant or desiccation-intolerant seeds, which are suitable only
for short-term storage under strictly controlled environmental conditions; and intermediate
or partially desiccation-tolerant seeds, which can be maintained in medium-term
storage.
