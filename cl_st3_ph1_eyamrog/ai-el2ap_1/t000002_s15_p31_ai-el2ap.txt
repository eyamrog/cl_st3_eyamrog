The data corpus was analyzed to identify instances in which
explanations were constructed collaboratively by teachers and students. Analysis of
the 18 recorded episodes of whole-class teaching in this module
revealed five distinct types of explanatory sequences, which were categorized
into three overarching discursive acts based on whether the teacher
was exploring, guiding, or providing an explanation.
