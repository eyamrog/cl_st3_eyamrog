Teachers were assigned to groups according to two criteria—area of
training/occupation at IF and career level—in order to optimize sample
characteristics and facilitate comparative analysis (Figure 1). The total sample
comprised 41 vocational and technological education teachers who were invited
to participate in the study by IF course coordinators. The
majority of participants were male (n = 25). Additional details
regarding the sample are presented in Figure 1.
