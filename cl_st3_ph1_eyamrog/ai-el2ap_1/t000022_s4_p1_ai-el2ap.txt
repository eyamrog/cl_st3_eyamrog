As early as the 1980s and 1990s, numerous experts highlighted
the limited visibility of scientific research produced in Latin America,
noting that it was infrequently cited in international databases; this
situation led Gibbs (1995) to refer to a "lost science
of the third world." During this period, the region began
to strengthen its scholarly communication infrastructure with the aim of
increasing the recognition of its research outputs, which are characterized
by distinctive disciplinary focuses, research agendas, and publication languages. These
efforts prompted the development of policies and regional strategies to
improve the dissemination of Latin American science, resulting in the
establishment of a robust network of academic journals, indexing platforms,
institutional repositories, regional research networks, and major national universities that
regularly publish scholarly journals. However, this system evolved in a
fragmented manner, and despite significant institutional initiatives, fully interoperable systems
have not yet been achieved to ensure that Latin American
scientific production attains global visibility and recognition. In response to
this challenge, the OLIVA project was initiated at the Universidad
Nacional de Cuyo (Mendoza, Argentina) with the objective of enhancing
the value and impact of regionally assessed and indexed research
articles, thereby increasing their presence in academic evaluation systems.
