Several interviewees had resided in Portugal prior to relocating to
Northern Ireland and establishing themselves there. As a result, they
possessed a functional proficiency in Portuguese. For instance, one interviewee
had been among the students who sought refuge in an
embassy in Jakarta during the 1990s and was subsequently granted
safe passage to Portugal (Interview with HA, June 2015).
