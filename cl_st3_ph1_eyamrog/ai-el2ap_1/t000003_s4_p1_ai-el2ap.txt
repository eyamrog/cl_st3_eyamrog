This paper aims to contribute to the emerging field of
sociolinguistics that examines multilingualism and mobility, with a specific focus
on a transnational migration from the global south to the
north and west. The case study of Timorese migrants in
Northern Ireland highlights several key points: the necessity of moving
beyond purely synchronic approaches to include historical context in the
analysis of migration; the significance of understanding the specific dynamics
of south-north interactions; and the role that collective memories of
significant political events, as well as symbols of national identity,
play in shaping solidarity and a sense of belonging among
migrant communities.
