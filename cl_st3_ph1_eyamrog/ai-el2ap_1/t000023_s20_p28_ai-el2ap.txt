The specimens examined exhibited considerable variation in several morphological characteristics.
Cell shape ranged from pyramidal to slightly trapezoidal, basal angles
varied from broadly concave to straight, and the apex was
observed to be rounded, truncate, or slightly acute. These findings
are consistent with the observations of Bortolini et al. (2010),
who reported substantial morphological variation within this species, a pattern
that was also confirmed in the present study.
