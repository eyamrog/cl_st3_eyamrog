Long-read polishing generally enhances assembly accuracy; however, in some cases,
it may result in decreased accuracy. Consequently, it is not
always evident whether the unpolished assembly, the Medaka-polished assembly, or
an alternative such as the Clair3-polished assembly is optimal. ALE
is a tool that quantifies the concordance between an assembly
and a short-read dataset, thereby enabling the assessment of the
relative accuracy of different assemblies. Therefore, it is recommended to
use ALE to inform the selection of the assembly version
that should proceed to the subsequent step of short-read polishing.
