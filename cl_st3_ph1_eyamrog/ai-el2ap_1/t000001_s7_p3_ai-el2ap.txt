Many downstream analyses do not require high-quality assemblies; for example,
species identification or the detection of gene presence or absence
can often be performed using low-quality assemblies. However, certain applications,
such as estimating mutation rates and inferring transmission chains, demand
highly accurate assemblies, as even a small number of errors
can significantly impact results. Perfect assemblies eliminate constraints on downstream
analyses, rendering the question of assembly sufficiency irrelevant. In the
absence of assembly errors, many analyses that currently rely on
direct read interrogation through computationally intensive methods, such as variant
calling, could instead utilize more efficient assembly-based approaches.
