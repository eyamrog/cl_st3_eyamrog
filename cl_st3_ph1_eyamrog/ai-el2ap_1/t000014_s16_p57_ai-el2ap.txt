The metadata were initially organized in an Excel spreadsheet and
subsequently imported into the Lameta program (Halton et al., 2021).
Each session comprises an audio file, a video file, and
either an annotation in ELAN (.EAF format) or elicitation materials
in PDF format. IMDI files (ISLE Metadata Initiative) were generated
for each session, providing information about the recordings, including the
participants, subject matter, content description, and relevant keywords. Additionally, sets
of photographs were categorized into community, craft, school, daily life,
researchers, training, people, and work.
