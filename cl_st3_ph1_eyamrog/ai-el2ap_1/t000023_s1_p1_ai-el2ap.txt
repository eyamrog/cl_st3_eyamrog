This study aimed to identify and document species of Cosmarium
Corda (Zygnematophyceae, Desmidiaceae) with smooth or finely punctate cell walls
in the lower Doce River region, Espírito Santo State, Brazil,
following the flow of ore tailings. Periphytic samples were collected
monthly from October 2018 to February 2020, with the exception
of October 2019. A total of 22 taxa were identified,
and the environmental conditions associated with each taxon, including trophic
state, pH, and total iron concentration, were analyzed. The study
reports 21 new records of smooth cell-walled Cosmarium species for
Espírito Santo State and one new record for Brazil, specifically
Cosmarium trilobulatum var. tumidum Willi Krieger & Gerloff.
