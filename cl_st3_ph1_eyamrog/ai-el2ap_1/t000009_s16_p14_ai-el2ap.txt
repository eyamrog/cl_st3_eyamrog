present novel research findings, offer substantial theoretical or practical advancements,
and are supported by comprehensive empirical or analytical evidence. Additionally,
they adhere to established guidelines for clarity, reproducibility, and ethical
research practices, thereby contributing meaningfully to the ongoing discourse within
the computer science community.
