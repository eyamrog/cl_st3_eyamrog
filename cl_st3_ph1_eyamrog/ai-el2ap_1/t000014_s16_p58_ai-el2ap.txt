All data from the Paresi project are stored in the
archive of the Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi and are not
yet publicly accessible. Twenty hours of material collected during the
period of financial support from the Endangered Languages Documentation Programme
(ELDP, 2011–2012) are also archived at the Endangered Language Archive
(ELAR) associated with this institution. An additional thirty hours of
material are stored at the Archive of the Indigenous Languages
of the Americas (AILLA) at the University of Texas at
Austin, with some materials available online. Portions of the material
collected in the Enawene Nawe project have been organized in
ELAR and will also be made available in the Goeldi
archive.
