This indicates that the analysis of human psychophysiology can proceed
along two primary directions: organic psychophysiology, which seeks to explain
brain functioning, and activity psychophysiology, which focuses on describing and
explaining the mental processes underlying human actions. Both approaches are
encompassed within cognitive neuroscience, a field dedicated to the scientific
investigation of the biological mechanisms underlying cognition, with particular emphasis
on the neural substrates of mental processes and their behavioral
manifestations.
