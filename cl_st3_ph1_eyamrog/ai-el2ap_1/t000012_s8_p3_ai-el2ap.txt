In the simplest scenario, individuals of different species function as
generalists, interacting with partners opportunistically, such as by utilizing resources
in proportion to their environmental availability. While substantial evidence indicates
deviations from interaction patterns predicted solely by resource availability (Olesen
et al. 2011; Kuebbing et al. 2013; Pekkonen et al.
2013), the assumption that individuals behave as opportunistic foragers provides
a useful framework for understanding the structure of ecological networks.
In particular, opportunistic behavior at the individual level suggests that,
at the species level, variation in the number of interactions
among species should be positively correlated with species abundances (Vazquez
et al. 2007; Krishna et al. 2008).
