This area functions as a tactical space, as being pushed
toward the limits of the roda—defined by the individuals seated
around it—places a capoeirista in a disadvantageous position due to
the restricted range of movements available. When approaching the boundaries
of the roda, a capoeirista typically attempts to escape this
constrained area in order to regain a more favorable position.
