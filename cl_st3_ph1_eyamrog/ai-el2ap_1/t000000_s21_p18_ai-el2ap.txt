dark brown, acuminate scales near the base; laminae 20–35 cm
long, typically 2-pinnate, occasionally 1- or 3-pinnate; rachises not winged,
stramineous, with sparse 2-celled glandular hairs or becoming glabrescent; basal
pinnae 12–25 cm × 1–2 cm; pinnules short-petiolate, dimidiate or
flabellate, up to 1 cm long; costae on both abaxial
and adaxial surfaces with sparse 2-celled glandular hairs or glabrescent;
veins on both surfaces with sparse 2-celled glandular hairs or
glabrous; laminar tissue between veins on both surfaces with sparse
2-celled glandular hairs or glabrous; sori interrupted, located at the
