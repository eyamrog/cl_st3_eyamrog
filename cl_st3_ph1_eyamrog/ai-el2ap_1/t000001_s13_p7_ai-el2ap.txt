Since Illumina reads are used exclusively for final polishing (see
Step 5), they are of secondary importance compared to ONT
reads. Most contemporary Illumina platforms generate comparable data, typically 150-bp
paired-end reads, and are equally suitable for bacterial whole-genome sequencing;
thus, the choice of instrument is primarily determined by cost
and multiplexing requirements. Nextera XT library preparations are associated with
variable read depth across the genome, which can result in
regions of low coverage; therefore, Illumina DNA Prep (also known
as Nextera DNA Flex) and TruSeq are generally preferred. If
Nextera XT is employed, a high mean depth (e.g., 300×)
is recommended to mitigate depth variability, whereas a mean depth
of 100× is usually adequate with other library preparations. For
genomes with high repeat content, mate-pair library preparations may enhance
the effectiveness of short-read polishing (see Pitfalls). Following sequencing, it
is advisable to use a quality control tool such as
fastp to remove low-quality bases and adapter sequences.
