This information was essential for designing tasks aimed at better
preparing the target students—computer science graduate students from various regions
of Brazil—for the diverse contextual limitations and constraints they may
encounter in academia. The tasks were intended to help students
develop strategies to address these challenges and, where possible, to
work toward solutions that could improve research practices and contribute
to the advancement of their academic community. The use of
information and communication technologies (ICT) in the contextual TSA also
influenced praxis, as it enabled the teacher-researcher to gather comprehensive
data from members of a global community, thereby informing and
enhancing her instructional approaches. This topic is examined in greater
detail in the following subsection.
