During our fieldwork, we observed six capoeira classes held at
a community centre, each occurring one evening per week and
occasionally followed by informal social gatherings at a nearby club.
Additionally, we attended two capoeira workshops led by visiting mestres
invited by Sandro; one workshop was conducted in a community
centre in Leeds and the other in a church hall
in York. Both workshops lasted approximately four hours, beginning at
2:00 pm and concluding around 6:00 pm. Following these workshops,
participants engaged in further social activities, including a meal at
a local pub after one session and a gathering at
a student’s residence featuring Brazilian cuisine after the other. We
also observed a roda organized on a weekend, primarily attended
by Sandro’s students from Leeds and York, which was held
in an Afro-Cuban drumming studio.
