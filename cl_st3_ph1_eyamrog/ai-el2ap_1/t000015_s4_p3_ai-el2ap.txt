The global scale of current publishing activity reflects a broader
trend identified by Achille Mbembe at the University of the
Witwatersrand, who, in reference to Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o’s re-centering project,
asserts that “the decolonizing project is back on the agenda
worldwide” (2019, p. 18, original emphasis). Mbembe further argues that
this agenda has the potential to transform universities into “platforms
for the redistribution of different kinds of knowledges” (p. 7,
original emphasis). The findings of this study indicate that such
linguistic and geopolitical shifts are already occurring within scholarly communication.
These developments demonstrate that a more global, diverse, and inclusive
system of academic exchange is not merely a future possibility
or a theoretical objective, but a process that is currently
in progress and yielding benefits on an international scale.
