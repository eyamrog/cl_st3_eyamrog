Basic common knowledge serves as a foundation for the development
of scientific understanding and is therefore relevant; however, educational institutions
should not be limited to imparting only this type of
knowledge. The primary function of schools is to provide instruction
in concepts and principles that are not typically encountered in
everyday life. Reliance solely on everyday knowledge does not sufficiently
enhance cognitive abilities, as the development of higher-order thinking requires
a conceptual understanding of phenomena, which in turn fosters dialectical
reasoning from an early age. For instance, while many individuals
may know how to make bread, few can explain the
physicochemical processes involved in bread-making; only those who can articulate
these underlying mechanisms demonstrate true mastery of the subject and
are thus equipped to analyze and innovate within the field.
