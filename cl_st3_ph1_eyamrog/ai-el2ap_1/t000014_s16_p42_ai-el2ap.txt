The objective in transporting legacy materials is to relocate them
to a site with improved storage conditions, such as reduced
humidity, either temporarily or as an intermediate step before transfer
to an archive, or directly to an archival facility. Transportation
represents a period of heightened risk for archival materials. When
possible, particularly fragile items such as tapes should be transported
personally, for instance in carry-on luggage. For other materials, it
is essential to maintain dryness, for example by using plastic
coverings, and to keep items separated from those that could
cause damage. If shipping is required, high-quality cardboard boxes with
sufficient tape and bubble wrap should be used, and, when
financially feasible, airmail is preferable to ground transportation due to
typically reduced handling. It is advisable to consult with an
archive during this process, as archival staff can provide guidance
on best practices for transport, cataloging, and digitization. Digitization of
analog sound recordings and film is generally urgent, given the
ongoing degradation of original media and the likelihood that previous
storage conditions did not meet archival standards. Issues such as
humidity and water damage are particularly prevalent.
