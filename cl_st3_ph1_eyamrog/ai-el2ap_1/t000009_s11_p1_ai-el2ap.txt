This section examines the complexity inherent in language teaching and
learning within CEAP courses to substantiate the necessity of conducting
a contextual target situation analysis as part of the needs
analysis process, a practice that is relatively uncommon in the
EAP/ESP literature. Subsequently, the section discusses the application of information
and communication technology (ICT) as a methodological tool for implementing
such an analysis during the development of online CEAP courses.
