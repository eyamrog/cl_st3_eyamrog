Survival of relocated specimens at each observation and over time—Relocation
has been recognized as a viable method for plant conservation
in situations involving forest removal due to road construction (Jasper
et al. 2005). Barrancos et al. (2016) demonstrated that transplanting
bromeliads can serve as a straightforward and non-destructive strategy to
address the limitations of epiphyte dispersal and to facilitate biodiversity
recovery. As indicated in Table 1, A. distichantha specimens transplanted
in the terricolous form did not exhibit a statistically significant
difference (p > 0.05) in survival rates between vegetative and
reproductive stages throughout the observation period. Plants relocated as either
terricolous or epiphytic during the vegetative stage exhibited 100% survival
(Table 1). A statistically significant decrease in survival was observed
only when plants were relocated as epiphytes in the reproductive
stage, with survival declining to 83.33% after 287 days from
the start of the experiment (from an initial 100%) (Table
1). Nevertheless, this survival rate remains relatively high. The elevated
survival percentages are likely attributable to the fact that the
bromeliads were maintained under nursery conditions in pots, which provided
improved nutrition and favorable phytosanitary conditions. The survival rates observed
for A. distichantha in this study were higher than those
reported in similar studies of relocated Aechmea species, which showed
a survival rate of 62.5% (Araújo 2006). The relocation procedure
employed in this study closely resembled standard rescue protocols used
by company personnel, wherein A. distichantha plants are randomly collected
from their natural forest environment, regardless of whether they are
epiphytic or terricolous.
