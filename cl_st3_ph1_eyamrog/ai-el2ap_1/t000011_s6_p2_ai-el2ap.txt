It is well established that environmental temperature and humidity directly
influence the water status of plant structures, and that both
anatomical composition and water status affect the biomechanical properties of
these structures (Niklas 1992, Vincent 1992, Rowe et al. 2005).
Consequently, most plant biomechanics studies maintain sample moisture immediately after
collection to ensure that measurements closely reflect the properties of
living plants in their natural environment. However, prior to the
present study, the extent to which dehydration alters the values
of bending stiffness in liana stems and fracture toughness in
leaves had not been quantified.
