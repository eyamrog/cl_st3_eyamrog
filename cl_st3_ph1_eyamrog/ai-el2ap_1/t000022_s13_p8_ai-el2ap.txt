The disciplinary composition of the journals included in the OLIVA
database is as follows: Social Sciences account for 33% of
the total, Medical and Health Sciences for 19%, Humanities for
12%, and Natural and Exact Sciences for 10%. Analysis of
the disciplinary distribution by country of publication indicates that Social
Sciences journals are predominant in Uruguay, Ecuador, Puerto Rico, Brazil,
Bolivia, Mexico, and Peru (see Figure 3). Medical and Health
Sciences journals constitute a significant proportion in Cuba, Uruguay, Bolivia,
Costa Rica, and Peru. Journals in the Natural and Exact
Sciences have their highest relative representation in Argentina, Bolivia, and
Brazil. Figure 3 presents the disciplinary areas of the journals
and facilitates comparison of their distribution between countries with lower
visibility, such as those in Central America and the Caribbean,
and the major contributors in the region.
