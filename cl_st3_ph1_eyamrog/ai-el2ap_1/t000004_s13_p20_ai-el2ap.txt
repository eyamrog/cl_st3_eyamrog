As previously indicated, music plays a central role in the
practice of capoeira, serving to coordinate and regulate bodily movements
in a rhythmic manner. Capoeira rodas are consistently accompanied by
live music; moreover, even during Sandroâ€™s classes, when students practiced
individual movements in isolation, recorded music was continuously played in
the background.
