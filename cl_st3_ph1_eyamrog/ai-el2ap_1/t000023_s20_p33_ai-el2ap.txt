The cell is 1.5 to 1.6 times longer than broad,
with a deep median constriction and a linear sinus. Semicells
are semicircular to subpyramidal, with the apical margin often asymmetrical;
the apex is rounded to slightly truncate, and the basal
angles are rounded. The cell wall is smooth. Each cell
contains a single chloroplast and one pyrenoid per semicell. In
lateral view, the cell appears subcircular. Cell dimensions are as
follows: length 18–20.4 µm, width 12.9–13.8 µm, and isthmus 3.7–4.4
µm.
