South-north migration is closely linked to global power asymmetries and
significant economic transformations characteristic of late capitalism. As Adey (2006,
pp. 85–86) notes, mobility, similar to power, is relational and
distributed unevenly across populations. The ability of certain social actors
to move must be understood in relation to the restricted
mobility of others, and migration from the global south to
the north and west often entails changes in individuals’ positions
within social hierarchies. Duchêne and Heller (2012, pp. 15–16) further
emphasize that the social landscape is characterized by unevenness, lack
of clear boundaries, and fluidity, with social actors occupying varied
and unequally advantageous positions regarding access to circulating resources.
