In addition to the data provided by CGI.br, the bibliographic
review on teacher training in digital information and communication technologies
(DICT) indicates that there has been minimal curricular change at
the level of initial teacher education, despite the official inclusion
of information and communication technologies (ICT) in the Brazilian curriculum
since the mid-1990s (Gatti & Barreto, 2009; Lopes & Furkotter,
2016; Dorneles, 2012; Santos, 2009; Marinho, 2008).
