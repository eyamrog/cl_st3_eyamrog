Several network patterns can be attributed to differences in species
abundance (VÃ¡zquez et al. 2005, 2007; Lewinsohn et al. 2006),
indicating that opportunism plays a significant role in the organization
of many ecological networks. Opportunism may enable species to participate
in novel interactions, utilize new resources, and contribute to the
structuring of species interaction networks at the community level. For
species to establish new interactions, their traits and behaviors must
permit interactions with a wide range of individuals and species.
Therefore, the occurrence of new interactions and opportunistic behavior is
influenced not only by resource availability but also by the
diversity of resource use.
