In the following extract (3), students had just read a
brief text about particle theory and were collectively answering questions
from a handout. During these interactions, the teacher generally accepted
responses such as ‘separate’, ‘get further away from each other’,
and ‘move faster’. She also explicitly requested two additional items
(lines 50 and 53), to which students responded with ‘energy’
and ‘freely’. The teacher appeared to seek specific keywords from
the text in students’ responses. Once these expected answers or
their synonyms were provided, the teacher delivered a complete explanation
in the final line. These questions were not coded as
dialogic (lines 50, 53, and 55) because the expected answers
were available in the handout, and students were primarily repeating
them aloud, often with hesitation as indicated in line 56.
While the activity may have assessed students’ comprehension of the
text, it is less clear whether it facilitated exploration of
underlying explanations.
