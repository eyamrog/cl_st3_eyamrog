Two of the individuals interviewed in June 2015 (RS and
HA) were among the earliest groups to arrive in Dungannon,
having migrated directly from Portugal in 2001 and 2002. They
obtained employment through an agency based in Portugal (Interviews, June
2015). Another interviewee (MFB) had previously worked in England before
relocating to Northern Ireland, which provided prior experience with English
in a professional context (Interview with MFB, June 2015).
