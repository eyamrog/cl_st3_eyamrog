Conversely, the battery is designed to cluster tasks associated with
the child's language and memory development. For language development, three
subtests are employed to evaluate semantic and phonological abilities, specifically
vocabulary, verbal working memory, and syllable repetition. Regarding memory, the
battery identifies a third factor, termed working memory skills, wherein
the nature of the tasks supports the distinction of this
factor from the other subtests included in the B-PREA-R.
