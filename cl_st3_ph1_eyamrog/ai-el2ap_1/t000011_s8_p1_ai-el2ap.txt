Plants are subject to various environmental pressures and must maintain
resistance to damage, stress, and structural support throughout their lifespan.
The damage resistance and structural support of stems and leaves
in woody plants can be biomechanically assessed through measurements of
stiffness, bending, and toughness (Niklas 1992; Speck 1994; Rowe &
Speck 1996; Speck & Rowe 1999; Niklas et al. 2006;
Rowe et al. 2005). Biomechanical properties have also been investigated
in studies examining potential associations between animal feeding behavior and
the mechanical characteristics of the plant parts consumed. For instance,
the physical properties of leaves and stems have been linked
to the masticatory morphology of primates (Strait 1997), and there
is evidence suggesting possible coevolution between animal consumers and plant
mechanical traits (Thiery et al. 2017). In these studies, the
biomechanical properties of plant structures are quantified using mechanical tests.
Structural Young’s modulus, for example, quantifies bending stiffness relative to
the sample’s cross-sectional area (Niklas 1992), while toughness refers to
a material’s resistance to fracture and is defined as the
energy required to break an object. Toughness is typically measured
as the area under a stress-strain curve, representing the work
done per unit volume (Vincent 1992; Niklas 1992). These mechanical
properties are influenced by the composition, geometry, and water content
of the material (Niklas 1992; Vincent 1990a). While the mechanical
properties of homogeneous materials such as plastics or metals are
well characterized, less is known about the mechanical behavior of
heterogeneous biological materials, including plant structures.
