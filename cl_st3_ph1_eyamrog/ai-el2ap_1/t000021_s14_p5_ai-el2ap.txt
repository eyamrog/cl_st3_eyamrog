The focus group sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed, resulting in
a corpus of 103 pages. To categorize emotions, a deductive
approach was employed based on the list of primary and
secondary emotions proposed by Parrot (2001). Thematic content analysis, as
outlined by Bardin (2011), was initially applied to examine the
strategies, utilizing existing emotional regulation models from the literature to
inform the development of an open coding system that grouped
strategies into predefined, broad categories. Once the coding system was
established, an inductive analysis was conducted with the assistance of
Atlas.ti software to identify context-specific strategies and tactics not previously
addressed in the literature, as well as to facilitate the
grouping, quantification, and analysis of the data. Systematic comparison of
coded items was performed iteratively until data saturation was achieved,
indicating that no new (sub)categories were emerging and further reorganization
was unnecessary. This methodological approach enabled the identification of a
diverse range of strategies and tactics employed by classroom teachers,
which were subsequently organized according to a theoretical model of
emotional regulation referenced in the literature (see Figure 2).
