Originally described by Ralfs in 1848, the genus Cosmarium Corda
comprises over 1,500 taxa and represents the most speciose and
one of the oldest genera within the family Desmidiaceae. Members
of this genus are typically free-living unicellular organisms characterized by
a median constriction, which ranges from a deep, closed depression
to a widely open and shallow groove, dividing the cell
into two symmetrical semicells; the shape and size of these
semicells vary among species (Bicudo & Menezes 2017). The taxonomy
of Cosmarium is primarily based on cell outline and cell
wall ornamentation. For practical classification, taxonomists often divide the genus
into two artificial groups: one with ornamented cell walls, exhibiting
features such as granules, scrobiculations, or spines, and another with
smooth or finely punctate cell walls.
