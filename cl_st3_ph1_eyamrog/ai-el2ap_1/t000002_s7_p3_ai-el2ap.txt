Interventionist research has examined and identified specific forms of enhanced
teacher-student interactions that facilitate teaching and learning (e.g., Mercer, 2002).
A key finding from this body of work is that
the nature of classroom discourse significantly influences the learning opportunities
available to students (Howe & Mercer, 2007; Kelly, 2014; Lemke,
2001). As Nystrand (1997, p. 29) states, "the quality of
student learning is closely linked to the quality of classroom
talk."
