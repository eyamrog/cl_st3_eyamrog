This information enabled the teacher-researcher to determine the relative importance
of each investigated factor (contextual, textual, linguistic, etc.) in the
acceptance or rejection of papers submitted by Brazilian computer scientists
to high-impact journals. As shown in Table 3, while proficiency
in academic English is considered in reviewers’ evaluations, it is
not the primary criterion for publication recommendations. Instead, the validity
and originality of the research are prioritized, followed by the
clarity, organization, and accuracy of the manuscript. Based on the
assessment of students’ current abilities, the teacher-researcher was able to
develop an appropriate syllabus and design targeted tasks to address
students’ specific needs (cf. Vieira, 2019a).
