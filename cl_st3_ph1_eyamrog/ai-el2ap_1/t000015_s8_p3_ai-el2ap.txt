The challenges associated with achieving proper integration within higher education
systems in formerly colonized regions have a postcolonial dimension, as
discussed by Altbach in "The University as Center and Periphery"
(1981). Altbach observed that universities in the so-called "Third World"
primarily function as distributors of knowledge and remain dependent on
central institutions in more developed countries for innovation and direction.
He identified several obstacles to developing robust research capabilities in
these peripheral universities, including limited opportunities for scholarship, creative writing,
and research dissemination by local intellectuals, largely due to a
lack of interest from publishers in works by authors from
these regions. Altbach characterized this enduring "colonial educational heritage" as
a form of neocolonialism that is difficult to overcome, noting
that the prospects for establishing fully autonomous and effective publishing
enterprises in Africa are limited (1976, p. 461). He further
cautioned that universities in these contexts must contend not only
with the historical and economic power of industrialized nations but
also with the ongoing efforts of these nations to maintain
their dominant positions (1981).
