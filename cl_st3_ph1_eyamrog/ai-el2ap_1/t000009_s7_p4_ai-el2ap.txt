A three-phase investigation was conducted using various technological tools to
collect data on contextual factors influencing the production and publication
of research articles by Brazilian computer science experts, with the
objective of designing an online Critical English for Academic Purposes
(CEAP) course for graduate students. This paper aims to demonstrate
the potential of information and communication technologies (ICT) to facilitate
contextual target situation analysis remotely, thereby broadening the scope of
the investigation and optimizing the use of time and resources
in course development.
