In accordance with the objectives of Brazilian education, the primary
function of the school is to promote the comprehensive development
of students, rather than limiting its focus to the acquisition
of skills solely for the labor market. Such a restriction
would undermine the school's essential role in fulfilling its primary
purposes, which include teaching academic content and fostering the development
of students' intellectual abilities necessary for their effective participation in
society (Lib√¢neo, 2016b, p. 48).
