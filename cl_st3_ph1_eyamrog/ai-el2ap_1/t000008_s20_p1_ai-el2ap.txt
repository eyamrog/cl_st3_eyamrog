Copernicia alba Morong seeds exhibited no evidence of dormancy under
the tested conditions. Freshly harvested pyrenes achieved a germination rate
of 84% (Figure 2a), indicating a high level of germinability.
Similar results were reported by Masetto et al. (2012) for
seeds collected from natural populations in the Pantanal. However, in
contrast to the present findings, both Masetto et al. (2012)
and Fava & Albuquerque (2011) reported the presence of seed
dormancy in this species. Genetic factors may influence seed germination
by affecting seed viability and quality among populations from different
regions (Soler-Guilhen et al. 2020). The initial moisture content of
the pyrenes was approximately 10%, which is consistent with values
reported by Fabri (2018) (10%) and Masetto et al. (2012)
(16.6%) for the same species, with fruits in both studies
collected from natural populations in the Pantanal wetland, Mato Grosso
do Sul State. The thick endocarp of C. alba was
permeable to water and did not inhibit germination. In contrast,
seeds of other palm species with a stony endocarp, such
as Butia capitata Mart. Becc. (Soares et al. 2021), Syagrus
romanzoffiana (Cham.) Glassman (Oliveira et al. 2015), and Bactris maraja
Mart. (Rodrigues et al. 2014), have been reported to experience
delayed germination due to mechanical restriction, with these species occurring
in the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) and Amazon Forest. The absence
of seed dormancy in C. alba may facilitate recruitment in
the Pantanal wetlands, where seeds and pyrenes are exposed to
flooding, as evidenced by rapid seedling emergence following flood events
(Bao et al. 2018). Although many palm seeds exhibit morphophysiological
dormancy due to an underdeveloped embryo and/or mechanical barriers imposed
by a thick endocarp (PÃ©rez 2009; Baskin & Baskin 2014),
the pyrenes of C. alba in this study germinated readily
under laboratory conditions.
