In contrast, newer indexing platforms such as Dimensions and OpenAlex
demonstrate improved coverage, indexing 54.3% and 63.8% of JUOJS, respectively,
by utilizing automated aggregation from open resources including Microsoft Academic
Graph, Crossref, Unpaywall, DOAJ, ORCID, and PubMed. Additionally, 88.3% of
JUOJS are indexed in Google Scholar. This high level of
coverage can be attributed in part to sustained efforts by
Google Scholarâ€™s lead engineer, Anurag Acharya, who initiated ongoing collaboration
with PKP beginning in 2004 to enhance the indexing of
JUOJS through technical improvements on both sides. These findings indicate
that targeted and sustained initiatives are required to address the
historical underrepresentation of certain journals in major indexing systems.
