The second method examined in this paper is sociocultural discourse
analysis, which emphasizes the contextual and situated nature of speech
turns while facilitating a deeper understanding of participants' contributions. This
qualitative approach enables researchers to identify participants' underlying intentions and
responses to others, and allows for analysis that extends beyond
the immediate data, such as recognizing missed opportunities for further
development or challenge (Hennessy et al., 2020, p. 6). Additionally,
categorizing extracts in their entirety supports the construction of analytical
models, as categories and typologies emerge from the data itself
rather than being predetermined, thereby providing a more nuanced account
of discourse practices (Mercer, 2010).
