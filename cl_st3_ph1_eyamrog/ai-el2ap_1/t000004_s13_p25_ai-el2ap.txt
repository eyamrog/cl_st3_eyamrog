Capoeira may appear to be a dance to external observers
because its movements are performed in synchrony with music and
the two participants often move in a coordinated manner. However,
the classification of capoeira as a dance is subject to
debate. The origins of capoeira are commonly traced to African
war dances, such as the Zebra dance (Cobra Mansa; Assunção,
2008), which incorporated combative elements, including kicks. Consequently, the distinction
between dance and combat in capoeira is not always clear.
Similar combative elements are also present in certain styles of
samba, which likewise have roots in African traditions.
