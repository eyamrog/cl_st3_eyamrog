The cell is 1.2 to 1.4 times longer than broad,
with a moderate median constriction; the sinus is closed near
the isthmus and gradually opens toward the extremity. Semicells are
semicircular, with the apex rounded to slightly truncate and basal
angles rounded. The cell wall is punctate. Each semicell contains
two chloroplasts, and a pyrenoid was not observed. Cell dimensions
are as follows: length 86–130 µm, width 65–94 µm, and
isthmus 31–39 µm.
