All research paradigms can be applied to the analysis of
classroom interaction and can contribute to the generation of new
knowledge. For example, the positivist approach requires the simplification of
social practices to facilitate manageable research, typically by selecting specific
dialogue variables and controlling others related to learning outcomes (Asterhan
et al., 2020). This approach enables researchers to make claims
regarding the effects of dialogic teaching on student learning. In
contrast, the interpretivist paradigm offers a more nuanced understanding of
dialogue dynamics, often through ethnographic case studies that emphasize the
cultural context of the classroom (Asterhan et al., 2020). As
previously noted, each paradigm necessitates distinct methodological approaches to address
research questions of varying nature. The primary objective of this
discussion paper is to examine these methodological considerations.
