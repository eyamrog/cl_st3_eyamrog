All of these logos feature visual elements that establish a
connection to Timor-Leste. Specifically, the FC Lao Rai United logo
includes a depiction of the map of Timor-Leste; the Young
Crocs logo prominently displays a crocodile; and the logos for
both the Ramkabian and Young Crocs teams incorporate the star
from the national flag as well as the flag’s colors—red,
yellow, black, and white. These logos were all designed using
online platforms and were primarily utilized as digital images distributed
through electronic media.
