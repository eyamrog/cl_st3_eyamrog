Qualitative methods grounded in the interpretivist paradigm typically consider the
cultural and social contexts and practices that influence classroom interaction
(e.g., Gee & Green, 1998). These approaches are based on
the premise that knowledge is socially constructed through language. Methods
such as linguistic ethnography, sociolinguistics, and discourse analysis are commonly
employed within this framework (Hennessy et al., 2020). Generally, these
methods emphasize the contextual and sociocultural dimensions of interaction rather
than focusing solely on the mechanics of verbal exchange, such
as turn-taking. This is because discourse is conceptualized broadly to
include the text (whether spoken, written, or visual), the discursive
practices involved in producing and interpreting the text, and the
social practices and structures associated with power and knowledge (Gregory,
2020).
