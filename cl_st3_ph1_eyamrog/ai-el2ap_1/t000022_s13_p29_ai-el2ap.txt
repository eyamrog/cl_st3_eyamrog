Regarding language trends, the OLIVA corpus demonstrates considerable linguistic diversity,
in contrast to the predominance of English observed in mainstream
databases. This diversity is attributable to the regionâ€™s development of
multilingual indexing and publishing protocols and infrastructures. As shown in
Table 4, Spanish and Portuguese occupy central roles, while English
accounts for 23.9% of the articles. French and other languages
are minimally represented, with some languages appearing only once. Portuguese
is primarily found in journals published in Brazil, where 62.4%
of articles are published in Portuguese and 34.6% in English.
The proportion of English-language articles in Brazilian journals is comparable
to that in journals from Puerto Rico (50.5%), Chile (23.7%),
and Mexico (17.1%). The relatively high percentage of English in
Chilean journals may reflect an academic culture more aligned with
mainstream international standards, while the figures for Mexico and Puerto
Rico may be influenced by established academic connections.
