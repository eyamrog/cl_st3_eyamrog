This study evaluated the content validity, internal structure validity, and
internal consistency reliability of the B-PREA-R, an instrument developed to
assess the cognitive development of preschool children within the Cuban
cultural context and intended for use by educators. Compared to
the previous version (Ramirez et al., 2018), the content validity
of the B-PREA-R demonstrated improvement. The original B-PREA consisted of
110 items, of which 28% exhibited low discrimination. In contrast,
the revised B-PREA-R comprises nine subtests with a total of
199 items, including 193 items of high or good quality
and six items of regular quality. The earlier version identified
the vocabulary, syllable rhymes, matrices, and comparing quantities subtests as
areas requiring enhancement. In the B-PREA-R, the matrices subtest was
revised to include 15 items with good discrimination, and the
counting quantities subtest now contains only items of good quality.
The syllable rhyming subtest was removed, and a new syllable
repeating subtest was developed, consisting of 16 items of good
quality and four of fair quality. Additionally, the vocabulary subtest
was improved to include 18 items of good quality and
two items of fair quality.
