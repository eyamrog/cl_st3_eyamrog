Positivist research aims to achieve objectivity, measurability, predictability, controllability, and
the identification of patterns, with the goal of constructing laws
and rules of behavior and seeking causal explanations to support
its claims (Cohen et al., 2007, p. 26; Treagust et
al., 2014). In this context, quantitative methods are particularly compatible
with the positivist paradigm, as they attempt to represent social
reality using predefined categories and measurements, and are oriented toward
providing explanations based on cause-and-effect relationships.
