These findings suggest that teachers sometimes integrate hetero-regulation and self-regulation
strategies to address emotional demands and enhance the effectiveness of
emotion regulation, thereby illustrating the dynamic and complex nature of
teacher emotion regulation (e.g., Sutton, 2004; Taxer & Gross, 2018).
Furthermore, the results indicate that both emotional and pedagogical repertoires
are required for these regulatory processes to be effective.
