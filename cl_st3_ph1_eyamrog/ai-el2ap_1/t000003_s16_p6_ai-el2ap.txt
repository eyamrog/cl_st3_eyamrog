Data obtained from participant observation, interviews, and previous research conducted
in Dungannon by Da Costa Cabral (2010) indicate significant diversity
among young Timorese individuals currently residing and working in Dungannon
and Cookstown. These individuals originate from various districts of Timor-Leste
and speak a range of regional languages, such as Fataluku,
Makasai, and Mambai, in addition to Tetum, which serves as
the primary lingua franca. Table 1 presents the language proficiencies
and migration trajectories of the core group of research participants.
All interviewees in this core group were between 20 and
45 years old and had received their education, either entirely
or partially, through the medium of Bahasa Indonesia.
