A total of 42 episodes of group discussion were recorded,
transcribed, and analyzed. Given the sample size and the nature
of the research questions, a quantitative analysis was deemed the
most appropriate method to identify general patterns in the discursive
interactions that emerged within the groups and to assess how
these patterns may have changed over time.
