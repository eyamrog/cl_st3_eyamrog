Data presented in Figure 3 indicate substantial discrepancies among participants
from different countries and regions regarding their perceptions of contextual
factors that may influence the publication process in high-impact computer
science journals. Specifically, 75% of Brazilian participants located in the
South identified co-authorship with a well-known researcher as a significant
influence, while 50% of participants from both the South and
Northeast regions believed that the academic qualifications of researchers affect
the likelihood of paper acceptance. Additionally, interviewees in the Southeast
region considered four out of the five contextual factors examined
to be influential, whereas only a small number of participants
residing abroad identified two factors as influential.
