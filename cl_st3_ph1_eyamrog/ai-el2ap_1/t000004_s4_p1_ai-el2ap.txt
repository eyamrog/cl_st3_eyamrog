Dialect and register frequently intersect, and in the context of
capoeira, the Portuguese language used is characterized by a register
that is deeply influenced by Afro-Brazilian linguistic and cultural elements.
This distinctive register may be subject to criticism from mainstream
perspectives, as evidenced by the remarks of Sophie’s Brazilian acquaintance.
If novice capoeiristas are acquiring this register, the process can
be described, following Agha (2003) and Rhodes, Clonan-Roy, and Wortham
(2020), as one of enregisterment. However, the concept of register
in this context extends beyond purely linguistic features, encompassing the
integration of visual, verbal, musical, embodied, and other semiotic resources
within a complex assemblage. Sophie’s example demonstrates that the expectations
regarding proficiency in Portuguese language and cultural knowledge differ between
beginners and advanced practitioners, with requirements increasing incrementally as individuals
progress in capoeira. This progression is also reflected in instructional
materials published by the Ministério das Relações Exteriores for teaching
Portuguese through capoeira (Ministério das Relações Exteriores, 2020). While beginners
are not expected to have prior knowledge of Portuguese and
typically acquire language skills through repetition of song choruses and
comprehension of simple, movement-accompanied instructions, advanced capoeiristas are expected to
assume the role of lead singer and possess a comprehensive
understanding of the songs’ meanings, including their cultural and historical
significance. Furthermore, advanced practitioners are required to use Portuguese communicatively,
as visiting mestres at capoeira workshops may have limited proficiency
in English or may choose to conduct activities in Portuguese,
both during formal instruction and in informal social interactions that
are integral to capoeira events.
