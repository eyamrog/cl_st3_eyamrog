This exploratory study employs a case study design situated within
a Federal Institute (IF) in a northeastern state of Brazil.
Data were collected using the focus group technique to investigate
teachers' emotions and their responses to emotional demands. Eight focus
groups were conducted, each lasting approximately one hour. Initially, four
focus groups (A, B, C, and D) were held, followed
by an additional four (E, F, G, and H). This
approach was implemented to capture the diversity of training areas
and occupational backgrounds (basic and technical subjects), as well as
different career stages at the IF (beginners with up to
five years of experience and non-beginners with more than five
years of experience). This procedure facilitated the examination of how
these variables influence strategy selection, thereby encompassing a broader range
of experiences and providing a more detailed account of the
strategies employed (see Figure 1). The categorization of career stages
was based on three phases: a) the initial phase of
the teaching career in Brazil (1–5 years), characterized by introductory
formative experiences and adaptation challenges; b) the stabilization phase (5–8
years); and c) the career maturity phase (FERREIRA, 2014).
