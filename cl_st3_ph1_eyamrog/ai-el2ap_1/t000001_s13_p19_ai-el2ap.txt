Small plasmids (<20 kbp) may be underrepresented in Oxford Nanopore
Technologies (ONT) read sets due to limitations in ligation-based library
preparations, where circular DNA molecules may not efficiently acquire sequencing
adapters, or as a result of stringent quality control measures
that exclude shorter reads (e.g., discarding all reads <10 kbp).
This underrepresentation can be mitigated by employing rapid library preparation
protocols and applying less stringent quality control thresholds, such as
discarding only reads shorter than 1 kbp. Alternatively, small plasmids
can be identified and recovered from assembly graphs generated using
Illumina-only or short-read-first hybrid assembly approaches (e.g., Unicycler), where they
typically appear as distinct circular contigs separate from the main
chromosomal assembly (Figure 2A).
