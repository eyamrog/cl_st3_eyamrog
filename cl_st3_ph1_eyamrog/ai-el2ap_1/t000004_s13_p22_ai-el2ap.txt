Sandro stated that the next rhythm would be 'iuna.' I
attempted to recall the name for the purpose of my
fieldnotes, but subsequently needed to verify it online. According to
Sandro, this rhythm is performed for experienced fighters. It is
not intended for intense or aggressive matches, but rather for
games in which participants are expected to connect with one
another and demonstrate mutual respect (Fieldnotes).
