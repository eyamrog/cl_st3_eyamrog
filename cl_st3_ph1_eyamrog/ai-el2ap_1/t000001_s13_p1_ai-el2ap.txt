DNA should be extracted from a single bacterial colony to
minimize the risk of genomic heterogeneity (see Pitfalls). The optimal
DNA extraction method may vary depending on the organism; however,
the primary objectives should be to maximize both DNA purity
and molecular weight. High purity is essential for optimal Oxford
Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing yields, as chemical and biological contaminants
can damage or obstruct nanopores, thereby reducing the lifespan of
flow cells. High molecular weight DNA enables the generation of
longer ONT reads; therefore, vortexing, excessive handling or pipetting, and
repeated freeze-thaw cycles should be avoided to minimize DNA shearing.
For most bacteria, extraction protocols should include cell lysis by
enzymatic digestion, typically using lysozyme (Sigma Aldrich, L6876) followed by
proteinase K digestion, as provided in commercial DNA extraction kits.
This approach is generally effective for both Gram-negative and Gram-positive
bacteria, although additional enzymatic steps may be necessary for species
that are resistant to lysis. Magnetic bead-based DNA extraction methods
are recommended to further reduce DNA shearing and increase throughput.
The preferred kits are GenFind V3 (Beckman Coulter, C34881) and
MagAttract HMW DNA (Qiagen, 67563). For bacterial isolates that are
refractory to enzymatic lysis, bead-beating can be employed, although this
may result in reduced ONT read lengths.
