Social media sharing platforms such as YouTube, Vimeo, and SoundCloud
(see Figure 2) enable the distribution of video and audio
files to various audiences, including communities and individual users, by
making content readily accessible through online search engines. These platforms
support rights management by allowing uploaders to select between traditional
copyright and Creative Commons licensing options. However, the majority of
users lack adequate knowledge of both traditional copyright and Creative
Commons licenses, which may hinder their ability to make informed
choices regarding rights management. Additionally, these platforms offer graded access
controls, permitting users to designate content as either private or
public.
