These rituals can be understood in relation to candombl√©; however,
many capoeiristas perceive them more generally as expressions of recognition
for the authority of the roda leader and as demonstrations
of mutual respect among participants. According to Tiago, these gestures
exemplify the values of respect and non-competitiveness that are central
to capoeira.
