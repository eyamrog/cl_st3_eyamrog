The cell is approximately 1.1 times longer than broad or
nearly as long as broad, with a deep median constriction
and a linear sinus. Semicells are trapezoidal with a truncate
apex and rounded angles. The cell wall is punctate. Each
cell contains two chloroplasts, with two pyrenoids present in each
semicell. Cell dimensions are as follows: length 31.6–45.5 µm, width
31.2–43 µm, and isthmus 10.8–14.3 µm.
