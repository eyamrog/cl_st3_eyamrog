Within this context, the OLIVA project (Latin American Observatory of
eVAluation Indicators) was established as an initiative of the Centro
de Estudios de la Circulación del Conocimiento (CECIC-Facultad de Ciencias
Políticas y Sociales), and received approval and funding from the
Universidad Nacional de Cuyo in early 2019. The primary objective
of the project is to enhance the visibility of scientific
output published in the region and to develop indicators that
facilitate the recognition of the value of these journals for
the evaluation of individual academic careers and institutions. During the
first phase of the project, collaboration was established with the
SciELO/FAPESP Program of Brazil, Redalyc at the Universidad Autónoma del
Estado de México (UAEM, Mexico), and the Consejo Latinoamericano de
Ciencias Sociales (CLACSO). The outcomes of this initial phase are
presented in this paper. The second phase aims to incorporate
documents from journals indexed in Latindex Catalog 2.0 and Biblat,
and a pilot project involving these institutions is currently in
progress.
