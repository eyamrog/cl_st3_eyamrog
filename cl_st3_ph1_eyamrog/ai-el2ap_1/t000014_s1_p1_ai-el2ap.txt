As an increasing number of the world’s languages become endangered,
their documentation serves as a critical resource for both linguists
and language communities. Documentary linguists rely on digital archives to
ensure the preservation, conservation, and accessibility of the materials resulting
from their work. This article examines the benefits and challenges
associated with archiving in language documentation, with particular attention to
issues of preservation, conservation, access, ownership, and the use of
materials. Drawing on our experience as scholars involved in the
administration, contribution to, and use of language archives—especially those related
to the indigenous languages of Latin America—we focus on the
specific context of language archiving in Brazil and its implications
for researchers, community members, and other stakeholders. The discussion addresses
the necessary steps to ensure the quality and longevity of
archived resources, the principles and strategies for making materials accessible,
and the ways in which language archives can support ongoing
work with indigenous languages. Overall, language archives constitute essential resources
for both scholars and communities seeking to revitalize, maintain, or
document their linguistic and cultural heritage.
