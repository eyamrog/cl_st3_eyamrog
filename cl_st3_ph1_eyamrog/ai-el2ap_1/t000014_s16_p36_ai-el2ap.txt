Researchers who work with speakers of indigenous languages frequently possess
substantial documentary collections, including field notes, audio recordings, photographs, and
films, which are often stored in personal or informal settings
that may expose them to risks such as humidity, insect
damage, or flooding. These legacy materials, regardless of their quantity,
hold significant linguistic, cultural, historical, and personal value for both
individuals and broader communities. In the case of less well-documented
languages, such materials may represent the only extant early records
of language use, as well as other aspects of community
life. Unlike widely spoken languages such as Portuguese, for which
historical records are readily accessible, the historical documentation of many
indigenous languages often survives solely due to dedicated efforts to
archive these legacy materials. As Austin (2017, p. 23) notes,
“For projects interested in documenting, describing or revitalizing languages, especially
endangered languages, historically existing materials (whether digital or analog) like
tape recordings made in earlier times or written materials collected
years or even centuries ago may exist and may represent
important sources of information, indeed, in some cases, the only
information available.” Linguists have a professional obligation to identify and,
when feasible, collaborate with communities to preserve relevant legacy materials
for the benefit of linguistics, related disciplines, and future generations.
This preservation enables subsequent philological analysis of the documentary record,
acknowledging the documentary lineage inherent in all linguistic data as
they are recorded, interpreted, and analyzed over time (Goddard, 1973,
p. 727). Additionally, linguists must ensure that their work with
legacy materials adheres to ethical standards (O’Meara and Good, 2010;
see also §4 above).
