The ginga constitutes a period of relative calm during which
capoeiristas assess their opponent’s vulnerabilities and prepare for potential attacks.
This phase alternates with active movements, including offensive and defensive
actions. During class practice outside the roda, both Sandro and
Mestre João commonly signal the transition from ginga to action
by clapping their hands. Similarly, Mestre João uses a hand
clap to indicate the shift from the theoretical to the
practical segment of the class. The execution of movements is
synchronized with the music, particularly during transitional moments such as
the ginga between attacks.
