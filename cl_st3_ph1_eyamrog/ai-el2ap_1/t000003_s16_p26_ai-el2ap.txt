All the football club names analyzed were compound names incorporating
elements from a regional language, Tetum, Portuguese, or English. Additionally,
the use of the acronyms FC and AS reflected established
conventions in international football leagues. The acronym FC, which precedes
the club name, aligns with the word order typical of
Portuguese league club names, although it indexes the Anglophone world
and, according to a club organizer, stands for the English
term "Football Club." In contrast, AS is an acronym frequently
used in the Italian football league (e.g., AS Milan), but
according to one interviewee, it represents the Portuguese word "Associação"
(Association). For members of AS Bidau, this acronym thus indexes
the Portuguese football tradition, which is closely followed in Timor-Leste.
