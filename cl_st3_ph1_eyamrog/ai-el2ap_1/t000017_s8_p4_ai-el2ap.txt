From this perspective, several researchers have contributed to the integration
of these concepts (Flores et al., 2012; Manga & Ramos,
2006; Matute et al., 2007) and have identified three key
requirements for developing tests for children: (1) the assessment of
neuropsychological skills as indicators of the maturation and functioning of
specific developing brain structures, (2) the selection of appropriate procedures
for test and item design that are suitable for the
relevant cultural context (for example, the go-no go procedure has
been widely employed in the development of attention tests across
various cultural settings), and (3) the interpretation of results using
either normative comparisons (comparing the individual to a reference group)
and/or criterion-based comparisons (evaluating the individual against a predefined objective).
