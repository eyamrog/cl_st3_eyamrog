Both languages are classified within the Arawakan family (Payne, 1991;
Aikhenvald, 1999; Ramirez, 2001). Brandão, Carvalho, and Pereira (2018), as
well as Pereira (2018), provide evidence that Enawene Nawe (EN)
and Paresi are closely related and, together with the Saraveka
language, constitute a subgroup referred to as Juruena. In earlier
classifications of the Arawakan family, only Fabre (2005) proposed a
close relationship between Paresi and Enawene Nawe, while Payne (1991)
grouped Paresi with Waurá in a Central group, and Aikhenvald
(1999) classified Paresi with the Xingu languages in a ‘Paresi-Xingu’
branch.
