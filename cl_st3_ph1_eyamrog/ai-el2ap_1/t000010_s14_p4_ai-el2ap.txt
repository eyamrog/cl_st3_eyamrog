The Luria Inicial neuropsychological battery is designed to assess four
cognitive domains in children aged 4 to 6 years: executive
function, language, processing speed, and memory, as well as manual
lateralization (Ramírez et al., 2015). The battery consists of 14
tests, which are organized as follows: the executive domain includes
tests 1 to 5 (manual dexterity, right-left orientation, manual gestures
and orofacial praxis, verbal control of motor acts, and reproduction
of visuospatial patterns); the linguistic domain comprises tests 6 to
10 (visual perception of objects and sets of drawings for
naming, phonemic hearing, vocabulary in images, reasoning by verbal analogy,
and numerical operations); the processing speed domain includes tests 11
and 12 (rapid naming of pictures and colors); and the
learning and memory domain consists of tests 13 and 14
(verbal memory and visual memory). Manual laterality is assessed through
measures of preference, speed, and manual recognition to determine the
degree of cerebral hemisphere specialization. In the present study, the
Cuban normative guidelines were applied (Ramírez et al., 2015).
