The use of ICT in contextual TSA has primarily been
applied to data analysis, as most CEAP courses reported in
the literature are implemented locally, enabling instructors to investigate the
target discourse community on site. For instance, Dehnad et al.
(2010) utilized computer software (SPSS) to analyze data obtained from
questionnaires administered to graduate students at a medical and management
university, as well as from interviews with department heads, students,
and a senior university administrator, in order to revise the
syllabus of a CEAP course.
