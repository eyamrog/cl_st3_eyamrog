Biomechanical parameters were assessed by calculating stem bending stiffness using
a universal testing machine (MBioI, Biopdi, São Paulo, Brazil) equipped
with a 5 N force transducer and operated at a
constant speed of 1 mm min⁻¹. A three-point bending test
was applied to each stem segment in accordance with the
protocols described by Vincent (1990b) and Rowe & Speck (1996).
Previous analyses indicated that the shear effect is minimized in
this wood species when the span-to-depth ratio exceeds 20 (see
Supplementary Material Figure S1). Consequently, the span-to-depth ratio was standardized
to 30 to further reduce shear effects, following the recommendations
of Vincent (1990b) and Gerolamo et al. (2020). Displacement-force curves
for each measurement interval were recorded using MBioI software integrated
with the testing machine. Stem samples were positioned on two
vertical supports with a small displacement (2 mm) to ensure
that measurements remained within the elastic range and to minimize
shear influence. Each bending test lasted approximately five minutes. Flexural
stiffness (EI, in N mm²) for each segment was calculated
using the formula EI = l³ß / 48, where l
(mm) is the distance between supports and ß (N mm⁻¹)
is the slope of the best-fit regression of the displacement-force
curve (R² > 0.98). The axial second moment of area
(I, in mm⁴) was determined using diameter measurements at three
positions along each segment (midpoint and approximately 15 mm from
each end), approximating the cross-sectional shape as an ellipse with
the formula I = πa³b / 4, where a (mm)
is the vertical radial diameter and b (mm) is the
diameter perpendicular to the applied force. Structural Young’s modulus (E,
in MN m⁻²) was then calculated as EI / I
for each sample at each sampling time (every 4 hours),
resulting in a total of 13 measurements per stem sample.
