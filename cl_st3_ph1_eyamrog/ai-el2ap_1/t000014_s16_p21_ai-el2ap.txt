In 2011, Rosés Labrada visited several Mako communities along the
Ventuari River and its tributaries to obtain community consent for
the proposed research project. In accordance with local protocols, village
meetings were conducted in multiple communities, resulting in invitations to
conduct further work in Arena Blanca and San José de
Yureva. No data collection occurred during this initial visit. The
documentation project formally commenced in July 2012, with Arena Blanca
selected as the site for the first field stay due
to its status as a predominantly Mako-speaking community.
