Although Portuguese is the primary language of instruction in Brazilian
universities, the increasing influence of globalization has led to a
growing requirement for students to read and write in English,
which functions as the academic lingua franca (Ferreira & Lousada,
2016). For instance, applicants to computer science graduate programs at
most public universities in Brazil are required to pass an
English proficiency examination that assesses their ability to comprehend academic
texts. Furthermore, after admission, graduate students are typically required to
publish at least one article in high-impact journals as a
condition for obtaining their postgraduate degree (Vieira, 2015a). Nevertheless, few
institutions provide English writing courses aimed at developing studentsâ€™ academic
literacy skills (Aranha, 2009). In response to this gap, online
courses in English for Academic Purposes (CEAP) have been proposed
as a means to offer accessible preparation for academic writing
and communication.
