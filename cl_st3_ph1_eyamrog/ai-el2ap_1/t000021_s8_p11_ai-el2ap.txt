The literature review indicates that existing research has predominantly focused
on the processes by which teachers regulate their emotions, with
limited attention given to identifying which specific emotions are regulated
and the underlying reasons for such regulation. Consequently, there is
insufficient understanding of the particular emotions that are elicited in
classroom settings across various situations. Additionally, most studies have emphasized
intrapersonal aspects of emotion regulation, often overlooking the interpersonal and
contextual factors that may influence teachers' emotional experiences and regulatory
strategies. The literature has also not sufficiently addressed the outcomes
of emotion regulation or the sequential use of multiple regulatory
strategies. Frield et al. (2015) highlight the need for further
investigation into the dynamic and context-dependent nature of emotion regulation
within educational environments. These gaps in the literature provide the
rationale for the present study, which seeks to address the
following research question: How do teachers in vocational and technological
education regulate their emotions in response to the diverse emotional
demands encountered in the classroom? The objective of this study
is to characterize the emotional labor of vocational and technological
education teachers by examining both the emotions they experience and
the emotion regulation strategies they employ in response to classroom
demands.
