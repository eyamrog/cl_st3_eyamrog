Although stylistic variations exist, capoeira is generally practiced at a
relatively close distance between participants. The two players remain in
close proximity but rarely make physical contact. Instead, they evade
each other's attacks while simultaneously seeking to position themselves advantageously
for potential offensive actions. In most cases, attacks are intentionally
left incomplete.
