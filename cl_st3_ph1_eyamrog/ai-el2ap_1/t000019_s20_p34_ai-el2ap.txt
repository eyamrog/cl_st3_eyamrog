More than 90% of Brazilians' use of digital information and
communication technologies (DICT) is associated with everyday activities, primarily limited
to instant messaging and social media posting (CGI.br, 2019a). This
pattern is closely related to the widespread use of mobile
phones and does not necessarily indicate adequate technical proficiency or
contribute significantly to the comprehensive intellectual development of individuals. Therefore,
access to mobile phones should not be interpreted as evidence
of progress in information technology skills, nor should it be
assumed to reflect a substantive understanding of the devices' functionalities.
