Google Scholar data provides additional insight into JUOJS by supplying
article-level citation information, although this data is organized by OJS
installation domain rather than by individual journal. As of June
2022, 22,679 JUOJS were indexed in Google Scholar and distributed
across 8,548 OJS domains, with an average of 2.7 journals
per domain. For each identified domain, the first page of
search results was examined, typically including citation counts for approximately
the ten most-cited articles (see Figure 10). Analysis showed that
34 domains (0.4%) had more than 10,000 citations among their
top ten articles, 565 domains (6.6%) had more than 1,000
citations, and 1,015 domains (11.9%) had more than 500 citations.
Conversely, 547 domains (6.4%) had no citations among the articles
listed on the first page. The overall mean number of
citations for the first page of Google Scholar search results
per JUOJS was 358.8, with a median of 50.0.
