There is evidence that suppression is the emotion regulation strategy
most frequently employed by teachers (e.g., Taxer & Gross, 2018).
In the present study, suppression emerged as the most common
reactive strategy, typically used to avoid or resolve interpersonal conflicts.
These results highlight the significance of suppression in teaching and
support previous findings indicating that suppression is not inherently detrimental
in this context and may be beneficial in the short
term (English et al., 2017), which may account for its
high prevalence. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the
literature generally characterizes suppression as maladaptive, primarily due to its
association with burnout (e.g., Chang, 2013; Yin, 2016). Furthermore, suppression
has been shown to impede interpersonal closeness (Gross, 2014), which
is a critical aspect of teacher-student relationship quality (Taxer &
Frenzel, 2015). Consistent with the findings of Akbari et al.
(2017) and Sutton (2004), the most frequently reported suppression tactics
in this study were masking (concealing genuine emotion and displaying
another), expressive neutrality, remaining silent, and temporarily leaving the room.
