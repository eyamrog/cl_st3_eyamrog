It is important to note that these findings on classroom
interaction were obtained without providing any discursive extracts to the
reader. In some instances, researchers include only brief extracts to
demonstrate the application of their coding scheme, rather than as
integral components of the analysis. Consequently, the results rely entirely
on the explanatory capacity of the codes and the reliability
of the coding process. Furthermore, given the nature of the
research questions, a qualitative approach would not provide the level
of generalizability required for descriptive purposes, nor the objectivity necessary
to compare changes in discursive variables over time.
