Hyland (2007) notes that initial research concentrated on the lexical
and syntactic characteristics of specific registers, while subsequent studies shifted
attention to the rhetorical macro-structure of specialized texts. More recently,
there has been an increased focus on understanding language use
within particular discourse communities, with the aim of describing the
specific target texts that learners are required to produce. Such
investigations typically involve analysis of either experienced community members, the
genres they produce and consume, or both.
