The concept of “intellectual imperialism,” as articulated by Syed Hussein
Alatas at the University of Malaya in the late 1960s
(2000), has contributed to the development of the “academic dependency”
theory, which is pertinent to this study. Syed Farid Alatas,
a leading scholar in this area affiliated with the National
University of Singapore and the University of Malaya, identifies several
forms of dependency affecting researchers in the Global South. Among
these is a “dependency on recognition,” which compels many scholars
to choose between meeting the publication requirements of high-ranking international
journals, particularly those indexed in the Web of Science, and
publishing locally in their native languages (2022, p. 20). The
JUOJS demonstrate a partial departure from this recognition dependency, aligning
with the objective described by Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o to decentralize
academic authority from the West and promote a plurality of
intellectual centers across diverse cultures, a process Thiong'o characterizes as
integral to a broader decolonization effort (1991, pp. xiv, 3).
