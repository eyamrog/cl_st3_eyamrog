The removal of vegetation cover for road construction can lead
to a reduction in plant biodiversity, necessitating the implementation of
mitigation measures to minimize this impact (Stumpf et al. 2008).
One such measure involves relocating plant species removed from areas
designated for road works to conservation sites where these species
naturally occur (Araújo 2006). The importance of transplanting species from
areas subject to vegetation removal to other suitable locations has
been emphasized by Primack (2008), Guardia et al. (2021), and
Suzuki et al. (2021), with recommendations for this practice also
provided by Jasper et al. (2005) and Duarte and Gandolfi
(2013), particularly in the context of protected areas (Santos Júnior
& Tamaki 2014).
