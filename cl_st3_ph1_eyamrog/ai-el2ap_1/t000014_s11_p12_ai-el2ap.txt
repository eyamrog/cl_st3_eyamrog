Once the materials and metadata are archived, they become accessible
to their creators, collaborators, other researchers, members of the language
community, and any other individuals who may require access to
the data. In addition, digital language archives are designed to
facilitate the discoverability of materials, enabling users to efficiently locate
the resources they seek. Discoverability is important for both internal
searches within the archive—such as faceted, targeted, or advanced searches—and
for external searches conducted through broader internet platforms, including Google
indexing and metadata harvesting by the Open Language Archives Community
(OLAC).
