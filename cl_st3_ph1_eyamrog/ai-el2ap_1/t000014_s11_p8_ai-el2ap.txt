Although the aforementioned archives encompass a broad range of geographic
regions and collection criteria, they may not be suitable for
all language documentation projects. Alternative options include digital data repositories
maintained by various universities. Linguistic datasets, excluding primary data from
language documentation, may be deposited in the Troms√∏ Repository of
Language and Linguistics (TROLLing, https://site.uit.no/trolling/about/). Both primary and secondary data,
as well as datasets, can be archived in general-purpose repositories
such as Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/) and the Harvard DataVerse (https://dataverse.harvard.edu/). Further
options are available in the Registry of Research Data Repositories
(https://www.re3data.org/).
