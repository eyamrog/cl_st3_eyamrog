The community-wide meeting held on July 15 was attended by
a substantial number of community adults, who participated in discussions
regarding the project and the potential ethical concerns associated with
recording and archiving audiovisual materials. As the primary purpose of
the meeting was to seek permission for recording, no recordings
of the meeting were made. Nevertheless, significant progress was achieved
in the permission-seeking process during this meeting.
