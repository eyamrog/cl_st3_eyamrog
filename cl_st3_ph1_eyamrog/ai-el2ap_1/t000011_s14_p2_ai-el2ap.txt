Ten straight stem segments, each approximately 20 cm in length
and 5–10 mm in diameter, were selected for biomechanical testing.
Stem samples exhibiting a tapering percentage greater than 10% were
excluded from the study (Rowe et al. 2005). Additionally, ten
mature sun leaves without visible herbivory marks or damage were
collected from the same individual. All stem and leaf samples
were initially weighed using a precision balance and subsequently tested
to determine their structural Young’s modulus and fracture toughness under
natural (time 0) conditions. To assess the effects of dehydration
on the biomechanical properties of stems and leaves, a 48-hour
experiment was conducted in which the hydric status of the
samples was manipulated. The stem and leaf samples were randomly
and evenly assigned to one of two hydric conditions: (i)
samples maintained in a moist environment using trays covered with
wet tissue paper, and (ii) samples subjected to gradual dehydration
through natural moisture loss to the air. Throughout the experiment,
samples were weighed every four hours and subjected to biomechanical
testing.
