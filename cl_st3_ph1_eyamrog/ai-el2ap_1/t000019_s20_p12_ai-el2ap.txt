knowledge and skills to participate effectively in a rapidly changing
society, to prepare them for professions that may not yet

and to address problems that are not yet identified. Evidence
suggests that the majority of future professions will involve, either
directly or indirectly, computing and digital technologies (BNCC, 2017, p.
473).
