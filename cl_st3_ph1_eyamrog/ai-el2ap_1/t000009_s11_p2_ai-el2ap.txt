Language teaching and learning, like other forms of social practice,
constitute a complex system whose outcomes are determined by the
interaction of multiple elements (Larsen-Freeman, 1997). These elements include participants,
the target language, the language of instruction, studentsâ€™ native languages,
instructional materials, tasks, assessment tools, theoretical frameworks for language and
teaching, the target discourse community, as well as institutional and
economic constraints. Each of these components is itself a complex
system arising from the interaction of additional factors. For instance,
languages are shaped by social, cultural, and ideological processes that
result from the interactions among individuals and artifacts within a
given society.
