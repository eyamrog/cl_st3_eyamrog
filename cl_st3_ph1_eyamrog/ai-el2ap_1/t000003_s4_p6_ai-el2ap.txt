The only publicly available data on recent migration to Northern
Ireland, UK, cited in this study, is sourced from the
article by Doyle and McAreavey (2010), which is included in
the References. The interviews conducted with Timorese migrants are not
publicly accessible, as these materials contain sensitive information that could
potentially compromise the privacy and safety of the research participants.
