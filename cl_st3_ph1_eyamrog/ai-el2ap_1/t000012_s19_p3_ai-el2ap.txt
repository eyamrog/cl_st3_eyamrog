Based on the data from Sazima et al. (2012) and
Mikula et al. (2017), we reconstructed the cleaning interaction networks
for Brazil (Pantanal) and Africa, utilizing a heat map to
illustrate the diet diversity index for each bird species (Fig.
4). In these networks, node size corresponds to the degree
of centrality, with larger nodes indicating bird species that interact
with a greater diversity of host species.
