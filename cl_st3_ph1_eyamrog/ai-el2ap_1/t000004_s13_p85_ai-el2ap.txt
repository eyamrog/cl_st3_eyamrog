Nicknames: In certain capoeira schools, though not universally, students are
assigned nicknames, typically in Portuguese. The majority of mestres are
also known by such nicknames. The practice of using nicknames
originated during the period when capoeira was illegal, as concealing
the true identity of practitioners helped protect them from potential
arrest.
