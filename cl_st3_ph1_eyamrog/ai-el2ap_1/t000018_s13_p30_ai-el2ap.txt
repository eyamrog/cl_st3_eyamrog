Motor performance encompasses the preferential use of one hand for
performing actions or recognizing objects by touch, as well as
the manner in which a pencil or coloring tool is
gripped. It also includes the positioning and grip of the
fingers when holding objects or executing tasks. Additional aspects involve
the speed, coordination, and quality of self-care activities such as
dressing, eating, and bathing, as well as the execution of
physical education exercises. Furthermore, facial gestures serve as indicators for
analyzing the function of language-related organs, including facial expressions, cheek
puffing, laughter, and the use of the tongue for speaking,
producing animal sounds, or simulating trumpeting.
