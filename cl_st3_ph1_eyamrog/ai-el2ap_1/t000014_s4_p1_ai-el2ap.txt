Brazil and its neighboring regions exhibit some of the highest
levels of linguistic diversity globally. Approximately 300 indigenous languages are
spoken in South America, with more than half of these
found within Brazil (Moore, 2007; Galucio, Moore, and Van der
Voort, 2018, p. 195), a situation recognized by UNESCOâ€™s International
Decade of Indigenous Languages, which coincides with the period of
this study. However, this current linguistic diversity represents only a
small proportion of the languages that existed in South America
prior to European contact, and processes of language shift and
loss have persisted to the present. Nearly 80 of the
remaining 300 languages are now classified as critically endangered (Moore,
2007). The decline of indigenous languages in Brazil has continued
despite initiatives such as Decreto n. 7.387 (2010), which established
the National Inventory of Linguistic Diversity (INDL), a governmental program
aimed at surveying languages and designating them as intangible cultural
heritage (Galucio, Moore, and Van der Voort, 2018). Currently, the
majority of indigenous languages in Brazil and other parts of
South America remain insufficiently described and documented, with approximately half
having only minimal archival records.
