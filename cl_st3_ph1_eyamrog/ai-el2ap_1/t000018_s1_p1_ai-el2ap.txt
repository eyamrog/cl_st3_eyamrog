Introduction. Luria's theory provides a framework for analyzing psychological development
following brain injury in both adults and children. Objective. This
study aims to analyze the content of a selection of
articles that evaluate preschool children using Luria's theoretical approach, with
the goal of relating these evaluations to the principles of
early childhood education. Methodology. Articles published between 2015 and 2022
were selected using various search queries across eight databases: SCOPUS,
WOS, SCIELO, PUBMED, DIALNET, LATINDEX, SCIENCEGATE, and EBSCO. Results. The
work of Luria and his followers has facilitated the use
of neuropsychological factors as indicators for assessing neurological alterations in
humans. The review of the selected articles indicates that Luria's
theoretical contributions align with the objectives of early childhood education,
particularly in supporting comprehensive assessment approaches. Based on this perspective,
the authors propose five procedures for analyzing the holistic development
of preschool children. Conclusions. Luria's theory is applicable in early
childhood education for conducting comprehensive assessments of preschool children.
