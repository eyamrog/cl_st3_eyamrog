The cell is approximately 1.4 times longer than it is
broad, with a pronounced median constriction and a widely open
sinus. The semicells are trapezoidal, featuring a truncate apex, slightly
convex apical angles, and rounded basal angles. The cell wall
is punctate. Each cell contains a single chloroplast, with one
pyrenoid present per semicell. Cell dimensions are as follows: length
approximately 26.2 µm, width approximately 18.8 µm, and isthmus approximately
5.0 µm.
