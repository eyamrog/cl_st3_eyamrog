At the municipal level across the state, there was a
positive correlation between the rate of rapid tests and incidence,
as well as between the rate of RT-PCR tests and
incidence. Additionally, the rates of RT-PCR testing and mortality were
positively correlated and were more concentrated in three health macro-regions:
Central, Central South, and Northern Triangle. Furthermore, a significant negative
correlation was observed between time and test rates at both
the municipal and regional levels.
