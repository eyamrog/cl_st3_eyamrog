Frequencies of taxon occurrence were calculated following the methods described
by Dajoz (1973) and Zak and Willig (2004), by dividing
the number of samples in which each species was recorded
by the total number of samples analyzed, and multiplying the
result by 100 to obtain a percentage. Fungal taxa were
then classified into constancy categories as follows: Constant (C) for
frequencies ≥ 50%, Accessory (A) for frequencies ≥ 25% and
< 50%, and Occasional (O) for frequencies < 25%.
