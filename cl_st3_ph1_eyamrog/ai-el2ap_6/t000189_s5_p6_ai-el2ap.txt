Qi et al. [31], in a survey involving 684 Chinese
children aged 5 months to 12 years, found that vitamin
A deficiency (retinol <0.2 mg/L) was associated with an increased
risk of developing acute respiratory tract infection (p<0.05). However, these
findings should be interpreted with caution, as vitamin A concentrations
are known to decrease during infectious conditions as a result
of the acute phase response, which may confound the observed
association [32].
