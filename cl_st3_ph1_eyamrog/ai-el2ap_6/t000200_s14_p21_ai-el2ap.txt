The outcome variable in this study is the number of
monthly cases of leptospirosis. Monthly incidence rates were calculated for
each group of months within the study period. To account
for potential variations in age structure and gender when comparing
different periods, direct rate standardization was applied, using the population
of Santa Catarina in 2010 as the reference. The analysis
presents the number of leptospirosis cases, the monthly average, and
the incidence rate for the period studied. Non-standardized rates were
reported when a significant correlation (r > 0.90) was observed
between raw and standardized rates, as these were considered to
retain the original values and provide greater representativeness and interpretability.
