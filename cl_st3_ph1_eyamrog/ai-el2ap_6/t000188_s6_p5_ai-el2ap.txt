In addition, the results of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) tests often require more than 15 days to
be released in many regions of the country. This delay
contributes to underreporting of cases, limits the diagnosis of asymptomatic
individuals or those with mild symptoms who do not seek
medical attention or lack access to healthcare facilities, and hinders
the timely identification of cases at higher risk of progressing
to severe forms of COVID-19.
