The biochemical profile of vitamin D in patients diagnosed with
COVID-19 has not yet been fully characterized. Therefore, assessing vitamin
D concentrations in baseline blood samples may provide valuable information
regarding the potential association between vitamin D status and COVID-19
prognosis, and may help to evaluate the possible therapeutic role
of vitamin D in the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
