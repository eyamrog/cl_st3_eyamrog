The participants in this survey had significantly less experience with
open peer review compared to those in Ross-Hellauer et al.
(2017) and were also somewhat younger. Additionally, the present survey
sampled individuals from a small medical specialty in a middle-income
Latin American country, who are likely more familiar with open
access journals and double-blind peer review. In contrast, participants in
Ross-Hellauer et al. (2017) were predominantly from the natural sciences
in Europe and were generally more accustomed to single-blind peer
review. This survey likely included fewer, if any, participants from
the publishing industry; however, this information was not collected in
order to maintain participant anonymity.
