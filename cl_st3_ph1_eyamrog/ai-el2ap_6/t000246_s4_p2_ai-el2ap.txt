Bibliometric analysis techniques offer benefits to researchers through both quantitative
and qualitative approaches. Quantitative data provide an initial overview of
research trends and patterns, while the integration of qualitative analysis
allows for a more comprehensive and representative understanding of the
subject matter. Consequently, bibliometric studies facilitate the visualization of connections
among information across various fields of knowledge.
