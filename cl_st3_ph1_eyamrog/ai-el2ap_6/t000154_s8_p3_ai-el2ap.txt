“Open peer review” is a collective term for various peer
review models that align with the principles of open science
(Ross-Hellauer, 2017; Tennant et al., 2017; Wolfram et al., 2020).
Ross-Hellauer (2017) identified 122 definitions of open peer review, which
involve different combinations of seven key characteristics: open identities, where
authors and reviewers are aware of each other’s identities; open
reports, where review reports are published alongside the article; open
participation, where the broader community can contribute to the review
process; open interaction, where direct reciprocal discussion between authors and
reviewers, or among reviewers, is permitted and encouraged; open pre-review
manuscripts, where manuscripts are made publicly available (e.g., via preprint
servers such as arXiv) prior to formal peer review; open
final version commenting, where review or commentary is allowed on
the final published version; and open platforms (also referred to
as “decoupled review”), where the review process is managed by
an entity separate from the publication venue. Among these, open
identities and open reports are most frequently included in definitions
of open peer review and are therefore considered core characteristics
(Ross-Hellauer, 2017). For detailed analyses of how each characteristic addresses
specific limitations of traditional peer review and their alignment with
different schools of open science, see Ross-Hellauer (2017); for reviews
of the empirical evidence supporting various open peer review traits,
see Ross-Hellauer (2017), Tennant et al. (2017), and Bruce et
al. (2016). In the Global North, the adoption of open
peer review is primarily driven by “born open” journals in
the natural sciences and medicine (Tennant et al., 2017; Wolfram
et al., 2020), while in the Global South, the SciELO
Network is a significant organization promoting the implementation of open
peer review.
