The results demonstrated that female gender was associated with higher
levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. This observation is consistent
with previous research, which has repeatedly identified a relationship between
female gender and elevated psychological distress (Olagoke, Olagoke, & Hughes,
2020; Maza et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Qio
et al., 2020). Similarly, the "Mental Health in the UK
and COVID-19" report found that being female and younger were
both associated with increased depression, anxiety, and stress during the
pandemic (Jia et al., 2020).
