During field sampling at each site, 10 leaves were collected
from submerged mixed leaf litter at a depth of approximately
30 cm using sterilized tweezers. The collected leaves, along with
water from the sampling location, were placed in pre-sterilized 200
mL polyethylene bottles. A total of 72 samples were obtained
throughout the study and subsequently transported to the laboratory for
further analysis.
