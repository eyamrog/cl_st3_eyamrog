Furthermore, our case tested positive for lupus anticoagulant. In contrast,
Zhang et al.11 recently reported three cases of COVID-19 that
exhibited thrombotic events, specifically multiple cerebral infarctions, in association with
antiphospholipid antibodies. However, those cases were negative for lupus anticoagulant
and instead tested positive for anti-cardiolipin IgA as well as
anti–β2-glycoprotein-I IgA and IgG antibodies.
