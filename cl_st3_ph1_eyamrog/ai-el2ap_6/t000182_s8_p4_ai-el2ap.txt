The genus Belminus (Bolboderini) is one of the least studied
groups of triatomines and comprises the following species: Belminus corredori
Galv찾o & Angulo, 2006; Belminus costaricensis Herrer, Lent & Wygodzinsky,
1954; Belminus ferroae Sandoval, Pab처n, Jurberg & Galv찾o, 2007; Belminus
herreri Lent & Wygodzinsky, 1979; Belminus laportei Lent, Jurberg &
Carcavallo, 1995; Belminus peruvianus Herrer, Lent & Wygodzinsky, 1954; Belminus
pittieri Osuna & Ayala, 1993; and Belminus rugulosus St책l, 1859.
The geographical distribution of these relatively small triatomines is discontinuous
and is based on a limited number of specimens collected
in Central America, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, and northern Brazil. B.
peruvianus, B. herreri, and B. ferroae have been reported as
vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi within human dwellings in Peru and
Colombia (Sandoval et al. 2010). Knowledge about the genus Belminus
remains limited, partly due to the difficulty of maintaining these
species in laboratory conditions. Recent studies have begun to elucidate
the feeding behavior of Belminus species, with evidence indicating that
they rely on invertebrate hemolymph to complete their life cycle.
Although they are facultative blood feeders, they are capable of
surviving exclusively on the fluids of other arthropods. Research by
Sandoval et al. (2004, 2010) on B. herreri and B.
ferroae identified cockroaches (Blattodea: Blaberidae) as the principal hosts in
domestic environments, although adults may occasionally feed on humans. In
these studies, B. herreri and B. ferroae were collected from
houses where cockroaches were present; more than 86% of the
intestinal contents tested positive for Periplaneta americana antiserum, while only
a small proportion reacted to human blood antisera. Furthermore, Sandoval
et al. (2013) demonstrated that B. ferroae exhibited higher fitness
when feeding on Blaberus cockroaches compared to mice, indicating a
greater adaptation to invertebrate hosts.
