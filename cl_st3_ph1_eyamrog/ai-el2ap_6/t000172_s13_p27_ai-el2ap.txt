SARS-CoV ORF7a and ORF3a proteins have been shown to block
G0/G1 cell cycle progression by reducing cyclin D3 expression, decreasing
cyclin D/CDK4/6 activity, and inhibiting Rb phosphorylation (Yuan et al.
2006). Additionally, Nsp15 can alter the subcellular localization and function
of Rb, promote pRb ubiquitination and degradation, and increase the
proportion of cells in S-phase. In contrast, overexpression of the
ORF4 (3b) protein induces cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 and
promotes apoptosis (Yuan et al. 2005; Bhardwaj et al. 2012).
