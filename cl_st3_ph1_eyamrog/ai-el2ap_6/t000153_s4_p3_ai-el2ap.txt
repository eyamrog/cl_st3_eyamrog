The establishment of the Network represents the successful navigation of
challenges faced by both the group and the organization in
collaborating with other professionals, resulting in increased visibility. The collected
reports demonstrate a clear understanding of the consequences of silencing,
which can lead to isolation and the perpetuation of social
discredit. Membership in the Network strengthens professional identity by enabling
mutual support among professionals and facilitating collective efforts to counteract
potential discredit.
