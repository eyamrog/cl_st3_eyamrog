Various strategies to inhibit viral binding have been explored. Human
recombinant ACE2 has been shown to reduce SARS-CoV-2 recovery in
vitro and to protect mice from acute lung injury induced
by SARS-CoV (Monteil et al., 2020). Additionally, a chimeric protein
consisting of the extracellular domain of ACE2 fused to the
Fc region of IgG1 demonstrated favorable pharmacological properties in mice
(Lei et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 can enter host cells via
two primary mechanisms: endocytosis through endosomes or direct membrane fusion.
Arbidol, a broad-spectrum antiviral agent, inhibits viral envelope fusion (Teissier
et al., 2011) and clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Blaising et al., 2013),
and has been shown to suppress SARS-CoV replication in vitro
(Khamitov et al., 2008). Clinical data indicate that patients treated
with Arbidol experienced a shorter duration of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared
to those treated with lopinavir/ritonavir (Zhu et al., 2020).
