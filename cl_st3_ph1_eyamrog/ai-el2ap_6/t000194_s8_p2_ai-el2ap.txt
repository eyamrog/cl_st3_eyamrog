Aquatic anamorphic fungi, which represent a phylogenetically diverse group (Belliveau
& Barlocher 2005; Duarte et al. 2015), are classified into
four categories based on their tolerance to submergence and their
specific requirements for water during conidiogenesis: aeroaquatic hyphomycetes, terrestrial aquatic
hyphomycetes, submerged aquatic hyphomycetes, and ingoldian hyphomycetes (Goh & Hyde
1996).
