Similarly, Dutra et al.22 investigated the occurrence of leptospirosis in
Minas Gerais State, Brazil, from 1998 to 2012, and observed
an increasing trend in disease rates during the rainy months.
In contrast, Pereira et al.19, who analyzed the trend and
seasonality of leptospirosis in Brazil from 2008 to 2012, did
not detect overall growth in disease incidence during the study
period; however, their seasonally adjusted time series analysis indicated a
strong temporal relationship and the presence of a seasonal component,
with increased surveillance and case detection during rainy periods. Additionally,
Buzzar23, in an analysis of the epidemiological profile of leptospirosis
in SÃ£o Paulo from 2007 to 2011, reported that the
disease was present in all 28 epidemiological surveillance groups throughout
the year, with clear evidence of seasonality, consistent with the
findings of the present study.
