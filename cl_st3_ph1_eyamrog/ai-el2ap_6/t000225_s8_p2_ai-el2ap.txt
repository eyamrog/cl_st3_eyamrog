The primary challenge in evaluating the effectiveness of the SDS
implemented in SÃ£o Paulo is the limited number of tests
conducted in the state, with only 91,552 PCR test kits
supplied by the Brazilian Ministry of Health as of May
1, 2020. Instituto Butantan, which is responsible for coordinating testing
in the state, reported that 35,600 PCR tests had been
performed as of April 22. Given the state's population of
42 million, this corresponds to 85 tests per 100,000 inhabitants.
At the national level, Brazil ranks 133rd among countries in
terms of COVID-19 testing rates. Furthermore, there was a delay
of several weeks between sample collection and the availability of
results during the initial phase of the epidemic. Additionally, Brazilian
authorities report the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths based
on the date test results are obtained, rather than the
date of symptom onset or the date of death.
