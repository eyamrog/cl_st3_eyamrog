Some uncertainty exists due to the novelty of the disease
and the limited availability of biochemical tests, which may result
in misattribution of the cause of death to factors other
than COVID-19 in certain cases. In accordance with the guidelines
established by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, we included in
our analysis both deaths directly attributed to COVID-19 (suspected and
confirmed cases) and the excess deaths attributed to Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) as reported by ARPEN in 2020 compared
to 2019, using the difference between the number of deaths
in 2020 and those in 2019 as the baseline.
