Effective monitoring strategies are essential, and family health agents could
support government efforts by utilizing telemedicine-like approaches based on data
provided by relevant authorities. To enhance transparency in the allocation
of public resources, it is necessary to conduct research on
conditions across different regions of Brazil and to employ geographic
intelligence tools that enable spatial monitoring, integrated with active surveillance
mechanisms, within a framework of participatory oversight of public funds.
Information collection platforms should be used to assess whether the
distribution of benefits to families is effective and whether children
are receiving the food stipulated by law and the National
School Feeding Program (PNAE); to determine the types of food
consumed by children and adolescents and the number of daily
meals, with the assistance of family health agents; and to
provide the government with the information required to develop strategies
for monitoring and supporting the dietary needs of children and
adolescents during the pandemic.
