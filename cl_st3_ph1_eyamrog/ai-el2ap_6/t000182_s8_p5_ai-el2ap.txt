In this study, using an ethological approach, we aim to
characterize the genus Belminus taxonomically by identifying and observing behavioral
patterns elicited by sensory cues from the cockroach host. Belminus
species are synanthropic and play a role in the maintenance
of the Trypanosoma cruzi life cycle, underscoring their eco-epidemiological significance.
However, there are phylogenetic concerns regarding the classification of Belminus
within Triatominae, as they are not obligate hematophages. Although Belminus
species are capable of blood-feeding, they can complete their life
cycle exclusively on arthropod hemolymph, which is their primary food
source in human dwellings. This indicates that hematophagy is not
a definitive autapomorphy within Triatominae, challenging the monophyly of the
subfamily. The feeding behavior observed in Belminus may represent a
primitive trait within Reduviidae, suggesting a closer phylogenetic relationship to
ancestral reduviids, such as assassin bugs, and a more distant
relationship to strictly blood-feeding triatomines. Nevertheless, this evidence, when considered
alongside previous findings, remains inconclusive, as noted by Schaefer (2005),
who argued that the available data are too contradictory to
support definitive conclusions. In this work, rather than focusing on
the type of meal (blood or hemolymph), we examined the
natural history of feeding behavior in order to identify a
behavioral pattern that could serve as an autapomorphy shared by
Belminus and all triatomine species.
