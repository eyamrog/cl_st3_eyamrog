According to the Brazilian government, patients with multiple sclerosis (MS)
or neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) are classified as a
special population at higher risk for severe infection. However, there
is currently no conclusive evidence indicating that MS or NMOSD
patients who contract SARS-CoV-2 are at increased risk of developing
life-threatening COVID-19. To address this knowledge gap, the Brazilian Academy
of Neurology is establishing a national database to monitor MS
patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and assess associated risks within Brazil.
In an Italian case series involving 232 MS patients with
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 96% experienced mild disease, and five patients
(2%) died. Of those who died, four had significant comorbidities
such as hypertension, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, or cardiac disease, and
the mean age among these patients was 66.8 years (range:
54â€“82 years).
