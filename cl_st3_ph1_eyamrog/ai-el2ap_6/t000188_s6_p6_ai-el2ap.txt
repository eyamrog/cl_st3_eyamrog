Social isolation measures and mask usage, which were adopted in
several countries and recommended by local governments in Brazil, were
frequently undermined by the central government, whose statements and actions
minimized their significance as preventive strategies. In Amazonas, the state
with the highest COVID-19 mortality rate, no city achieved the
minimum recommended adherence rate of 70% for social isolation. Furthermore,
many Brazilian cities have exhibited some of the lowest social
isolation rates globally, contributing to one of the highest transmission
rates of SARS-CoV-2 in the world.
