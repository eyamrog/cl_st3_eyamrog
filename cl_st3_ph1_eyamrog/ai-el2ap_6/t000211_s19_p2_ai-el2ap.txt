In response to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic,
the University of Michigan Health System conducted a comprehensive study
on the establishment of a temporary committee composed of specialists
in venous thromboembolism (VTE), vascular surgery, and clinical care to
review and update existing management protocols. This committee engaged in
consultations with additional experts in pulmonology, hematology, and internal medicine,
among other fields, to develop and implement an updated action
plan aimed at optimizing patient care during the pandemic. For
decisions regarding VTE prophylaxis, patients were assessed using the Caprini
score at the time of hospital admission. Although current data
are insufficient to precisely determine the incidence of VTE among
patients with COVID-19, evidence indicates a reduction in mortality among
patients with significantly elevated D-dimer levels (greater than three times
the upper normal limit) who received thromboprophylaxis with either unfractionated
heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Furthermore, VTE
and primary pulmonary thrombus are recognized as potential underlying causes
of mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Based on
these findings and the observation that less critically ill patients
have a low risk of bleeding when receiving thromboprophylaxis, the
study committee recommends routine thromboprophylaxis for all patients hospitalized with
COVID-19, irrespective of risk stratification.
