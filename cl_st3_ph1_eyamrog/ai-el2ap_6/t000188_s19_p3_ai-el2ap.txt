For the Boltzmann data analysis, each region demonstrated a strong
fit, with all R² values approaching 0.999 for the period
from March 17 to May 15, 2020 (Table 1). The
projected total numbers of COVID-19 deaths in Brazil for the
60 days following May 15 were estimated, and the results
are presented in Table 1. The estimated cumulative number of
COVID-19 deaths per 1,000,000 inhabitants by June 15, 2020, is
highest in Roraima (881.98), Rio de Janeiro (761.45), Amazonas (665.56),
Pará (559.62), and Pernambuco (316.87), and lowest in Mato Grosso
do Sul (6.32), Minas Gerais (12.07), Paraná (12.18), Rio Grande
do Sul (18.24), and Santa Catarina (19.86).
