Another non-pharmacological intervention is music therapy, which has been shown
to play a significant role in the regulation of emotions
and the facilitation of human well-being, leading to an increased
stress threshold and improved immune function, thereby contributing to enhanced
quality of life and reduced anxiety (56, 69, 70). Evidence
also indicates that music can produce analgesic effects and suppress
abnormal neural activity in the brain (71).
