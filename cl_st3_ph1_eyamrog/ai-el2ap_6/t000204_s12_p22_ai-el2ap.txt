In support of the argument for implementing measures to address
population mental health during the pandemic, Gao et al. (2020)
reported findings from a survey conducted in China, which indicated
a high prevalence of mental health problems, including depression and
anxiety, associated with extensive exposure to social media during the
COVID-19 outbreak. The authors emphasized the necessity of countering the
dissemination of misinformation and underscored the importance of providing accurate
information. Furthermore, they demonstrated that the provision of mental health
services through various channels is essential for mitigating the psychological
impact of the pandemic.
