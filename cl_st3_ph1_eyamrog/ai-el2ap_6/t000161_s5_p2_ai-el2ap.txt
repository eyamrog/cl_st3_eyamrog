In addition to ongoing debates regarding whether the Journal Impact
Factor (JIF) accurately reflects journal “quality,” the JIF, alongside other
bibliometric indices, is intended to facilitate the identification of patterns
and trends in scholarly publishing. Since its introduction in the
early 1970s—although Garfield (1972) noted its conceptual design dates back
to 1955 (see also Garfield 2006)—the JIF has gained widespread
popularity and has been adopted as a primary metric for
assessing research quality, a practice that remains contentious (Hecht et
al. 1998; Alberts 2013). The JIF is calculated as the
ratio of the number of citations received in a given
year (numerator) to the number of articles published in the
preceding two years (denominator); for example, the 2019 JIF is
determined by dividing the number of citations in 2019 to
articles published in 2017 and 2018 by the total number
of articles published in those two years (Garfield 2006). This
metric provides an indication of the extent to which articles
or topics published by a journal are cited and, by
extension, their reach within the academic community. Problems have arisen
when institutions, including governmental funding agencies, have extended the use
of the JIF beyond journal evaluation to assess the scientific
output of universities, research institutes, graduate programs, and individual researchers.
This extrapolation is logically flawed, as the JIF was not
designed for such purposes. Consequently, the JIF is widely recognized
as the most frequently misapplied and misinterpreted bibliometric index in
academic science (Hecht et al. 1998; Haustein & Larivière 2015;
Ioannidis & Thombs 2019).
