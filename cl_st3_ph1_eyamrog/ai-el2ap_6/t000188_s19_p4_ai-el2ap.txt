On July 15, the total number of deaths predicted in
the country is 56,955. However, according to model A2, the
total number of deaths may reach 64,262. This estimate may
vary depending on the standard deviation reported for each state
(Table 1). The projected number of cumulative cases per 1,000,000
inhabitants is highest in Rio de Janeiro, Roraima, Amazonas, Pará,
and Pernambuco, with values of 1,586.02, 1,054.57, 697.91, 586.77, and
353.16, respectively. In São Paulo, the estimated rate is 152.12
COVID-19 deaths per 1,000,000 inhabitants. Lower death rates per 1,000,000
inhabitants are projected for Mato Grosso do Sul (6.68), Paraná
(12.32), Minas Gerais (13.79), Rio Grande do Sul (18.90), and
Santa Catarina (30.24). The spatial distribution of cumulative COVID-19 death
rates across all states is illustrated in Figure 2 for
June 15 and Figure 3 for July 15, with color
gradients indicating the relative intensity of these rates.
