In summary, the cellular mechanisms involved in coronavirus replication constitute
a complex and integrated network of molecular events, beginning with
the translation of nonstructural proteins (Nsps), proteolytic cleavage of polyproteins,
assembly of the replication-transcription complex (RTC), and proceeding through the
transcription of antigenomic, genomic, and subgenomic RNAs, translation of structural
proteins, and ultimately the assembly and budding of viral particles.
Analysis of cellular proteins interacting with coronavirus proteins indicates modulation
of key cellular pathways, including those related to innate immunity,
cell cycle regulation, and protein synthesis. Current therapeutic approaches for
COVID-19 are partially targeted at these molecular events and pathways;
however, future pharmacological interventions may benefit from a more comprehensive
understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle.
