Three distinct arenas were utilized to investigate the behavior of
Belminus species. Bioassays were conducted at a temperature of 24
°C and a relative humidity of 68%, under illumination from
fluorescent ceiling lights with a brightness of 2000 lux and
a color temperature of 4000 K, unless otherwise indicated. All
experiments were carried out in Mérida, Venezuela, at altitudes ranging
from 1700 to 1860 meters above sea level.
