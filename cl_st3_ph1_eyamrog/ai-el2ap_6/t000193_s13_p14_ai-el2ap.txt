Currently, there are no specific guidelines for the treatment of
pregnant women, children, or older patients (over 60 years of
age) with multiple sclerosis (MS) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given
that geriatric and pregnant patients are at increased risk of
severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, and recent meta-analytic evidence indicates that older
patients may exhibit suboptimal responses to MS therapies, it is
recommended that disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) be prescribed to pregnant and
geriatric patients based on individual risk assessment.
