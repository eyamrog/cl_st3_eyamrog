To further investigate the cellular proteins associated with coronavirus biology,
we conducted Ingenuity Pathway Analysis using the protein list provided
in Table 2. This analysis generated a list of canonical
pathways, shown in Table 3, that are potentially relevant or
modulated during the coronavirus replication cycle. The top ten pathways
were selected based on their associated p-values. Notably, the analysis
indicated modulation of key molecular pathways, including p53 and mTOR,
as well as inhibition of the host immune response through
suppression of interferon induction and alterations in cell cycle and
cell growth. These findings suggest that such molecular events may
promote a cellular environment conducive to viral replication and suppression
of apoptosis, thereby facilitating progression of the viral life cycle.
