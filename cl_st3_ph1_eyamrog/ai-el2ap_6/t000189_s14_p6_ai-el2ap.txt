Studies such as reviews, letters to the editor, theses, and
dissertations that addressed bacterial infections, including tuberculosis, utilized experimental models,
or employed analytical methodologies focused on assessing the association between
infection and subsequent nutritional deficiency were excluded from the present
review. To enhance the sensitivity of the search for studies
related to iron deficiency, the term "anemia" was included as
a descriptor; however, studies that identified anemia solely through hematocrit
and hemoglobin measurements, without evaluating iron status using ferritin and
transferrin receptor levels [14,15], were not considered eligible for inclusion.
