When the progression of an event follows an exponential pattern,
associated uncertainties also increase exponentially, as observed during the COVID-19
pandemic. Various mathematical models, developed using available knowledge and data,
are capable of simulating different scenarios and identifying trends. Despite
the inherent uncertainties present in any scientific analysis, findings derived
from mathematical models are considered highly significant for informing public
policy decisions. A relatively simple model in terms of interpretation
and application, which has previously been utilized in studies conducted
in China, is the Boltzmann model. Therefore, the objective of
this study was to estimate the total potential number of
COVID-19-related deaths in Brazil over the subsequent two months using
the Boltzmann function, based on regression analysis.
