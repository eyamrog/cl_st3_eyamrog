Cities without any reported cases of COVID-19 by the date
of analysis were less populous and had lower rates of
both rapid and molecular testing compared to cities with reported
cases (Table 1). There was a marked predominance of disease
notifications in the Central, Northern Triangle, and Southeast health macro-regions.
Conversely, the Northeast, Jequitinhonha, and East macro-regions accounted for more
than 40% of the 215 cities that had no recorded
cases of the disease by the date of analysis.
