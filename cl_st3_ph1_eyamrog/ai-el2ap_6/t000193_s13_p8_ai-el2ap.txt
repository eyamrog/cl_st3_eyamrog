Certain acute demyelinating events do not meet the diagnostic criteria
for multiple sclerosis (MS) or neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD).
These events include acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), idiopathic isolated optic
neuritis (ON), and idiopathic isolated transverse myelitis (TM). Management of
these conditions should involve intravenous corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and plasma
exchange, consistent with standard practice outside of pandemic circumstances. Long-term
immunotherapy is generally not indicated for these conditions.
