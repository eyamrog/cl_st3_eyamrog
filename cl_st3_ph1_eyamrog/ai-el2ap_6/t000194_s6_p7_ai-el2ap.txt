Six taxa exhibited a frequency index ranging from 26.6% to
40%, namely Anguillospora longissima, Flagellospora curvula, Lunulospora cymbiformis, Scutisporus brunneus,
Tripospermum myrti, and Triscelophorus acuminatus, and were therefore classified as
accessory species. These taxa have also been frequently documented in
multiple studies conducted in Brazil (Schoenlein-Crusius et al. 2009; Fiuza
& Gusmão 2011; Fiuza & Gusmão 2013; Fiuza et al.
2015; Schoenlein-Crusius et al. 2015).
