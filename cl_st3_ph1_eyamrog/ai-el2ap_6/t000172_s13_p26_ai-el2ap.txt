SARS-CoV has been reported to induce cell cycle arrest. The
nucleocapsid protein arrests the cell cycle at the S phase
by directly interacting with cyclin D and inhibiting the CDK4/cyclin
D complex, thereby preventing phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein,
which is a key regulator of cell cycle progression (Surjit
et al., 2006). Additionally, infection with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV)
leads to a reduction in cyclin D1 levels, a protein
involved in the G2/M transition, resulting in cell cycle arrest
at the G2/M phase (Harrison et al., 2007).
