In buildings without mechanical ventilation systems, increased reliance on window-driven
natural ventilation is recommended. The use of operable windows should
be prioritized to enhance air exchange, even if this results
in some degree of thermal discomfort. Additionally, in buildings equipped
with mechanical ventilation, the opening of windows can be employed
as a supplementary measure to further improve ventilation rates.
