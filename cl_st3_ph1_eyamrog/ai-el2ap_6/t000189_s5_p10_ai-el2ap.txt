A case-control study by Mamani et al. (2017) [35], involving
149 adults diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia, found that individuals with
vitamin D deficiency (<10 ng/mL) had a 3.69-fold increased risk
of developing pneumonia compared to those with sufficient vitamin D
levels (>20 ng/mL) (95% CI: 1.46â€“9.31; p<0.01).
