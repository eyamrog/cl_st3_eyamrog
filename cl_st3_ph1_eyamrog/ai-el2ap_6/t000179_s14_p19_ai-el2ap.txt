The fit of the different models for the three scales
was evaluated in three steps. First, a set of goodness-of-fit
indices was estimated, including the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and
the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), with optimal values defined as â‰¥0.95,
as well as the Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR)
and the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) with
a 90% confidence interval, both considered adequate if <0.08 (26,
27). In the second and final step, for scales comprising
two or more dimensions, the correlations between dimensions were assessed
to determine the extent of overlap. A correlation coefficient below
0.80 was considered indicative of clear differentiation between dimensions (23).
