The term ‘aquatic hyphomycetes’ does not have taxonomic significance; rather,
it is used ecologically to describe a group of anamorphic
fungi, or asexual ascomycetes, that have at least part or
all of their life cycle occurring in freshwater environments. This
group also includes fungi that originate exclusively in aquatic habitats
(Chan et al. 2000).
