Several studies have contributed to the understanding of the geographical
distribution of anamorphic fungi in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest (Schoenlein-Crusius
& Milanez 1989, Schoenlein-Crusius & Milanez 1990, Schoenlein-Crusius & Milanez
1998, Grandi 1998, 1999, Gusmão et al. 2001, Grandi &
Gusmão 2002, Silva et al. 2019). However, among these studies,
only Silva et al. (2019) included sampling sites located in
a lentic system on an island.
