Similarly, B. corredori (P=0.001) and B. ferroae (P=0.008) exhibited avoidance
of the Y-olfactometer arm containing volatiles from mouse wastes (Fig.
3). The chi-square test of independence indicated no significant association
between species and behavioral responses (P=0.477). Overall, individuals of the
genus Belminus (n=48) avoided volatiles from mouse wastes in 79%
of trials (P=0.000023).
