Shigemura et al. (2015) reported that patients infected with COVID-19,
or suspected of being infected, may experience significant emotional and
behavioral responses, including fear, boredom, loneliness, anxiety, insomnia, and anger.
These symptoms have also been documented in individuals affected by
previous epidemics (Brooks et al., 2020).
