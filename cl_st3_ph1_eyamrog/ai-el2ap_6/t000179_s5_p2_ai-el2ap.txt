A systematic review found that, between 2000 and 2017, 61
studies evaluating job satisfaction among physicians were conducted in Europe,
utilizing 26 different assessment instruments (38). Additionally, 31% of these
studies developed their own instruments to measure job satisfaction (38).
The substantial heterogeneity in the instruments used across the European
context may be attributable to variations in the organization and
functioning of healthcare systems, suggesting that the application of a
single instrument could result in biased conclusions. In Latin America,
there is no available data identifying the most commonly used
instruments for assessing job satisfaction. Nevertheless, some studies in the
region have adapted various instruments, such as the Copenhagen Psychosocial
Questionnaire (39) and the Warr–Cook–Wall Job Satisfaction Scale (40). These
studies were conducted on small, non-nationally representative samples and employed
instruments originally developed for healthcare contexts in European countries. Although
some instruments have been designed within Latin American countries, they
are subject to similar limitations as those observed in the
European context.
