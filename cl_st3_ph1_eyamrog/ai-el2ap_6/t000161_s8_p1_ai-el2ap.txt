Each year, major scientific data analytics companies, including the American-British
Clarivate™ (InCites™) and the Dutch RELX™ Elsevier B.V. (Scopus®), release
updated metrics for scientific journals indexed in their extensive databases,
such as the Journal Impact Factor™ (JIF) and CiteScore™, respectively.
These metrics are widely adopted by various countries as primary
indicators of research quality within universities and research institutes. Research
funding in these institutions is typically sourced from public taxation.
The reliance on these metrics has led to a strong
emphasis on publishing in higher-ranked journals (Ioannidis & Thombs, 2019).
Consequently, researchers with publications in journals with higher impact factors
are more likely to advance in their careers, gain recognition,
and secure research grants. As a result, these metrics exert
significant influence on the direction and nature of contemporary scientific
research.
