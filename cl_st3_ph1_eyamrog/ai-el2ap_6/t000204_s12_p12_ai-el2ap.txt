Another important consideration, based on observations from previous events, is
that during pandemics, the number of individuals experiencing adverse mental
health effects often exceeds the number of those directly affected
by the infection. Evidence from past crises indicates that the
mental health consequences can persist for a longer duration and
exhibit a higher prevalence than the infectious disease itself, with
significant psychosocial and economic impacts.
