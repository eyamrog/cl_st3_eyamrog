We held meetings with colleagues from the Network and with
legal professionals, during which we recognized that we were all
engaged in addressing issues related to abortion, often without explicit
awareness of this shared involvement. Throughout this period, we attempted
to contribute from our respective roles within medical consultations; however,
we lacked both organization and an understanding of the specific
needs of those we were assisting. This situation has changed,
as the counselling sessions have now provided a structured framework
for the practices we had previously undertaken individually. (P., male,
