This perspective, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and
its aftermath, addresses the challenges faced by educators and learners
regarding mental health. Evidence suggests that the engagement of brain
regions involved in emotional processing, such as the limbic system,
combined with the potential for viral transmission between neurons, may
disrupt the release of key neurotransmitters, including glutamate and acetylcholine
(excitatory), GABA and dopamine (inhibitory), as well as serotonin (which
has both excitatory and inhibitory functions), and may also affect
glial cells that respond to environmental stimuli. Consequently, it is
hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 can impair the efficiency of neural circuits,
thereby affecting both afferent and efferent projections that are essential
for learning processes (73).
