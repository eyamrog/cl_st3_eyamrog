For each region, in addition to reporting leptospirosis rates, the
strength of the associations between month of occurrence and leptospirosis
rate is presented using the correlation coefficient (r) and the
coefficient of determination (R²), which indicates the proportion of variation
in disease occurrence explained by the independent variable. To interpret
temporal trends, both the beta coefficient (b) and the Monthly
Percentage Variation (MPV) were calculated; the MPV is derived by
applying a logarithmic transformation to the Y values in the
time series, which helps to reduce heteroscedasticity in the regression
residuals, and is calculated using the formula: MPV = [-1
+ 10^b1] × 100%. The direction of the trends (increase,
decrease, or stability) and their corresponding p-values are also reported.
