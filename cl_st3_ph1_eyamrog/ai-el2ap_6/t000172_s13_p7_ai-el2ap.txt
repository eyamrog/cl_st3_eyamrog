Once the complete genomic RNA and the mRNAs corresponding to
each structural open reading frame (ORF) are synthesized, translation of
these genes is initiated (Figure 2, process 3), resulting in
the production of the S, E, M, and N proteins,
which are essential for viral particle assembly, as well as
additional proteins encoded by ORFs 3a, 6, 7a/b, 8, and
9. The specific functions of these proteins will be discussed
in subsequent sections. The viral replication cycle proceeds with the
interaction of the N protein and the viral genomic RNA,
leading to the formation of the nucleocapsid in the cytosol
(Figure 2, process 4). In contrast, the S, E, and
M proteins are targeted to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER)
(Fehr and Perlman 2015). Subsequent interactions among these structural proteins
facilitate the recruitment of nucleocapsids into the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate
compartment (ERGIC), located between the RER and the Golgi apparatus,
ultimately resulting in the exocytosis of mature viral particles (Figure
2, processes 5 and 6) (Fehr and Perlman 2015). A
notable characteristic of coronavirus replication is the high frequency of
mutation and recombination events, which can alter viral protein properties,
host range, and pathogenicity. For instance, heterologous recombination between subgroup
A Betacoronaviruses and other viruses has been documented, as evidenced
by the presence of the hemagglutinin esterase gene in some
coronaviruses, which is derived from influenza C virus (Zeng et
al. 2008). Recombination events between coronaviruses infecting different species are
also widely reported and may account for the observed genomic
similarities between human SARS-CoV-2 and coronaviruses from bats and pangolins
(Lu et al. 2020; Lau et al. 2020). Three factors
may contribute to this increased capacity for recombination and mutation:
