During the COVID-19 outbreak, schools in China were closed, and
students were required to remain at home. Primary and secondary
schools established official online educational platforms to enable students to
continue their education (47). Consequently, most parents assumed increased educational
responsibilities in addition to managing their children's emotional and behavioral
issues continuously throughout the week.
