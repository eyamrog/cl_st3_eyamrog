Coronavirus nonstructural protein 6 (nsp6) has been shown to interfere
with autophagy by restricting the diameter of autophagosomes during omegasome
formation, which may facilitate viral infection by impairing the autophagic
degradation of viral components via lysosomes (Cottam et al., 2014).
Additionally, the coronavirus endoribonuclease nsp15 is necessary for evasion of
double-stranded RNA sensors and inhibition of apoptosis, as loss of
nsp15 activity is associated with disease attenuation in mice and
the induction of a protective immune response (Deng et al.,
2017). Furthermore, nsp16 has been reported to downregulate the activities
of RIG-I and MDA5, thereby inhibiting innate immune responses and
promoting viral replication (Shi et al., 2019).
