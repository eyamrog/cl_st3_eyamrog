Several studies have demonstrated that coronavirus proteins modulate cellular pathways,
thereby facilitating the viral life cycle or influencing viral pathogenesis,
as summarized in Table 2. For example, interactions have been
identified between the coronavirus nsp1 protein and the cyclophilins PPIA,
PPIG, PPIH, as well as FKBP1A and FKBP1B, which are
known to regulate the Calcineurin/NFAT pathway, a key mediator in
immune cell activation (Pfefferle et al., 2011). In this study,
the yeast two-hybrid system was employed to confirm these interactions,
and it was further shown that inhibition of cyclophilins by
cyclosporine A (CspA) suppressed the replication of various coronaviruses, including
human SARS-CoV, CoV-229E, CoV-NL63, feline CoV, and avian infectious bronchitis
virus (IBV). Additionally, another study reported an interaction between SARS-CoV
nsp2 and cellular prohibitins, indicating that this nonstructural protein may
contribute to the disruption of intracellular host signaling pathways (Cornillez-Ty
et al., 2009).
