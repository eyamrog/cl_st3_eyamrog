Previous research on hurricanes, floods, and other infectious disease epidemics
has identified a range of adverse psychological reactions in affected
populations, including anxiety, acute stress, addictive behaviors, symptoms of post-traumatic
stress disorder, and increased rates of suicide and depression during
and after such events (20). Based on these findings, it
is anticipated that similar psychological effects will occur in the
context of the current COVID-19 pandemic.
