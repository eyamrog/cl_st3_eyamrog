Although there was considerable variation in pH values among the
sampling sites (ranging from 3.84 to 8.75), these values were
consistent with those reported in previous studies, such as Nascimento
(2007), who observed pH values between 5.8 and 6.6, and
Schoenlein-Crusius et al. (2009), who reported a range from 3.36
to 9.08.
