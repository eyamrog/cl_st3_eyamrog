Using a time series analysis referenced to the date of
death rather than the date of COVID-19 testing, this study
demonstrates that the Social Distancing Strategy implemented in São Paulo
State was associated with a substantial reduction in the number
of infections. The effect was particularly pronounced in São Paulo
City, where the rate of COVID-19 transmission decreased significantly, especially
during the period from April 5 to April 20.
