The model demonstrated a high degree of fit, with R²
values approaching 0.999. As of May 15, a total of
14,817 COVID-19 deaths had been confirmed in the country. Amazonas
reported the highest cumulative case rate per 1,000,000 inhabitants (321.14),
followed by Ceará (161.63). Projections indicate that Rio de Janeiro,
Roraima, Amazonas, Pará, and Pernambuco are expected to experience a
substantial increase in cumulative case rates by July 15. In
contrast, Mato Grosso do Sul, Paraná, Minas Gerais, Rio Grande
do Sul, and Santa Catarina are projected to maintain lower
