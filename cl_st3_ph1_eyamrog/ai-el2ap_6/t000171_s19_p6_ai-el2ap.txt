Despite these findings, the temporal correlation was more pronounced (Figure
3). At the municipal level in the state of Minas
Gerais, the analysis of the association between the elapsed time
since the first notified case and the number of rapid
tests yielded a correlation coefficient of -0.11. The correlation coefficient
between the elapsed time and the number of RT-PCR tests
was -0.22. For the association between the elapsed time and
the incidence rate, the coefficient was -0.25, and for the
association with the mortality rate, the coefficient was -0.19.
