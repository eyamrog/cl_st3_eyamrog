The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant and enduring challenges
for individuals, communities, and institutions. Students have experienced disruptions to
their education and career trajectories, professional colleagues face obstacles in
reestablishing their practices, and staff at dental schools are encountering
a range of difficulties. Nevertheless, the collective response to these
challenges has provided valuable learning opportunities. The practice of dentistry
and the delivery of dental education have undergone substantial changes
due to the pandemic, highlighting the importance of sharing experiences
and adopting best practices. This situation presents an opportunity to
critically evaluate clinical protocols, enhance biosafety measures, and explore innovative
approaches to dental education for future practitioners. Furthermore, it is
essential that dental education programs integrate considerations for future pandemics
into their accreditation standards.
