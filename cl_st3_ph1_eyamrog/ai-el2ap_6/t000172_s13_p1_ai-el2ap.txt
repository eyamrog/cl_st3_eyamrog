The Coronaviridae family, which belongs to the order Nidovirales, is
divided into two subfamilies: Coronavirinae and Torovirinae. The Coronavirinae subfamily
comprises four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. SARS-CoV-2 (also
referred to as 2019-nCoV), the causative agent of COVID-19, is
classified within the Betacoronavirus genus, along with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Comparative genomic analyses have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 shares 88% sequence
identity with two bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21) collected
in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, which is higher than
its identity with SARS-CoV (approximately 79%) and MERS-CoV (approximately 50%)
(Lu et al., 2020). Additionally, the SARS-CoV-2 genome exhibits 91.02%
identity with Pangolin-CoV, while showing an even higher identity of
96.2% with another bat coronavirus, RaTG13 (Zhang et al., 2020c).
Coronaviruses possess a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome (ssRNA+), placing them
in class IV of the Baltimore classification system (Baltimore, 1971).
The genomic organization of coronaviruses consists of two primary regions:
one encoding the non-structural polyproteins pp1a and pp1b, and the
other encoding the structural proteins, including the S (spike), E
(envelope), M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) genes, as illustrated in
Figure 1.
