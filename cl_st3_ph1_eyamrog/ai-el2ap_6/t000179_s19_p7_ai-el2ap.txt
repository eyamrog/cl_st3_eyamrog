Both the one-dimensional and two-dimensional models demonstrated adequate goodness-of-fit indices.
However, the two-dimensional model exhibited a very high latent correlation
(greater than 0.80), indicating substantial overlap between its dimensions (see
Table 3). Therefore, the one-dimensional model with eight items was
identified as the most appropriate model for this scale.
