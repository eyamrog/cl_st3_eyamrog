As illustrated in Figure 1, schools fulfill at least four
distinct roles that underscore their significance in the lives of
children, adolescents, family members, and society at large. Central to
this context, particularly with respect to cognitive development, education encompasses
socialization, which facilitates the development of socio-emotional skills in children
and adolescents; care, by providing a safe environment that enables
parents to participate in the workforce; and nutrition, as schools
often serve as the primary source of meals that meet
the nutritional requirements essential for healthy development. The COVID-19 pandemic
has introduced additional complexity to achieving the objectives associated with
each of these roles, presenting significant challenges for educators, governments,
schools, and families.
