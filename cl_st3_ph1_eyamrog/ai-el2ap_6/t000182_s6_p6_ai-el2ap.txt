The feeding fixed action pattern (FAP) observed in this study
is derived from an ancestral hemipteran behavior. Hatfield et al.
(1983) reported similar sequential feeding behaviors in the phytophagous bug
Lygus lineolaris (Hemiptera: Miridae). Haridass et al. (1987) categorized reduviids
based on their approach behaviors during feeding into six types:
(i) blood feeding, (ii) sticky-trap, (iii) raptorial, (iv) wait and
grab, (v) pin and jab, and (vi) chase and pounce.
Reduviid predators typically employ “assessing” and “ambush” strategies (Edwards 1962;
Ables 1978), which differ from the FAP observed in Belminus,
particularly in prey handling. Members of the Harpactocorinae, for example,
often remain stationary and wait for prey to arrive on
a flower before striking (Haridass et al. 1988; Ambrose 1999).
Edwards (1962) described the feeding FAP for Rhinocoris carmelita (Harpactocorinae)
and Platymeris rhadamanthus (Reduviinae) as consisting of arousal, orientation, fixation,
approach, facultative pounce, rostrum extension, grasping, apprehension, stylet insertion, and
saliva injection. Srikumar et al. (2014) outlined the feeding FAP
for harpactorine reduviids as arousal, approach, capture, rostral thrust, paralysis,
sucking, and post-predatory behaviors. Similar behavioral sequences have been reported
by other authors (Ables 1978; Haridass and Ananthakrishnan 1980). Ables
(1978) noted that smaller, more mobile prey are typically ambushed,
while larger, less mobile prey are stalked, and that upon
prey detection, the predator becomes motionless with raised fore tibiae
and extended antennae; initial contact usually involves antennation followed by
proboscis insertion. Srikumar et al. (2014) further reported that after
prey are pinned and jabbed, reduviids paralyze them by injecting
toxic saliva. Some reduviid species transport prey to secluded locations
beneath leaves or twigs before feeding, and may restrain prey
with their fore and mid-legs until the prey is subdued
(Edwards 1962; Srikumar et al. 2014).
