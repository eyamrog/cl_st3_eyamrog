The data presented above indicate that SDS can alter the
progression of disease spread. Furthermore, the findings highlight the importance
of recording events according to their actual dates of occurrence.
This approach is particularly relevant in the context of how
Brazilian authorities have managed and projected disease data. Analyzing events
based on their occurrence dates is essential for accurately characterizing
the temporal dynamics of disease transmission, as it provides a
more reliable understanding of the spread of the disease compared
to analyses based on the timing of testing or public
announcements.
