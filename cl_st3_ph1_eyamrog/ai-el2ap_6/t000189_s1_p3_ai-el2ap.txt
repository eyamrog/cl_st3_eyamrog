RESULTS: Six articles met the inclusion criteria, all of which
addressed deficiencies in vitamins A and D. Overall, vitamin A
deficiency was associated with increased incidence of cough, fever, and
elevated total respiratory resistance. In relation to vitamin D, deficiency
was linked to higher rates of intensive care unit admission,
increased need for mechanical ventilation, and greater mortality. However, evidence
establishing specific relationships between nutritional deficiencies and COVID-19 remains limited
due to the small number of studies and heterogeneity among
population subgroups.
