Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive agent that is occasionally used in
the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). At low
doses (e.g., 7.5 to 25 mg), the risk of myelosuppression
is low, and most patients do not develop opportunistic infections
unless they are also receiving high-dose corticosteroids. However, hepatotoxicity is
a common adverse effect. Pancytopenia may occur at various points
during therapy, but most cases are associated with predisposing factors,
most commonly impaired renal function. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it
is recommended that patients receiving stable doses of methotrexate without
adverse events in the preceding six months undergo complete blood
count (CBC) and liver enzyme monitoring every six months. For
patients who have been on methotrexate for less than six
months or who have a history of adverse events, more
frequent monitoring, such as every two to three months, is
advised. Table 3 provides a summary of considerations for the
use of disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) in NMOSD during the COVID-19
pandemic.
