In agreement with several members of the scientific community, we
recognize that open data is essential for enhancing the quality
of science by promoting transparency, reproducibility, efficiency, and societal benefits
(Molloy, 2013). Public databases are fundamental to advancing open science
and ensuring reproducibility; therefore, the availability of sequencing data on
these platforms is critical for scientific research and should be
both practiced and encouraged. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of
establishing a national genome sequencing plan, coordinated by public and
private research institutions, to increase the representation of Peruvian genetic
information in public databases, facilitate collaboration among institutions, and provide
resources to address issues in areas such as agriculture, public
health, and biodiversity conservation. Additionally, we recommend the implementation of
a nationwide capacity-building initiative to train a new generation of
Peruvian bioinformaticians, who will be essential for addressing future challenges
related to biodiversity.
