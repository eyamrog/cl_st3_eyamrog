Overall, there is limited data on this topic in the
Latin American region, and many existing scales developed in other
contexts require further analysis and validation. The three scales presented
in this study were specifically developed to account for the
characteristics of a middle-income country in Latin America, such as
Peru, and demonstrated adequate evidence of validity and reliability. For
instance, the scales consider factors such as the intermittent availability
of basic services like water, drainage, and electricity in primary
care centers (item c2p81_11), the common practice of health professionals
working simultaneously in multiple institutions (item c2p82_3), and the organization
of work schedules, including rotations and changes in opening hours
(item c2p83_5). Consequently, these scales may serve as useful tools
for assessing various aspects of job satisfaction among physicians in
Peru and other Spanish-speaking countries with comparable healthcare settings.
