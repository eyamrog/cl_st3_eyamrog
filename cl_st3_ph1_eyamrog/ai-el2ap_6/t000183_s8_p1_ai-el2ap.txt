English has become a significant language for communication in the
scientific, technological, political, and economic domains. Additionally, its global dissemination
has been facilitated through various forms of entertainment. Previous estimates
have indicated that the number of learners of English as
a foreign language is expected to continue increasing, particularly in
countries such as China and India (Graddol, 2006, p. 168).
