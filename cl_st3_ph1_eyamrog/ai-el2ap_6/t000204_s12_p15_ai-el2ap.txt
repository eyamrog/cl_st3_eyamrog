It is estimated that 50 to 60% of the North
American population may be exposed to at least one traumatic
event during their lifetime (25). While the majority of individuals
recover from such experiences, approximately 10 to 30% develop post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD). Although pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments are often
effective for PTSD, 20 to 30% of patients do not
respond to conventional therapies (26).
