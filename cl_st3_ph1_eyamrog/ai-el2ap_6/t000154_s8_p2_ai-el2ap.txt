While peer review is generally regarded as reliable and beneficial
(Jubb, 2016; Mulligan et al., 2013), there is limited direct
evidence supporting its effectiveness (Jefferson et al., 2007; Smith, 2006;
2010), and traditional peer review has been subject to substantial
criticism and calls for reform over time (Csiszar, 2016; Ross-Hellauer,
2017; Tennant et al., 2017). For example, Richard Smith, a
former medical editor, has characterized traditional peer review as inconsistent,
biased, susceptible to abuse, inefficient, resistant to innovative research, and
ineffective at detecting errors (Smith, 2006; 2010). His former journal
was among the first to implement reforms to the peer
review process (Schroter et al., 2020), and subsequent developments have
contributed to what has been described as a significant transformation
in peer review practices (Tennant et al., 2017).
