The role of healthcare workers (HCWs) in facilitating the transmission
of pathogens between patients is well established. However, recent evidence
indicates that environmental contamination also plays a significant role in
the transmission of pathogens. Several factors, such as temperature, humidity,
and disease severity, may influence the concentration of viral particles
present in aerosol samples [38].
