Participants initially completed a socio-demographic survey that included items assessing
the prevalence of chronic diseases and levels of social isolation
experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Subsequently, psychological distress was measured
using the Peri-Traumatic Distress Index (CPDI), a validated self-report instrument
that evaluates symptoms of depression, anxiety, avoidance, compulsive behavior, specific
phobias, cognitive changes, physical symptoms, and loss of social functioning
(Qiu et al., 2020).
