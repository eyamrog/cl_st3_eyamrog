Datacenter facilities are increasingly adopting adiabatic cooling systems to achieve
energy savings, as measured by indices such as Energy Usage
Effectiveness Design (EUED) and Total Water Impact (TWI). The maintenance
of moderately higher humidity levels (45%–65%) in these environments supports
the effective operation of adiabatic systems and permits higher chilled
water inlet temperatures for air conditioning units. This approach improves
compressor efficiency and contributes to overall reductions in energy consumption
[40–41].
