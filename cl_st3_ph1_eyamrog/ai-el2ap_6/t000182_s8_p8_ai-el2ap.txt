In summary, this study aimed to: a) describe the fixed
action pattern (FAP) associated with feeding in Belminus; b) determine
whether host volatiles alone are sufficient to elicit the FAP
or induce chemotaxis in Belminus; and c) evaluate the potential
of this FAP as a distinguishing characteristic that separates Belminus
and all triatomines from other reduviid species.
