The results of the CPDI and FCV-19S indicate gender differences
in responses to the pandemic. It is essential that women
are adequately represented in policy-making processes, as socially constructed gender
roles position them to contribute effectively to the development of
multi-level interventions addressing both the primary and secondary effects of
COVID-19, as well as to the formulation of equitable policies
and innovative strategies for pandemic control.
