During the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to the imperative of
preserving life, a significant challenge has been the reorganization of
behavior, particularly the adaptation of habits within educational contexts to
align with a scientific perspective and to leverage the consequences
of the pandemic as opportunities for improvement. Neuroscience identifies neuroplasticity
as a fundamental property, which may equip educators and students
to address the challenges and conflicts arising during and after
the pandemic. Furthermore, the adverse conditions experienced highlight the necessity
for developing autonomy in learning, as the teaching-learning process is
inherently dialectical. For instance, difficulties such as memory loss may
be misattributed to deficits in attention, and vice versa, underscoring
the complexity of cognitive processes in educational settings.
