Participants were recruited through four distinct advertisements. The Brazilian Society
of Family and Community Medicine (SBMFC) sent email invitations to
its eligible members on April 7 and May 8, 2020.
The Brazilian Journal of Family and Community Medicine (RBMFC) distributed
a survey announcement to its registered users, including readers, authors,
reviewers, and others, on April 12 and May 5, 2020.
Additionally, one of the survey authors forwarded the SBMFC announcement
to the societyâ€™s email discussion list on May 6, 2020.
Throughout the survey period, RBMFC also displayed an announcement in
the rightmost lateral column of its website, positioned above the
fold to ensure visibility on screens larger than those of
smartphones. Consistent with the informed consent page, all advertisements neutrally
described the survey objectives and specified eligibility criteria. Anticipating potential
overlap among stakeholder groups, all advertisements directed participants to a
single landing page. This page did not require a username
or password but was accessible only to individuals who had
the specific URL.
