Essential meetings were limited to a maximum of ten participants,
with adherence to mask usage and maintenance of a minimum
distance of one meter between individuals. Additionally, daily visits were
conducted with a reduced number of personnel, and patients with
suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were attended to exclusively by a
single designated team member.
