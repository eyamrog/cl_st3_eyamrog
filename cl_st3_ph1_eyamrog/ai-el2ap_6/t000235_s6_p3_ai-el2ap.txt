Non-enhanced chest CT is widely regarded as the first-line imaging
modality for the evaluation of COVID-19 pneumonia. Certain ancillary findings
on non-enhanced CT, such as peripheral lung opacities with features
indicative of pulmonary infarction (including the reversed halo sign or
central lucencies), dilatation of the pulmonary trunk, and increased cardiac
volume—particularly enlargement of the right cardiac chamber—may suggest an increased
risk of pulmonary embolism (PE). These findings, as demonstrated in
our patient, can assist in determining the need for CT
pulmonary angiography (CTPA) to confirm or exclude PE. In addition,
clinical parameters such as elevated D-dimer levels, hemoptysis, sudden deterioration
in respiratory function, or chest pain should be taken into
account. Signs of right heart strain on electrocardiogram or echocardiogram
may also contribute to the identification of patients with COVID-19
who are at risk for concurrent PE. However, potential contraindications
to the use of intravenous iodinated contrast media, including a
history of allergy to contrast agents and renal dysfunction, must
be carefully considered when deciding whether to perform CTPA.
