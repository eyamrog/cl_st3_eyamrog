The results indicate that the model employed is suitable for
analyzing and predicting cumulative COVID-19 death cases, as all data
sets demonstrated a good fit to the Boltzmann function. However,
factors such as host characteristics and behavior, pathogen survivability, and
environmental conditions may influence the accuracy of the model's estimates,
given that the model assumes stable general conditions. Furthermore, the
actual number of deaths may be higher than predicted due
to potential underreporting. Nevertheless, a key advantage of this model
is its reliance solely on the cumulative number of confirmed
cases or deaths, providing a rapid method that can support
decision-making regarding interventions to control the COVID-19 pandemic.
