Cladribine is an immunosuppressive agent utilized as induction therapy in
patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). It induces preferential lymphocyte depletion,
reaching its lowest point approximately one month after the final
administered dose, with further reduction observed following the second treatment
cycle. At this stage, a reduction of approximately 60% in
CD4+ lymphocyte counts and 40% in CD8+ lymphocyte counts is
typically observed, followed by relative stabilization within one year. Notably,
the extent of lymphopenia does not appear to correlate with
the occurrence of MS relapses. However, more severe lymphopenia, defined
as fewer than 500 lymphocytes per mmÂ³, was associated with
a two-fold increase in the incidence of Herpes Zoster in
pivotal clinical trials.
