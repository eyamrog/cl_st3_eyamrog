The Network of professionals was established at the end of
2014 as an interdisciplinary space comprising gynecologists, obstetricians, clinical doctors,
nurses, social workers, and psychologists working in the public sector.
The interdisciplinary nature of the Network is a significant strength,
as it frames abortion not as the exclusive domain of
a single specialty but as an issue requiring the involvement
and recognition of multiple health professionals. This diversity of specializations
helps mitigate the risk of increased stigmatization for professionals with
comparatively less symbolic capital, such as psychologists, social workers, and
nurses, who participate in abortion care. Symbolic capital is defined
as “the form that the different types of capital take
when they are perceived and recognized as legitimate” (Costa 2015,
p.2), conferring an advantage to those who possess it. Within
the Network, a substantial proportion of general practitioners are notable
for their specialization in community health, which positions them at
the forefront of primary healthcare delivery. Their responsibilities emphasize preventive
measures and health promotion, consistent with the objectives of the
Primary Healthcare Service Program (APS, by its Spanish acronym). Currently,
a significant number of non-punishable abortions are conducted at the
primary care level, primarily through the ambulatory administration of misoprostol
(Amnesty International 2017).
