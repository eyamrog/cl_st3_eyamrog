This study identified a phenomenon underlying the spatio-temporal dynamics of
testing rates, incidence, and mortality related to COVID-19 in Minas
Gerais, with particular emphasis on the influence of urban center
hierarchy levels and demographic characteristics of the region. The findings
enhance understanding of the association between territorial dynamics and epidemiological
parameters of COVID-19, providing evidence that may inform the preparation
of health systems and institutional authorities in developing targeted strategies
to address the disease, based on prior knowledge of demographic
and hierarchical features of the territory.
