Poor ventilation in buildings negatively impacts air quality and can
facilitate the transmission of infectious diseases, as microorganisms may be
dispersed through air-conditioning systems. In healthcare facilities with a high
density of infectious patients, existing evidence indicates that inadequate ventilation
increases the risk of disease transmission among patients, healthcare workers,
and visitors. Li et al. [38] demonstrated a correlation between
ventilation rates, air movement within buildings, and the spread of
infectious diseases.
