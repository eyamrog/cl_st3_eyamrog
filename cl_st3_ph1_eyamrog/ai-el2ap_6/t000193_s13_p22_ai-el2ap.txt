Teriflunomide has been associated with lymphopenia; however, a pooled analysis
of the TEMSO, TOWER, TOPIC, and TENERE studies indicated that
low-grade (Grade 1 or Grade 2) lymphopenia was infrequent, and
no cases of high-grade (Grade 3 or Grade 4) lymphopenia
were observed. Additionally, infection rates among patients receiving teriflunomide were
comparable between those with and without low-grade lymphopenia. It is
recommended to perform a complete blood count (CBC) three months
after initiating teriflunomide treatment and subsequently every six months.
