The set of instruments consisted of three independent scales, each
demonstrating a robust factorial structure and measurement invariance, thereby enabling
valid group comparisons. The scales also exhibited stable scores, as
indicated by adequate internal consistency coefficients. Based on the findings,
these instruments are appropriate for assessing job satisfaction among physicians
working in outpatient clinics within the Peruvian health system, given
the nationally representative nature of the data. These instruments have
the potential to serve as effective tools for evaluating various
dimensions of job satisfaction in physicians and may inform decision-making
in human resources management and health services research. The scales
can be administered collectively to provide a comprehensive assessment of
job satisfaction or individually to evaluate specific aspects.
