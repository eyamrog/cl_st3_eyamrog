The protection of healthcare workers and the preparedness of intensive
care units (ICUs) to manage epidemic clusters should be prioritized.
While the role of healthcare workers in facilitating patient-to-patient transmission
of pathogens is well established, emerging evidence indicates that environmental
contamination, particularly of high-touch surfaces, plays a significant role in
the spread of infectious agents. Consequently, healthcare workers are at
an elevated risk of infection [4, 5, 6].
