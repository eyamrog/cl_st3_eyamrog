The use of face masks has become widespread globally. Both
disposable N95 respirators and medical masks are worn by healthcare
workers for self-protection; however, these masks serve different purposes. N95
respirators are designed to protect the wearer by filtering out
small airborne particles and must meet specific filtration standards while
fitting tightly to the face to minimize facial seal leakage.
In contrast, medical masks are primarily intended to prevent the
transmission of microorganisms from the wearer to the patient, fit
the face loosely, and do not reliably prevent the inhalation
of small airborne particles [10].
