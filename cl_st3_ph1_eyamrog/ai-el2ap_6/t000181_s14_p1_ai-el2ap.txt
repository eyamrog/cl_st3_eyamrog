As the initial module of the research project titled "Physical,
Psychological, and Cognitive Reactions to Covid-19," a cross-sectional survey was
conducted from April 12 to 18 with the objective of
assessing peri-traumatic stress and fear as psychological responses during the
Covid-19 pandemic. Data were collected using an online questionnaire distributed
via Google Forms, which served as the primary tool for
gathering participant responses.
