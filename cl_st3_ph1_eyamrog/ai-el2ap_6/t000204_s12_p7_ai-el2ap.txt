According to Hattingh et al. (13), the most significant areas
of activation in individuals with social anxiety disorder include the
bilateral amygdaloid complex, the left medial temporal lobe encompassing the
entorhinal cortex, the left medial aspect of the inferior temporal
lobe including the perirhinal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus, and the
right anterior cingulate cortex. The amygdaloid complex, entorhinal cortex, cingulate
gyrus, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus are all components of the
limbic system, which is the primary encephalic system involved in
the regulation of emotions in humans and other mammals. Furthermore,
individuals with social anxiety disorder exhibit specific cortical thinning in
the right hemisphere, particularly in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and
insular cortices (14).
