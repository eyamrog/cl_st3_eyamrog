During my practicum in the specialization stage, I observed a
doctor attending a woman during childbirth at the hospital. I
was deeply disturbed by the manner in which the woman
was treated; as a student, I felt unable to intervene,
and this experience influenced my initial decision not to pursue
obstetrics. However, I later chose to provide abortion services, viewing
this as a means to address the significant injustices faced
by women within healthcare systems. In my view, medicine serves
as a tool to promote justice for women who are
frequently subjected to inadequate treatment in these settings (L. female,
clinical doctor. Interviews, CÃ³rdoba, November 2018).
