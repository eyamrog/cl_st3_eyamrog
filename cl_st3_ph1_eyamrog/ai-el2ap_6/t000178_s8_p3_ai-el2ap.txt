The representativeness of Latin American data in genome projects and
public databases has been a subject of discussion since the
onset of the genomic era (Ram√≠rez et al. 2002). Data
stored in these databases are essential for investigating the genetic
diversity of indigenous populations (Harris et al. 2018), understanding human
diseases (Norris et al. 2018), and addressing regional biotechnological and
agro-industrial challenges (Sasson & Malpica 2018; Wang et al. 2017).
