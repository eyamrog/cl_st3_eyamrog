Mortality data related to COVID-19 at the territorial level are
essential for evaluating the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and can
also serve as an indirect indicator of the cumulative number
of cases. Furthermore, such data facilitate the assessment of the
quality of healthcare services provided, encompassing prevention, diagnosis, and treatment
of patients. Additionally, these data are valuable for informing the
planning and implementation of strategic measures aimed at interrupting the
transmission cycle of the pathogen.
