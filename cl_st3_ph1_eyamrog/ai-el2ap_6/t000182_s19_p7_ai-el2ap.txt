Neither the fixed action pattern (FAP) nor proboscis extension was
observed in the Y-olfactometer assays; only chemotactic responses were detected
in certain instances. When one arm of the Y-olfactometer contained
headspace volatiles from live cockroaches and the other contained clean
air, B. corredori (P=0.005), B. ferroae (P=0.04), and B. herreri
(P=0.014) exhibited significant avoidance of the odorous air current (Fig.
3). A chi-square test of independence indicated no significant association
between species and behavioral responses (P=0.347). Overall, individuals of the
genus Belminus (n=52) avoided cockroach-emitted volatiles in 79% of trials
(P=0.000013).
