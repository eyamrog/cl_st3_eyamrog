We estimated that states in the southeast and north regions,
specifically Rio de Janeiro, Roraima, and Par√°, will experience substantial
increases in cumulative COVID-19 death rates, with projected monthly increases
of 5.39, 13.36, and 4.20 times, and cumulative increases of
11.23, 15.97, and 4.41 times, respectively, by July 15. Additionally,
the states of Amazonas (north region) and Pernambuco (northeast region)
appear to be entering a potential stabilization phase in terms
of death cases, with only slight increases in mortality rates
(2.17 and 2.44 times, respectively); however, these states are still
expected to remain among those with the highest death rates
at the end of the observation period. In contrast, states
in the midwest and south regions are projected to exhibit
more moderate increases, with the lowest potential cumulative case rates
by the end of the estimated period.
