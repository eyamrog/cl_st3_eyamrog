The novel coronavirus epidemic (2019-nCoV), first identified in Wuhan, China,
in December 2019, is primarily characterized by pulmonary pneumonia, typically
preceded by symptoms such as fever, cough, and myalgia. As
the disease spread globally and the number of hospitalizations increased,
it became evident that patients with severe COVID-19 frequently exhibit
significant laboratory abnormalities, including lymphopenia, neutrophilia, prolonged prothrombin time, and
elevated D-dimer levels. These hematological changes have been shown to
be critical determinants of morbidity and mortality in this patient
population, prompting numerous studies investigating the pathophysiology of COVID-19, with
a particular focus on hematological aspects. Recent research has demonstrated
that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with the development of a
prothrombotic state in hospitalized patients, increasing the risk of thrombotic
and arterial events. In this context, the present study aims
to review the literature regarding the protocols implemented in vascular
services during the COVID-19 pandemic and to examine the roles
of vascular surgeons and angiologists in the clinical and surgical
management of both infected and non-infected patients. The objective is
to provide a comprehensive overview that may assist and inform
the vascular specialty during the ongoing pandemic. The literature search
was conducted using the following terms: “Coronavirus and venous thrombosis,”
“Coronavirus and thrombosis,” “COVID-19 and venous thrombosis,” and “COVID-19 Coronavirus
and thrombosis.”
