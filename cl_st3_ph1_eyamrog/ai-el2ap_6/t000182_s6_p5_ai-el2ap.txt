Belminus is capable of detecting thermal cues while feeding on
humans and other homeothermic vertebrates; however, it shows a preference
for poikilothermic arthropods as hosts (Sandoval et al. 2013), whose
body temperatures are generally lower than those of warm-blooded vertebrates.
Wigglesworth and Gillett (1934a, b) proposed that triatomines are primarily
attracted to hosts by warmth, and Vinauger et al. (2013)
reported that heat is the only necessary and sufficient stimulus
to trigger the proboscis extension response (PER), as previously described
by Flores and Lazzari (1996). Haridass and Ananthakrishnan (1980) further
stated that, in hematophagous T. rubrofasciata, feeding behavior is elicited
exclusively by temperature gradients from vertebrate hosts, similar to other
blood-feeding insects. Contrary to these assertions, our findings indicate that
feeding behavior in all Triatomine subspecies is not exclusively driven
by heat. Consistent with previous research, visual, olfactory, and tactile
stimuli can also initiate the fixed action pattern (FAP) associated
with feeding (Páez-Rondón et al. 2018). In the present study,
we confirmed that non-thermal cues from poikilothermic insects elicit both
positive taxis and the FAP in Belminus species. This flexibility
in stimulus elicitation for orientation and feeding behaviors was likely
a key factor in the behavioral shift that enabled ancestral
predatory reduviids to adopt kleptophagy, thereby influencing the evolutionary trajectory
of Triatominae. It is plausible that early triatomines initially fed
on abundant soft-bodied invertebrates found in the nests and burrows
of vertebrates, subsequently encountering and feeding on the vulnerable offspring
of these vertebrates (Otálora-Luna et al. 2015). Over time, morphological
adaptations such as the specialized and flexible proboscis, along with
changes in saliva composition toward reduced toxicity and increased analgesic
properties, facilitated the transition to kleptophagy (sensu Portmann 1967), contributing
to the emergence of triatomines as a distinct group within
Reduviidae. Ultimately, this flexibility in stimulus response may have also
promoted the domestication of several sylvatic species, including Belminus sp.
