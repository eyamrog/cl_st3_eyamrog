Further research is required to compare Peruvian regions across various
dimensions of job satisfaction, an objective not addressed in the
present study. Additionally, the identification of a gold standard for
job satisfaction measurement is necessary to facilitate studies on sensitivity
and specificity. It is recommended that the measurement properties of
the three scales presented be evaluated in other contexts; to
support this, the Spanish and English versions of the scales
are provided in Supplement 1 and Supplement 2, respectively. In
particular, the psychometric properties of the English version warrant evaluation,
as it currently represents only a preliminary proposal by the
authors.
