In 2002 and 2003, the first major coronavirus outbreak emerged
in Guangdong province, China, resulting in 8,098 reported cases and
774 deaths globally, corresponding to a mortality rate of approximately
9% (Fehr and Perlman 2015). This outbreak was identified as
the cause of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). In 2012,
a subsequent outbreak occurred in the Middle East, known as
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which initially exhibited a mortality
rate close to 50% but was subsequently brought under greater
control. By 2014, MERS-CoV had resulted in 855 reported cases
and 333 deaths, reflecting a mortality rate of 40%, as
documented by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control
(Fehr and Perlman 2015). Prior to these outbreaks, coronaviruses were
generally considered to cause only mild, self-limiting respiratory tract infections
in humans.
