The PubMed search algorithm was as follows: (("malnutrition"[MeSH Terms] OR
"malnutrition"[All Fields] OR ("nutritional"[All Fields] AND "deficiency"[All Fields]) OR "nutritional
deficiency"[All Fields]) AND ("vitamin a"[MeSH Terms] OR "vitamin a"[All Fields]))
AND ("respiratory tract infections"[MeSH Terms] OR ("respiratory"[All Fields] AND "tract"[All
Fields] AND "infections"[All Fields]) OR "respiratory tract infections"[All Fields]). The
search terms were subsequently modified to include articles addressing other
micronutrients as well as additional infectious conditions, specifically influenza and
coronavirus.
