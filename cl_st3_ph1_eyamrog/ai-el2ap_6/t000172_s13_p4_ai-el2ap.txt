The subsequent stages of coronavirus replication and transcription are depicted
in Figure 2. Following their synthesis and processing, a subset
of non-structural proteins, including nsp12—the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)—assemble to
form the Replication and Transcription Complex (RTC). The primary function
of the RTC is to generate a series of single-stranded
negative-sense RNAs (ssRNA-), which include both full-length genomic and subgenomic
RNAs. These negative-sense intermediates serve as templates for the synthesis
of new genomic RNA and subgenomic mRNAs, respectively. The abundance
of these negative-sense RNA intermediates is approximately 1% of their
corresponding positive-sense RNAs, and they contain anti-leader sequences located in
the 5’ untranslated region (UTR) of the antigenome and the
3’-UTR of the genome (Sethna et al., 1991). Conversely, leader
sequences are present in the 5’-UTR of the viral genome
and the 3’-UTR of the antigenome. The RTC utilizes these
leader and anti-leader sequences to initiate replication and transcription. Additionally,
the 5’-UTR of the genome and the regions upstream of
each open reading frame (ORF) encoding structural proteins contain regulatory
elements known as Transcriptional Regulatory Sequences (TRS), as illustrated in
Figures 1 and 2. According to the current model of
coronavirus replication (Pasternak et al., 2006; Sawicki et al., 2007),
two distinct mechanisms may occur during the transcription of ssRNA
molecules.
