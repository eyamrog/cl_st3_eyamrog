The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated modifications in the management and
monitoring of patients with central nervous system demyelinating diseases. Currently,
there is no evidence indicating that individuals with multiple sclerosis
(MS) or neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) who contract COVID-19
are at increased risk of developing severe disease compared to
the general population. However, due to the frequent use of
immunosuppressive therapies in these patients, heightened caution and ongoing surveillance
are warranted. Management strategies must be adapted during the pandemic
to minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection while ensuring the
continued safety and efficacy of disease-modifying treatments.
