The article screening process was conducted in three stages: title
review, abstract review, and full-text review. Following the evaluation of
titles and abstracts, full-text articles were assessed to determine compliance
with the inclusion criteria as defined by the pre-established protocol.
The authors independently evaluated the articles and subsequently convened to
compare and confirm the extracted data, thereby minimizing bias and
heterogeneity in the analyses.
