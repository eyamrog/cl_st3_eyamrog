The taxonomic identification of the collected specimens was conducted using
both macromorphological and micromorphological characteristics, following the methodologies described by
Teixeira (1995) and Ryvarden (2004). All specimens were deposited in
the Herbarium of the Universidade Estadual de Goi√°s (HUEG).
