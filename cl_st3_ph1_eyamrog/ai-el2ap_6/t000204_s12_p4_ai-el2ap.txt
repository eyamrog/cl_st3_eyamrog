In the context of significant changes and uncertainties, individuals commonly
experience both unconditioned and conditioned fear, as well as chronic
anxiety. While these responses can serve adaptive functions by promoting
caution and preventive behaviors, they may also escalate to levels
that are intolerable, dysfunctional, or pathological. Prophylactic social isolation, implemented
as a strategy to reduce viral transmission and previously utilized
during other critical periods, presents several risks to mental health.
Evidence indicates that prolonged isolation is associated with an increased
risk of developing psychiatric disorders.
