The questionnaire was adapted from Ross-Hellauer et al. (2017) to
fit the context of this study and was translated into
Portuguese and Spanish by the authors. As the original questionnaire
provides definitions for its key terms, including traditional peer review
and each aspect of open peer review, and had previously
undergone pilot testing and administration by Ross-Hellauer et al. (2017),
the present study limited pilot testing to the evaluation of
the translation and functionality. This was achieved by having the
authors and several colleagues review and complete the translated questionnaire.
