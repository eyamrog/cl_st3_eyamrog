Phase I: B. ferroae nymphs exhibited positive thigmotaxis by walking
along the sidewall of the 10-cm dish (Fig 1A). In
contrast, the nymphs rarely explored the edge of the 5-cm
dish containing the cockroach, with only two individuals doing so
on separate occasions. Most nymphs displayed a swinging locomotion along
the perimeter of the 10-cm dish, alternating between clockwise and
counterclockwise directions, with their movement typically covering, but rarely exceeding,
180°. Their walking was intermittent, with pauses accounting for approximately
20% of the observation period. The cockroach made several escape
attempts by moving within the confined space and occasionally colliding
with the sidewall. No clear interactions were observed between the
triatomine nymphs and the cockroach despite their close proximity. Phase
II: Upon release, the cockroach exhibited increased locomotor activity and
positive thigmotaxis, although its movement was discontinuous and interspersed with
pauses. The triatomine nymph ceased its thigmotactic behavior and remained
motionless for approximately 5 seconds before orienting toward the cockroach
and elevating the anterior part of its body (~40°) by
extending its forelegs, thereby raising its antennae (~60° relative to
the ground) in a behavior termed "reaching." The nymph continuously
waved its antennae in a semaphore-like motion (~30°). When the
cockroach stopped moving, the nymph discontinued the reaching behavior and
approached the cockroach cautiously by lowering the anterior part of
its body through foreleg flexion, a behavior referred to as
"stalking" (Fig 1B). During this approach, the walking velocity of
the nymph was substantially reduced compared to Phase I. The
nymph then contacted the cockroach's abdomen with its antennae ("antennal
exploration"), extended its proboscis, briefly pierced the cockroach's abdomen (~2
seconds), and subsequently withdrew. The flexibility of the proboscis enabled
the nymph to pierce the cockroach from below (Fig 1Ca).
Approximately 10 seconds after being pierced, the cockroach exhibited alternating
spasms and slow, uncoordinated movements, along with clear signs of
disorientation. In this state, the cockroach no longer displayed positive
thigmotaxis but instead moved slowly and erratically over a wider
area. The nymph then approached the cockroach again in a
similar cautious manner and inserted its stylets; on this occasion,
it fed on the cockroach's hemolymph for approximately 2 minutes,
repeating this kleptophagic behavior two or more times. The abdomen
of the triatomine nymph became visibly distended. Based on these
observations, the fixed action pattern (FAP) of Belminus can be
categorized into the following stereotyped behaviors: (1) visual and/or olfactory
detection of the cockroach, (2) reaching, (3) cautious approach, (4)
antennal exploration, (5) proboscis extension, (6) piercing to sedate, (7)
walking away and waiting (post-sedation behavior), (8) second cautious approach,
(9) proboscis extension, and (10) piercing to feed on hemolymph.
Steps 8–10 were repeated multiple times. The cockroach did not
die during the observation period.
