During pandemics, children's nutrition represents a critical issue for society,
particularly because schools often serve as the primary source of
daily nutritional support for many children. Monitoring whether food or
financial assistance provided by governments actually reaches and is consumed
by the intended child beneficiaries presents significant challenges. When such
resources are distributed to families rather than directly to children,
there is limited oversight regarding the proper allocation and use
of these provisions, making it difficult to assess the effectiveness
of these interventions in addressing nutritional deficiencies.
