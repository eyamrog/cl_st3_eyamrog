Results indicated positive correlations between the rate of rapid tests
and incidence, as well as between the rate of RT-PCR
tests and both incidence and mortality. At the municipal level,
incidence, mortality, and the rates of rapid and RT-PCR tests
were negatively correlated with the number of days elapsed since
the first notified case. Similar patterns were observed at the
level of health macro-regions, although the strength of these correlations
varied.
