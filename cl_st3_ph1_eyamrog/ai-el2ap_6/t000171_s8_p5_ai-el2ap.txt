According to the most recent update of the human infection
protocol for SARS-CoV-2 released by the Government of the State
of Minas Gerais on July 20, both reverse transcription followed
by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays and immunological techniques, including
rapid tests, are accepted as diagnostic criteria. However, it is
important to note that negative results from rapid tests are
insufficient to rule out suspected cases (6).
