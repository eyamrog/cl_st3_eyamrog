Adopting a bioecological perspective, previous research on pandemics has identified
a substantial and diverse array of psychosocial impacts on individuals
during infectious disease outbreaks. At the micro level, individuals are
likely to experience fear of illness or death, feelings of
helplessness, and social stigma (Wang et al., 2020), as well
as concerns regarding health threats to themselves and their loved
ones. Additionally, there is an increased risk of experiencing mood
disturbances, depression, irritability, anxiety, fear, anger, insomnia, changes in appetite,
and alterations in subjective well-being (Abad et al., 2020).
