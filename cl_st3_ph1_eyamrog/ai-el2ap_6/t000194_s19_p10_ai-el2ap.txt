The species was first described by Anastasiou (1964) as Dactyllela
appendiculata, characterized by the presence of appendages. It produces either
curved conidia, when derived from a curved spore primordium, or
straight conidia, when derived from a straight spore primordium. Subsequently,
Nawawi (1976) established the new genus Laridospora and recombined Dactyllela
appendiculata as Laridospora appendiculata, observing only curved conidia and appendages.
Rubner and Gams later classified L. appendiculata as Monacrosporium tentaculatum,
based solely on its predatory behavior, without considering ecological factors
or the presence of conidial appendages associated with aquatic habitats,
noting that M. tentaculatum is not an aquatic species (Rubner
1996). Finally, molecular analyses by Scholler et al. (1999) determined
that M. tentaculatum is synonymous with Dactyllelina appendiculata. This study
represents the first record of D. appendiculata in Brazil.
