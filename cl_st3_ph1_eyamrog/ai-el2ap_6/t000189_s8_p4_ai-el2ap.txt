Given the limited scientific evidence on the impact of nutritional
deficiencies on the prognosis of viral infections, and in light
of the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, this study aimed to
review the literature to evaluate the effects of deficiencies in
vitamin A, vitamin D, iron, zinc, or folate on the
prognosis of patients with respiratory infections exhibiting symptoms similar to
those of COVID-19, and to discuss the potential role of
supplementation with these nutrients as considered in the qualitative analysis
of this review.
