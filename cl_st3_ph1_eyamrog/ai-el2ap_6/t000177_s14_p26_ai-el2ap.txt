Open windows in toilets equipped with passive stack or mechanical
exhaust systems can facilitate the transfer of contaminated air from
the toilet to adjacent rooms. Therefore, it is recommended that
toilet windows remain closed under these conditions. In situations where
adequate exhaust ventilation is not available in toilets and it
is not possible to avoid window airflow, it is advisable
to keep windows open in other areas of the building
to promote cross-ventilation.
