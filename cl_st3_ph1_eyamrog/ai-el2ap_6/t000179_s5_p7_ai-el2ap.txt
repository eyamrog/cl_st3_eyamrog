The number of studies that have evaluated measurement invariance in
job satisfaction scales is limited, resulting in few instruments with
sufficient evidence to support group comparisons. Despite this, comparisons between
groups are frequently conducted even in the absence of adequate
evidence, which may lead to biased results if measurement invariance
is not established. For example, one study demonstrated measurement invariance
by comparing physicians and nurses from 14 European countries, indicating
that cultural factors may permit the assessment of different organizational
variables among these professionals over time. In the present study,
measurement invariance of the scales was tested, enabling valid comparisons
across groups defined by marital status, presence of occupational or
chronic diseases, and, for the working conditions and health center
management scales, by sex, age group, medical specialty, employment at
another institution, and length of service. The results indicate that
these group comparisons are not affected by measurement bias.
