The satisfaction scale for general professional activity demonstrated a KMO
value greater than 0.90, indicating an adequate sample size for
conducting exploratory factor analysis. Parallel analysis suggested the presence of
two potential dimensions, whereas Kaiser's criterion indicated a single dimension.
Given this discrepancy, both one-dimensional and two-dimensional models were evaluated.
The one-dimensional model exhibited adequate factor loadings (Î» > 0.4;
see Table 2), while the two-dimensional model did not satisfy
the requirement of having at least three items per dimension.
Consequently, the two-dimensional model was excluded from further analyses.
