Minas Gerais (MG) plays a significant role at the national
level as it is the second most populous state in
Brazil, with an estimated population of 21 million people. Its
location is considered strategic due to its proximity to states
with high COVID-19 incidence rates, such as SÃ£o Paulo and
Rio de Janeiro, which increases the potential for the transmission
of the disease.
