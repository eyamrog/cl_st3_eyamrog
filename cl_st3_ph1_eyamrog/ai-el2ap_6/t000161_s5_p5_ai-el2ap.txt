Exploring biodiversity is a fundamental concern within the biological sciences
and is of significant importance to humanity. In this context,
taxonomic research is recognized as a critical priority in response
to the current biodiversity crisis (Wheeler et al. 2012). The
concept of taxonomy in biological sciences encompasses a range of
interpretations, from the reductionist and primarily descriptive approach known as
alpha taxonomy—which has been criticized as outdated and of limited
intellectual value (e.g., Mayr 1969)—to a broader perspective that positions
taxonomy as a central discipline within comparative biology (e.g., Wheeler
2008). The latter, which is the perspective adopted in this
study, includes activities ranging from primary data collection during fieldwork
to analyses involving morphology, genomics, and ecosystems, thereby framing taxonomy
as a hypothesis-driven science. Despite its broad scientific relevance, routine
taxonomic research is typically a low-cost endeavor that utilizes limited
technological resources and is primarily focused on the examination of
natural history collections to generate and disseminate fundamental data on
biological entities. This work often involves the morphological study of
poorly known taxa, uncharacterized sexes or developmental stages, and undescribed
species. Taxonomists frequently address understudied or neglected topics, often working
with novel or unusual organisms. As a result, comprehensive and
well-illustrated taxonomic monographs on certain animal groups may receive few
citations, potentially because they resolve most of the fundamental taxonomic
issues for those taxa. For example, during the Brazilian Congress
of Zoology in 2014, an entomologist highlighted the limited citation
potential for significant contributions to the study of Zoraptera, a
small insect order with fewer than fifty described species. The
issue of low citation rates in taxonomy is widely recognized,
and the inadequacy of journal impact factors (JIF) for evaluating
basic sciences has been frequently discussed (e.g., Krell 2000, Rafael
et al. 2009). This situation reflects a paradox in which
taxonomy, by necessity, addresses basic descriptive topics and novel discoveries
that pertain to relatively small segments of the tree of
life.
