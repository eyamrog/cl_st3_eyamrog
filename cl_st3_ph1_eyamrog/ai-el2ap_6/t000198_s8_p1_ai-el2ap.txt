Coronaviruses (CoV) are a group of viruses characterized by the
presence of ribonucleic acid (RNA) as their genetic material [1].
These viruses primarily infect epithelial cells in the respiratory and
gastrointestinal tracts, enabling transmission through various routes, including fomites, airborne
particles, and the faecal-oral pathway [2]. In early January 2020,
the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified a
novel coronavirus, designated as SARS-CoV-2, as the causative agent of
a newly recognized human disease, COVID-19 [3]. In late January
2020, the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency
of international concern, followed by the declaration of a global
pandemic in March 2020 [4]. As of 4 June 2020,
COVID-19 had affected 213 countries and territories, resulting in over
6 million confirmed cases and nearly 400,000 deaths worldwide [5].
