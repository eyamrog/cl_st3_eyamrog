Graphic organizers are effective tools for addressing diverse learning styles
among students. They are particularly beneficial for visual learners, as
they facilitate the comprehension of symbols and key terms. Additionally,
graphic organizers provide a varied and engaging approach to learning.
Empirical studies have demonstrated that graphic organizers are valuable not
only as preparatory activities but also as follow-up learning tasks
(Dishner, Bean, & Readence, 1981).
