In light of the above, and in addition to contributing
to the ongoing discussion of this significant and urgent issue,
this study aims to present the types of transfers—specifically food
and/or cash rations—implemented by Brazilian state authorities for children and
adolescents who are not attending school, and to propose strategies
for monitoring and controlling the use of these transfers by
families, with the objective of mitigating the risks associated with
food insecurity among students during the COVID-19 pandemic.
