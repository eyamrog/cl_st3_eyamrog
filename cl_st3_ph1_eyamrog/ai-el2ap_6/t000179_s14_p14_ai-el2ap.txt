In addition, our analysis incorporated demographic, professional, and economic variables.
The demographic variables included sex, age, and marital status, specifically
whether participants were currently living with a partner. Professional variables
assessed were specialty status (categorized as yes, in process, or
no), employment at additional institutions (yes/no), self-reported work-related illness (yes/no),
type of employing organization (Ministry of Health, EsSalud, Armed Forces
and National Police, or private clinics), and duration of employment.
Economic information was collected through self-reported monthly income, which was
categorized based on multiples of the minimum wage: less than
four times, four to ten times, and more than ten
times the minimum wage. The minimum wage was defined as
750 Peruvian soles (PEN), equivalent to US$222.5, using an exchange
rate of 3.37 soles per US dollar.
