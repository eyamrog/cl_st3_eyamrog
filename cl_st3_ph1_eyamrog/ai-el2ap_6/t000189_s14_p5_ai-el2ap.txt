The article selection criteria included original observational studies conducted with
individuals presenting respiratory infections that exhibited symptoms similar to those
of COVID-19, published between 2010 and 2020 in English, Spanish,
or Portuguese. The assessment of symptom similarity between the respiratory
infections considered in this review and COVID-19 was based on
the Epidemiological Bulletin on 2019-nCoV [13], which identifies a broad
clinical spectrum shared by COVID-19 and other respiratory infections, including
manifestations such as cough, fever, shortness of breath, and, in
severe cases, pneumonia.
