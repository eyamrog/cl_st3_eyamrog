The Covid-19 pandemic has continued to spread rapidly worldwide, with
the Americas being particularly affected. By mid-June 2020, Brazil was
among the countries most impacted, reporting over one million confirmed
cases and approximately 50,000 deaths. This study aims to assess
levels of fear and peri-traumatic stress among the Brazilian population
during the Covid-19 pandemic, with the objective of informing infection
control strategies, targeted interventions, and public health policies. A cross-sectional
survey was conducted from April 12 to 18, utilizing the
Peri-Traumatic Distress Scale (CPDI) and the Fear of Covid-19 Scale
(FCV-19S) to measure psychological responses to the pandemic. Data were
collected via an online questionnaire distributed to a sample of
1,844 participants. The two scales demonstrated a correlation coefficient of
r = 0.660. The results indicate significant gender differences, with
women reporting higher mean scores on both scales. These findings
underscore the importance of incorporating gender perspectives into policy development,
as socially constructed gender roles may influence psychological responses and
position women to contribute to the design and implementation of
multi-level interventions and equitable public health policies during the Covid-19
pandemic.
