It has been two years since Norena et al. (2018)
published the initial analysis of Latin American genetic data available
in public databases. The authors provided their scripts and relevant
information, enabling us to reproduce and compare their results. In
alignment with the principles of open science, all scripts and
results from the present study are freely accessible and downloadable
from GitHub. Norena et al. reported that 1.01% (approximately 6,500)
of the records in NCBI Nucleotide were deposited by Peruvian
institutions. Our analysis indicates that this number has more than
doubled to 14,488 records within two years (Table 1). However,
the calculated proportion of records from Peruvian institutions increased only
modestly to 1.71%, likely due to the overall growth in
the total number of Nucleotide records. An independent study by
Clark et al. (2016) observed two- to four-fold increases in
both invertebrate and vertebrate data in GenBank over a comparable
period (2014â€“2016). For Peru, the National Institute of Health (INS)
and the National University of San Marcos (UNMSM) have contributed
more data than all other Peruvian institutions combined, accounting for
over 8,000 records. In the BioProject database, we identified that
30.05% of records (58 out of 193) were submitted by
Peruvian institutions, which is approximately double the proportion reported by
Norena et al. (15.95%). In PATRIC, Norena et al. found
that 0.28% of records were submitted by Peruvian institutions, whereas
our analysis identified 3.62% (107 out of 2,959 records). Finally,
in BOLD, we recorded 3,754 entries compared to the 3,438
reported by Norena et al., indicating a smaller increase in
this database relative to the others.
