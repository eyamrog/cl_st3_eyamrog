In the article "Mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic
on food and nutrition of schoolchildren," UNESCO reports that financial

the card typically used for purchasing school supplies. The article
states that the amount of financial support allocated to each
family was determined based on the number of meals that
children would ordinarily receive at school on a daily basis
