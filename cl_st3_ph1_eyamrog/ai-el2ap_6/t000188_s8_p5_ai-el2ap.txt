In collaboration with the Ministry of Health of Brazil, the
Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has developed a range of
tools to support governmental decision-making regarding the implementation or relaxation
of public health measures. Among these tools is the technical
guide titled “Considerations on Adjustments to Social Distance Measures and
Travel-Related Measures in the Context of the Response to the
COVID-19 Pandemic.” Additionally, the “Epidemic Calculator” is a tool designed
to generate scenarios—rather than forecasts—based on input values, data, and
parameters such as the number of available hospital beds, transmission
rates, and levels of social contact. The accuracy and utility
of the model are contingent upon the quality of the
information provided for its calculations.
