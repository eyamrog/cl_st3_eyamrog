The average incidence of leptospirosis in Santa Catarina was 2.02
cases per millimeter of rainfall. This value ranged from 0.16
cases per precipitation index (PI) in Serra Catarinense to 7.8
cases per PI in the Northeast region. Among the five
regions previously identified as having the highest leptospirosis rates, four
regions—Foz do Rio Itajaí, Médio Vale do Itajaí, Grande Florianópolis,
and the Northeast region—also exhibited the highest numbers of cases
per unit of PI. These four regions accounted for 71.8%
of all leptospirosis cases reported in Santa Catarina during the
study period.
