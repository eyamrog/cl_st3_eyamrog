Coronaviruses have been the subject of virological research since the
mid-1960s. Environmental contamination, which may result from respiratory secretions of
patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, has been identified as a potential
route of transmission. This underscores the necessity for strict adherence
to environmental and hand hygiene protocols. Within this context, healthcare
professionals are recognized as a high-risk group for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
