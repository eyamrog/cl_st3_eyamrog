A recent study by Vâ€™kovski et al. (2019) investigated cellular
pathways associated with the coronavirus replication-transcription complex (RTC) using mouse
hepatitis virus (MHV) as a model system. The study demonstrated
that the RTC interacts with translation initiation factors, although these
interactions may be transient and limited to specific phases of
the viral replication cycle. Furthermore, knockdown of certain translation initiation
factors, including eIF3E, eIF3F, and eIF3I, resulted in a reduction
of MHV replication. The study also identified associations between the
RTC and proteins involved in transport and intracellular organization.
