Following the implementation of reading activities incorporating graphic organizers over
a six-week period, the majority of students in the experimental

Additionally, they exhibited statistically significant improvements in receptive skills, including
listening and concentration, as well as in reading comprehension and
learning skills such as vocabulary decoding and the ability to
relate new content to prior knowledge.
