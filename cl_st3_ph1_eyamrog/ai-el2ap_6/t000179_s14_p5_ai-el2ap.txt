During the first half of 2014, a multidisciplinary technical team
comprising members from the Health Services Quality Directorate of the
Ministry of Health, the Research and Development Intendance of SUSALUD,
and the Peruvian National Institute of Statistics developed 53 preliminary
scales to assess various aspects of the work of health
professionals (physicians and nurses), along with additional sociodemographic data (18).
These scales were informed by a review of the literature
and by operational tools previously utilized by the Ministry of
Health. Each preliminary scale consisted of between 1 and 22
items and was included in the initial version of ENSUSALUD
2014, a national survey. The preliminary scales comprised groups of
items derived from pre-existing instruments or were designed ad hoc
to evaluate the Peruvian health system; however, their measurement properties
had not yet been assessed. In ENSUSALUD 2015, the same
technical team reused the 53 preliminary scales from the 2014
survey, incorporated additional preliminary scales, and revised the wording of
certain items based on prior experience (19).
