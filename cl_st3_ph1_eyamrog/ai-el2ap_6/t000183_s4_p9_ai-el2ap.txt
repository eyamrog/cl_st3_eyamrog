The use of innovative instructional methods, such as graphic organizers,
to motivate reading is encouraged because effective reading skills contribute
not only to daily functioning and comprehension of texts in
both the first language and English, but also to the
development of other important cognitive abilities. Furthermore, improved reading proficiency
is associated with increased vocabulary knowledge and enhanced text comprehension,
which can lead to greater student motivation.
