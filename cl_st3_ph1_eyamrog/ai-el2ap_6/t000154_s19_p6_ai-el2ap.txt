Open interaction received the highest level of support, with most
participants indicating that it would improve peer review (Table 3)
and agreeing that it would lead to higher-quality publications (Table
4). A similar proportion of participants believed that open final-version
commenting would enhance peer review (Table 3); however, relatively few
supported post-publication peer review conducted through blog articles, online journal
clubs, or social media (Table 4). Support for open participation,
open pre-review manuscripts, and open platforms was somewhat lower than
for open peer review overall, but remained higher than the
support observed for open identities (Table 3, Table 4).
