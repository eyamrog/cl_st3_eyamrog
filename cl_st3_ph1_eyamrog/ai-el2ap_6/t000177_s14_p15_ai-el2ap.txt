Research has shown that effective air filtration reduces the transmission
of virus particles, which are often associated with larger particulate
matter, into downstream environments. High-efficiency filters, when properly installed, are
capable of removing particles of relevant sizes according to their
rated capture efficiency. The National Air Filtration Association (NAFA) has
indicated that appropriately sized, maintained, and operated portable HEPA filters
can provide measurable benefits in particle removal. Additionally, a study
by the National Air Duct Cleaners Association (NADCA) recommends that
HVAC systems be inspected at least twice annually to ensure
optimal performance.
