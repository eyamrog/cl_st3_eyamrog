Most triatomine bugs (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Triatominae) are hematophagous; however, species
of the genus Belminus are capable of completing their life
cycle by feeding on cockroach hemolymph. In this study, we
describe the fixed action pattern (FAP) exhibited by B. ferroae
during the identification, approach, and feeding on a living cockroach.
The FAP consists of the following stereotyped behaviors: (1) visual
and/or olfactory detection of the cockroach, (2) reaching, (3) cautious
approach, (4) antennal exploration, (5) extension of the proboscis, (6)
piercing to sedate, (7) walking away and waiting (post-sedation behavior),
(8) second cautious approach, (9) extension of the proboscis, and
(10) piercing to extract hemolymph. To identify chemical cues that
may elicit this FAP, we examined the behavioral responses of
B. corredori, B. ferroae, and B. herreri to cockroach odor,
fresh cockroach feces, and fresh rodent wastes. The latter two
sources were included based on the hypothesis that chemical cues
abundant near host refuges may facilitate host orientation. Our results
indicate that cockroach odor emanating from a box significantly attracted
B. herreri in a still-air olfactometer. All three Belminus species
approached the captive cockroach after one hour but did not
climb onto the box. Odors from cockroach feces attracted B.
corredori and B. ferroae in a Y-olfactometer. The observed FAP
sequence suggests that Belminus species are kleptophagous ectoparasites rather than
predators, as they do not kill their invertebrate hosts but
instead extract hemolymph. Triatomines and their hosts have cohabited the
same refuges for millions of years. The presence of similar
odors in both invertebrate and vertebrate refuges, including human dwellings,
may explain the ability of these kleptophagous bugs to adapt
to domestic environments.
