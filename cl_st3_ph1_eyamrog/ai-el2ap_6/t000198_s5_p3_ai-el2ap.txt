Following the conclusion of the spring term (January through April),
the summer term (April to July) continued to deliver courses
online, and preparations were undertaken to provide clinical experiences for
students in the treatment care phase of their training. A
combination of recorded clinical procedures and in-depth discussions of clinical
scenarios was implemented to offer students some exposure to clinical
practice while awaiting state authorization to resume in-person clinical activities.
Modifications were made to the physical layout of the dental
clinics and pre-clinical laboratories to minimize the risk of COVID-19
transmission, ensuring that students could maintain appropriate physical distancing while
working. The resumption of these activities is planned to occur
within one month.
