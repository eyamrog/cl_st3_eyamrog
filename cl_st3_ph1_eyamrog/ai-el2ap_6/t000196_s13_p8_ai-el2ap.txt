In addition to Brazil, several other countries have implemented financial
assistance programs for families. For example, the United States provides
support through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), while Peru
distributes cash transfers via the Qali Warma National School Food
Program. According to the World Food Programme (WFP), at least
ten countries have adopted strategies involving cash transfers to family
members to address this issue. Although such measures can be
effective in alleviating food insecurity, families may continue to encounter
challenges, including the costs associated with food preparation, which can
be particularly burdensome in contexts of high unemployment.
