A comprehensive ethological, behavioral, systematic, and evolutionary understanding of Triatominae
is essential for the development of novel control programs. In
particular, investigating the instinctive behaviors of Belminus and other triatomine
species is critical for designing experiments that aim to improve
control technologies.
