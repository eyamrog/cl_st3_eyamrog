Therapeutic doses of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated
heparin (UFH) are recommended exclusively for patients with a confirmed
diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) or as a bridging strategy
for individuals already receiving oral anticoagulant therapy, as the use
of oral anticoagulants may significantly interact with antiretroviral treatment in
patients with COVID-19.
