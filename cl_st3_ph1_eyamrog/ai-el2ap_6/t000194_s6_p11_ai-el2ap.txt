In Ilhabela State Park, 39 species of freshwater Hyphomycetes have
been documented. Among these, Camposporidium cristatum Nawawi & Kuthub., Chaetendophragmia
triangularis Matsush., Physalidiella elegans (Mosca) Rulamort, and Scutisporus brunneus K.
Ando & Tubaki represent new records for the state of
SÃ£o Paulo. Additionally, Isthmolongispora biramifera Matsush., Lateriramulosa ainflata Matsush., Phalangispora
nawawii Kuthub., and Triscelophorus ponapensis Matsush. are reported as new
records for Brazil. Fiuza et al. (2017) compiled a checklist
of Ingoldian fungi in Brazil, identifying 85 taxa, with 19
taxa reported from the Amazon, 53 from the Atlantic Forest,
39 from the Caatinga, and 21 from the Cerrado. Furthermore,
Silva et al. (2019) reported 23 taxa of aquatic hyphomycetes
