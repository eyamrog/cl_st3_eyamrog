We hypothesize that the abrupt change in the increasing trend
observed around April 5th is attributable to the social distancing
measures implemented in SÃ£o Paulo State between March 16th and
March 22nd. During this period, state decrees mandated remote work
and the closure of non-essential businesses and educational institutions across
the state. The observed time lag of approximately 17 days
aligns with previously reported estimates of the average interval between
symptom onset and death, which is 17.8 days.
