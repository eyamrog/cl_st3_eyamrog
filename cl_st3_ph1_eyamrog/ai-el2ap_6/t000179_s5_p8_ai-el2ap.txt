We observed stable scores across the three scales. Compared to
other instruments, our scales are relatively brief while demonstrating acceptable
internal consistency. This is noteworthy because many existing scales, such
as the Warr-Cook-Wall Job Satisfaction Scale, often exhibit limited variability
and require a large number of items to achieve stable
measurements.
