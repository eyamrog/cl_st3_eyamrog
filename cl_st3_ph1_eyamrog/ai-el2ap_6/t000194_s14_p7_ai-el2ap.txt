Taxonomical identification: Beginning on the fifth day, fragments of the
leaf litter samples were examined microscopically for a minimum period
of one month, and observations continued until no additional fungal
taxa were detected. For microscopic analysis, fragments of the incubated
leaf samples were mounted on slides with a drop of
sterile water and covered with cover glasses, then observed using
an Olympus BX50 optical microscope.
