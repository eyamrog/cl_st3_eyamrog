The twenty-four questions were administered using a Likert scale with
five response options: never, occasionally, sometimes, often, and most of
the time. According to the authors, total scores range from
0 to 100, with scores between 28 and 51 indicating
mild to moderate distress and scores of 52 or higher
indicating severe distress. The content validity of the CPDI was
established by psychiatrists at the Shanghai Mental Health Center, and
the instrument demonstrated high internal consistency, with a Cronbachâ€™s alpha
of 0.95 (p<0.001) (Qiu et al., 2020).
