The results for the control group are as follows: Reading
Comprehension Z = -4.292 (a) with p = 0.000. Given
that the Z values are negative and the p values
are less than 0.05, it can be concluded that there
are statistically significant differences between the pre-test and post-test results
in both the experimental and control groups. Consequently, the use
of graphic organizers appears to be effective in enhancing students'
reading comprehension. However, despite the significant differences observed in both
groups, it cannot be conclusively determined that the improvement in
reading comprehension is solely attributable to the use of this
strategy.
