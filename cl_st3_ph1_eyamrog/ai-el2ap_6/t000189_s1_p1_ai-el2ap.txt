OBJECTIVE: Given the rapid spread of COVID-19, the scientific community
has sought to identify factors that may influence the outcomes
of viral infections. Although there is a limited number of
studies specifically addressing the new coronavirus, it is established that
adequate serum levels of micronutrients are essential for the physiological
response to infectious diseases. Therefore, this review aims to examine
the effects of deficiencies in vitamin A, vitamin D, iron,
zinc, and folate on the prognosis of patients with respiratory
infections that present with clinical manifestations similar to those of
COVID-19, and to discuss the potential role of supplementation with
these nutrients.
