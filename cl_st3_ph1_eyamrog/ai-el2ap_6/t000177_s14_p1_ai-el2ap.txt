The transmission routes of the infectious agent require thorough assessment.
For COVID-19, current evidence indicates that two primary transmission routes
are predominant: transmission via large respiratory droplets, which are expelled
during activities such as sneezing, coughing, or talking, and transmission
via surface (fomite) contact, including hand-to-hand or hand-to-surface interactions. An
additional transmission route that has recently attracted increased scientific attention
is the fecal-oral route [14]. Table 1 presents the relationship
between aerosol droplet size and exposure time. The droplets can
