Odors from three live B. giganteus fifth-instar nymphs were collected
for analysis. Cockroach feces (20 g) were obtained from the
bottom of mass-rearing containers and were carefully separated from extraneous
materials such as dead insects, exuviae, oothecae, and food waste.
Mouse waste samples (30 g) consisted of rice hulls impregnated
with feces and urine from albino mice (strain NMRI). Each
sample was placed separately in a 500 ml glass gas-wash
bottle.
