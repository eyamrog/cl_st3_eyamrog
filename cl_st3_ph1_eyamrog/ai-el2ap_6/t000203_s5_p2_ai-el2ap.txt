A major criticism of the initial phase of this research
was that, in the analysis conducted on April 11, the
higher incidence, mortality, and lethality rates observed in countries without
an active vaccination program could be attributed to these countries
being, on average, ten days ahead in the epidemic timeline
compared to countries with an active program. To address this
potential temporal bias in the second phase, the analysis compared
data from April 11 to May 11 for countries with
active vaccination programs to data up to April 11 for
countries without such programs. This approach effectively places the active
vaccination group an average of 20 days ahead, thereby reducing
the likelihood of time-related confounding present in the previous analysis.
As shown in Tables 3, 4, and 5, even with
this temporal adjustment, countries in the active vaccination group continue
to exhibit lower incidence, mortality, and lethality rates. These findings
challenge the hypothesis that the observed differences are solely due
to temporal factors and support the conclusion that the severity
of disease impact is not maintained over time in the
same manner across groups.
