Recent proposals emphasize the importance of analyzing the structural impact
of identified categories on the timing and experience of stigma,
including both the occurrence of stigma and the anticipation of
stigmatization. Specifically, it is necessary to examine how an individual's
experience of stigma is shaped by the intersection of multiple
social categories, such as race or ethnicity, class, gender, and
age, among others (Collins, Von Unger, & Armbrister, 2008).
