The survey was administered both face-to-face and online using the
Google Forms platform, and was conducted in the university's computer
laboratories with support from members of the research team. Data
collection took place during February 2018. The intervention was implemented
in cycles, and students completed the survey in approximately 30
to 40 minutes.
