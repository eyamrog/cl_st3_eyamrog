The trend in the daily number of deaths in Brazil
exhibits a distinct pattern, as illustrated in Figure 5. Unlike
the pronounced and sustained plateau observed for São Paulo State
(Figure 1) and São Paulo City (Figure 3), the period
of stabilization in Brazil is considerably shorter, persisting for only
three to four days before the number of deaths begins
to increase again, as shown in Figure 5.
