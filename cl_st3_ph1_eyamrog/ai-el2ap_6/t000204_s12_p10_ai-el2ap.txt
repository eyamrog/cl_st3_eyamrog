Supporting these concerns, a recent study involving 775 adult residents
of the United States found that individuals who experienced functional
impairment due to fear and anxiety related to the coronavirus
reported higher levels of hopelessness, suicidal ideation, spiritual crisis, and
problems with alcohol or drug abuse compared to those who
were anxious but did not exhibit dysfunctional anxiety specifically associated
with COVID-19 (19).
