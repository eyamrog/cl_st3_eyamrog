Future designs should reevaluate the methods used to triage and
conduct initial assessments of patients presenting with symptoms indicative of
airborne viruses, with the aim of minimizing their exposure to
areas occupied by other patient groups whenever feasible. In planning
for future healthcare facilities, architects, designers, building operators, and healthcare
administrators should prioritize hospital designs that support the implementation of
enhanced social distancing measures and reduce connectivity and movement between
common areas, while also maintaining flexibility to allow for efficient
space utilization under normal operating conditions.
