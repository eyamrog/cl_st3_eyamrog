Arena 3: Triatomine responses to odorous air currents were assessed
using a glass Y-tube dual-choice olfactometer (Fig 1C). Each of
the three Belminus species was tested separately for behavioral responses
to volatiles emitted from (1) live cockroaches, (2) cockroach feces,
and (3) mouse feces. Individual triatomine bugs were introduced at
the base of the Y-olfactometer and allowed to walk upwind
along the stem (22 cm length, 2.370 cm internal diameter,
2.804 cm external diameter). Upon reaching the junction, each insect
was required to choose between the two arms of the
Y-olfactometer (each arm 13 cm in length). Orientation was quantified
by recording the arm selected by each individual. All insects
initiated movement from the base and made a definitive choice.
A preliminary spatial control using two clean arms was conducted
to assess potential asymmetries, and no significant differences were detected.
Charcoal-filtered air was drawn through the system using a pump
(stimulus controller CS-55, Syntech) at an airspeed of 10 ±
2 cm/s, as measured by a hot-wire anemometer (2440, Kurtz;
accuracy ± 0.01 m/s). One arm was connected to a
500 ml glass gas-wash bottle containing the odor source, while
the other arm was connected to an identical clean control
bottle. Both air streams converged at the Y-stem, with environmental
conditions maintained at 23 ± 2 °C and 70% relative
humidity (RH), as measured by a thermo-hygrometer (EA80, Extech Instruments;
accuracy ± 3% RH and ± 1 °C). All tubing,
fittings, and valves were constructed from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, International Polymer
Solutions Inc). Headspace volatiles were tested by placing the odor
samples in 500 ml glass gas-wash bottles, which were equilibrated
for at least 10 minutes prior to testing. A 15-minute
interval was maintained between experiments to allow for additional volatile
emission from cockroaches and waste samples. For controls, air was
passed over filter paper and rice hulls moistened with 5
ml of water for cockroach feces and mouse waste, respectively;
the control for live cockroaches consisted of a clean gas-wash
bottle with similarly moistened filter paper. Water was used to
standardize humidity levels to those produced by the organic samples
(Otálora-Luna and Guerin 2014). The airflow through each bottle was
set at 150 ml/min. Each triatomine was observed for up
to 30 minutes or until a response was recorded. The
positions of the odor and control flasks were alternated for
each insect, and the Y-olfactometer was cleaned between trials. To
further assess potential asymmetries, odorless control trials with two empty
bottles were conducted. The experimental setup was placed near an
exhaust hood capable of exchanging room air 15 times per
hour to minimize background odors. Mouse waste was not tested
with B. herreri due to insufficient numbers of naïve individuals
in the colony.
