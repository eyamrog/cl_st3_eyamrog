Figure 5 demonstrates that in a dry room environment (20ÂºC,
20% relative humidity) and in a humid room with 80%
relative humidity, the majority of coronaviruses remain viable for up
to two days (indicated by the blue line and blue
star). In contrast, in a room with air at 50%
relative humidity, less than 1% of viruses remain viable after
two days (indicated by the red star) [25].
