The heterogeneous distribution of COVID-19 across the territory corresponds with
areas of highest affluence within the state. This pattern suggests
that the most interconnected regions experienced greater increases in incidence
and mortality during the initial phase of the pandemic. Consequently,
testing rates increased in these areas, with rapid tests being
widely implemented across all regions and RT-PCR tests being prioritized
in locations with higher mortality rates.
