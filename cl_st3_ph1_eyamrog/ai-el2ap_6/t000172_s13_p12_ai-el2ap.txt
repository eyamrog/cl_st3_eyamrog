The PLpro protein (nsp3) from SARS-CoV has been shown to
significantly activate the TGF-Î²1 promoter via the ROS/p38-MAPK/STAT3 signaling pathway,
which is associated with the positive regulation of pro-fibrotic responses
both in vitro and in vivo (Li et al., 2016).
Additionally, p53 has been identified as a negative regulator of
SARS-CoV replication and is targeted by nsp3 through an E3
ubiquitin ligase-mediated mechanism (Ma-Lauer et al., 2016). Furthermore, the viral
protease 3CLpro (nsp5) has been demonstrated to specifically cleave STAT2,
but not JAK1, TYK2, STAT1, or IRF9, all of which
are key components of the JAK-STAT pathway, thereby antagonizing type
I interferon signaling (Zhu et al., 2017).
