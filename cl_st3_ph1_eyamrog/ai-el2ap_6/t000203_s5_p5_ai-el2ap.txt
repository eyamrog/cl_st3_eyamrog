This study indicates that BCG vaccination coverage may have varying
effects across different countries and may help address unresolved questions,
such as the observation of a more pronounced impact among
older adults, in whom BCG-induced immune memory is more likely
to wane. Additionally, the study highlights discrepancies in outcomes among
populations and regions with similar levels of exposure and contamination
but differing impacts, as well as the higher lethality observed
in countries with advanced healthcare systems but without BCG vaccination
coverage. To further substantiate these findings, a double-blind, randomized trial
utilizing the tuberculin skin test (PPD) as a measure of
vaccine-induced immune memory is recommended for future research.
