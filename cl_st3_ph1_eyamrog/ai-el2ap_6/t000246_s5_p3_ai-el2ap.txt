In comparison to research conducted in the field of obstetrics,
the number of studies in this area constitutes a relatively
small proportion, with 142,659 articles and 9,967 clinical trials identified
between 2002 and 2013. Nevertheless, the data indicate an exponential
increase in the number of publications, despite the inherent challenges
associated with conducting research on viruses, which include the need
for advanced methodological expertise, substantial financial resources, and significant time
investment.
