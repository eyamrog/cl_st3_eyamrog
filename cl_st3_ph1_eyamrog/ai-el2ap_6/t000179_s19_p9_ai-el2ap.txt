Measurement invariance was established across marital status (living with a
partner vs. not), presence of chronic disease (yes vs. no),
and presence of work-related disease (yes vs. no), allowing for
valid comparisons between these groups. In contrast, measurement invariance was
not supported for sex (men vs. women), employment in other
institutions, or length of employment at the institution, precluding meaningful
comparisons across these variables (see Supplement 3). Additionally, invariance could
not be assessed for type of organization, monthly income, possession
of a specialty, or participant age, as the necessary statistical
assumptions for these analyses were not met in these cases.
