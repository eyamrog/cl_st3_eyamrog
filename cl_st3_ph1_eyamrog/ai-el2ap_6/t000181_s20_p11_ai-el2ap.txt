Given that women often assume a greater share of the
responsibilities and risks associated with healthcare provider roles within the
household, frequently with minimal external support (Smith, 2019), notable gender
differences were observed in responses to the fourteenth item of
the exhaustion subscale ("I feel tired or even exhausted"). Specifically,
a higher proportion of men reported never (20.7%) or only
occasionally (26.4%) feeling tired or exhausted during the pandemic, whereas
women reported experiencing these feelings often (22.5%) or most of
the time (27.9%). Additionally, school closures appear to have a
disproportionate impact on women, who are primarily responsible for informal
caregiving within families (Smith, 2019).
