It is expected that the same institutions are actively submitting
data to multiple databases, as they host prominent research groups
specializing in emerging and infectious diseases, biodiversity, and biotechnology. However,
the majority of these institutions are located in Lima, the
capital of Peru. To enhance diversity and representativeness, it is
recommended that funding efforts be directed toward regional research groups
and the study of a broader range of taxa, including
non-pathogenic bacteria, archaea, non-vertebrates, and non-flowering plants.
