It is essential to invest in geographic intelligence to systematically
map and monitor areas of greatest vulnerability, identify all families
receiving benefits from the food program, and conduct randomized verification
of the program’s effectiveness. This process should incorporate web applications
to facilitate monitoring and enable the collection of information from
individuals who are not receiving aid. Registrations should adhere to
an active surveillance model. The implementation of this approach is
expected to generate timely and sufficient data to support government
assessment of the school feeding program’s effectiveness during the pandemic,
thereby informing necessary adjustments to better meet students’ nutritional needs.
