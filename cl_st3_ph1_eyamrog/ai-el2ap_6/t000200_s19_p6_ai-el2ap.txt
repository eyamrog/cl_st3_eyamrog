The results of the linear regression analysis indicated a positive
correlation between leptospirosis incidence rates and rainfall during the period
with the highest rainfall volume (r = 0.83). Additionally, the
coefficient of determination (RÂ²) for this period was 0.69, indicating
that 69% of the variability in disease rates could be
explained by rainfall.
