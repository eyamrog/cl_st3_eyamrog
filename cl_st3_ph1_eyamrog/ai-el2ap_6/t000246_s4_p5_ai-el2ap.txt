Lotka's Law offers a framework for quantifying author productivity patterns
within a specified time frame, with each subfield of a
discipline characterized by a distinct exponent that reflects its particular
rate of author productivity. However, this law does not account
for the underlying factors that explain why some individuals produce
a large number of publications on a given topic, while
others produce few or none.
