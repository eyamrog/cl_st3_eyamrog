Coan et al.13 reported monthly variations in rainfall rates in
Santa Catarina, with the highest values observed on the north
coast between October and March, and the lowest values on
the south coast from April to September, as well as
increased precipitation in the Vale do Rio Itaja√≠ and the
western region of the state. These findings are consistent with
the results of the present study, which identified higher rates
of leptospirosis incidence in these regions and during the same
periods.
