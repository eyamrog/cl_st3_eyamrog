In this study, a comprehensive worldwide bibliometric analysis of SARS-related
publications was conducted over a 31-year period. The extended timeframe,
combined with the thorough scope of the bibliometric investigation, enabled
the application of appropriate methods and bibliometric indices, thereby minimizing
the potential for data relativity.
