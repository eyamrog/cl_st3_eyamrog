Most disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) for multiple sclerosis (MS) require regular
clinical evaluations, laboratory testing, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to
monitor disease activity and detect potential drug-related adverse effects. Lymphopenia,
which can occur with agents such as fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate,
and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, is a significant concern due to
its association with an increased risk of infectious diseases.
