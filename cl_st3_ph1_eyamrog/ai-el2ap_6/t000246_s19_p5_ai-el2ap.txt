The collaborative analysis included only countries with at least five
publications, resulting in a total of 24 countries (36.36%) represented
on the collaborative map (Figure 3). An equal number of
countries published only a single document. Figure 3 illustrates this
distribution, showing the formation of six clusters, each indicated by
a different color. Within this group, Brazil is the sole
representative from Latin America; however, its collaborations are limited to
Italy and Germany, despite sharing a cluster with Belgium, Spain,
France, and the Netherlands. This cluster, comprising seven countries, has
produced 306 documents, accounting for 18.85% of all documents identified
in this study.
