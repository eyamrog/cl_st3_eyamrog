A journal is capable of publishing high-quality, robust scientific research
regardless of its rate of self-citation. There is no inherent
correlation between journal-level self-citation rates and the quality of research
published, particularly in high-output journals such as Zootaxa. The approach
taken by Clarivate appears to prioritize the promotion of competition
among journals, potentially to support the commercial sale of its
journal ranking data and analytics. However, the publishing and citation
practices of zoological taxonomists do not necessarily align with the
evaluative models promoted by Clarivate. It is therefore questionable whether
a profit-driven analytics company, with limited expertise in taxonomy, is
equipped to accurately assess and rank the quality of taxonomic
journals. The scientific community, with its specialized training and experience
in taxonomic research, is better positioned to evaluate the quality
and impact of work within this field.
