Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties and
have been utilized in the treatment of inflammatory conditions such
as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis (Sharma 2020). These agents disrupt
lysosomal acidification, thereby inhibiting antigen presentation, phospholipase A2 activity, Toll-like
receptors (TLRs), T and B cell receptor signaling, and the
production of cytokines including interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (Sinha
and Balayla 2020). Additionally, the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase
3 beta (GSK3Î²) by CQ may contribute to its immunomodulatory
effects in the context of COVID-19 (Embi et al. 2020).
