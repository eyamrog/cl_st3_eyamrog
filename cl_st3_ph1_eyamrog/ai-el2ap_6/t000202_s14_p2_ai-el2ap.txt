In this study, we examine various time periods to estimate
the frequency of a given habit, recognizing that frequency alone
does not necessarily indicate actual engagement in the habit, as
previously noted. In contrast, a specific cultural activity performed within
a defined period, along with its intensity—measured by the number
of occurrences or the amount of time devoted to it—is
considered a cultural practice.
