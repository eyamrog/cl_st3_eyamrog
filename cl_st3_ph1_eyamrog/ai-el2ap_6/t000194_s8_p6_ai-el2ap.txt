The first investigation into the diversity of freshwater hyphomycetes in
Brazilian insular regions was conducted by Moro et al. (2018)
in Ilhabela State Park (PEIb). On the same island, two
new species of freshwater hyphomycetes, Polylobastipora setulosa (Moro et al.
2015a) and Campylospora brasiliensis (Moro et al. 2015b), were described.
Additionally, the first record of Peyronelina glomerulata PJ Fisher, J.
Webster & DF Kane in Brazil was reported by Moro
et al. (2015c).
