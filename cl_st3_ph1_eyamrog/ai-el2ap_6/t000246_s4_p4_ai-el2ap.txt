As the classical formulation of Bradford's Law was applied, it
was anticipated that the fit would not be exact, as
multiple variables influence the empirical distribution of the literature. These
variables are not accounted for in Bradford's original formula and
present a significant challenge for contemporary researchers seeking to refine
its mathematical representation. The core identified through the application of
the Law effectively highlighted a key aspect of scientific publishing
behavior related to SARS: when certain journals are recognized or
are likely to gain recognition within the field, an increasing
number of publications are directed to them. To further assess
this phenomenon, it is important to evaluate the qualitative aspects
of these journals, with impact factor indicators serving as the
most reliable measures.
