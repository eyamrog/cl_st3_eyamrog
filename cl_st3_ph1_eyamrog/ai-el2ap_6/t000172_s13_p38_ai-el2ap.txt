Tocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the interleukin-6 receptor
(IL-6R), thereby inhibiting IL-6 signaling. Preprint studies suggest that tocilizumab
is safe and demonstrates efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19.
However, due to the limited availability of comprehensive clinical trial
data, its use is currently recommended primarily for critically ill
patients exhibiting elevated IL-6 levels (Zhang et al. 2020a). Preliminary
clinical evidence also supports the administration of repeated doses (Luo
et al. 2020). Reported concerns associated with tocilizumab include the
potential development of osteonecrosis of the jaw and acute hypertriglyceridemia
(Bennardo et al. 2020; Morrison et al. 2020).
