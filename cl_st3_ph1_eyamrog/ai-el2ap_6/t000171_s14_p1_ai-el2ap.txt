methods applied for analysis. Data analysis was performed utilizing the
Python™ programming language (version 3.7.7), specifically employing the libraries Matplotlib
(version 3.2.1), Pandas (version 1.0.5), and Statistics. All analyses were
carried out within the Project Jupyter© programming environment.
