The utilization of waste odors for resource location is a
structural adaptation commonly observed in triatomines, as the associated volatile
organic compounds are end-products of metabolic processes in the gut
flora of both vertebrates and invertebrates and therefore exhibit limited
variation among different hosts (Ot치lora-Luna and Guerin 2014). These compounds
may play a significant role in the invasion of human
dwellings by triatomines, as previously reported (Ot치lora-Luna and Guerin 2014).
Belminus species are likely to employ the same general chemical
cues used to locate wild hosts when exploiting synanthropic invertebrates,
such as cockroaches, since similar odors are present in both
invertebrates and vertebrates. This similarity in chemical cues may account
for the ability of these small triatomines to transition readily
to domestic habitats (Ot치lora-Luna and Guerin 2014; Ot치lora-Luna et al.
2016).
