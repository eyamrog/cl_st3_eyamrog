Application of Bradford's Law to analyze the distribution of journals,
as presented in Table 3, enabled identification of a constant
Bradford Multiplier (Bm), with the variation between the Bm values
across the zones remaining within the acceptable range of 0.7,
as specified by the law. This result indicates a distribution
pattern closely approximating the ideal (1:n:nÂ²) as defined by Bradford's
Law. The core, or nucleus, consisted of 15 journals, which
were identified as the most dedicated to the subject under
investigation.
