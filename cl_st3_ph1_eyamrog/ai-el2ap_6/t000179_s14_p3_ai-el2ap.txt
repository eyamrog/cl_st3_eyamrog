Participants were selected using a complex two-stage probabilistic sampling method
designed to achieve national representativeness and stratified by political region.
The primary sampling units were healthcare centers, and the secondary
sampling units were healthcare professionals. Physicians aged over 65 years,
corresponding to the retirement age in Peru, were excluded from
the study.
