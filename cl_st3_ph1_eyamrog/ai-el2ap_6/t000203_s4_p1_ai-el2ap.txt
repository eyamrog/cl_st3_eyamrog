The observed lower incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 in
countries with ongoing Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) vaccination programs are both
noteworthy and biologically plausible. To date, ongoing analyses have identified
a correlation between the extent of BCG program coverage and
the reported numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths across countries
over two consecutive months. Rapid initiation of prospective and controlled
studies is warranted, as BCG vaccination may offer a potential
interim strategy for the prevention of severe COVID-19 cases until
a disease-specific vaccine becomes available.
