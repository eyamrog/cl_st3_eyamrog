The use of graphic organizers to enhance reading comprehension represents

textbook-based activities. Based on the findings of this study, the
researchers propose a set of graphic organizers and corresponding activities
designed to assist EFL teachers and their students in systematically
organizing information encountered in texts during reading lessons.
