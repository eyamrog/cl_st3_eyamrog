Highly active multiple sclerosis (MS) patients may require a more
intensive therapeutic approach, even when this entails an increased risk
of infection during a pandemic. Patients who are older at
symptom onset (over 35 years), exhibit any pyramidal signs, and
demonstrate greater disability—defined as an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)
score of 3.0 or higher within the first year after
symptom onset—are at increased risk of developing aggressive disease. This
subgroup constitutes approximately 10% of the MS population and warrants
a highly individualized and collaborative treatment strategy. In such cases,
induction therapy may be a reasonable option.
