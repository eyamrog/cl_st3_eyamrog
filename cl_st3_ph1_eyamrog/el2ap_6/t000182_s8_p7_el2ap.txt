For many vertebrates, chemicals present in feces and urine constitute
important signals that serve to mark their territory (Young and
Henke 1999, Brennan 2001); sylvatic hosts such as opossums, armadillos
and bats, as well as synantrophic host such as chickens
dogs, cats and rodents cumulate excretory products in or near
their nesting sites. Triatomines –as ectoparasites– use emanations from such
host waste when searching for resources. Humans are not an
exception; we have captured triatomine bugs in bathrooms, latrines, sewers
and trashcans in rural and urban endemic areas (Aldana and
Otálora-Luna 2019). Otálora-Luna and Guerin (2014) found that amines present
in vertebrate waste (i.e. feces and urine) attract Rhodnius prolixus,
Triatoma infestans and Panstrongylus geniculatus. To the best of our
knowledge this is the first time host’s feces were considered
as a source of kairomones, indicating a food source for
triatomine bugs. These authors designed their experiments and addressed their
conclusions hypothesizing that triatomines are ectoparasites closely associated with their
host; normally sharing the same refuge. Given our ethological focus,
in this study we performed a selection of odor sources
based on our previous ectoparasite hypothesis (Otálora- Luna and Guerin
2014) and our previous experimental model, i.e. observation of triatomine
FAP (Páez-Rondón et al. 2018). In order to elucidate which
chemical stimuli emanating from host excretions trigger the feeding instinct
of Belminus, we assessed the orientation responses of B. corredori,
B. ferroae and B. herreri to volatiles produced by cockroaches
and host wastes, as well as rodent wastes.
