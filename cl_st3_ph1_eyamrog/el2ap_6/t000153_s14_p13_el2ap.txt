The importance of research connected to the study of how
the stigma of abortion operates in professionals lies in, as
Kumar, Hessini y Mitchell (2009) state, the fact that stigma
ought to be deemed as an element that contributes to
eliminating abortion from the repertoire of practices or services provided
by institutions, demoting it to clandestinity, creating a disincentive for
healthcare workers to take part in some part of the
trajectory or itinerary of abortion (Heilborn et al., 2012; Oâ€™Donnell,
Weitz, Freedman 2011). Consequently, what ought to be deemed as
the right to a medical practice becomes an anomaly or
an exceptional event, clouded by moral judgement.
