Although the use of JIF is not recommended for ranking
individuals (Alberts 2013), its impact in the real-life academic career
is crystal clear. It is widely perceived that an academic
researcher can only evolve in his/her career by means of
publishing in journals with high JIF values. The metric has
well-known limitations when used to evaluate both journals or individual
papers, because the index is strongly sensible to what is
considered a citable item (The PLoS Medicine Editors 2006); also,
it is characterized by a misuse of statistics such as
media and median (Vanclay 2012) and may be radically influenced
by a single or few papers (e.g., Dimitrov 2010). Its
widespread adoption leads to several distortions such as unjustified multi-
authored papers and schemes by journals to artificially increase JIF
or impact inflation; these schemes are among the most common
outcomes of the JIF mania. Because of the metrics inflation,
the bibliometric platforms act as judges to prevent these types
of distortion, excluding or punishing “deviant” journals. Indexing platforms such
as Clarivate/JCR, for instance, adopt no less than 24 criteria
into a putatively unreproducible method of analysis. When a journal
disagrees or does not fulfill one of these criteria, it
is suppressed (Clarivate 2020a). The lack of transparency greatly affects
our ability to properly evaluate journal suppressions. The philosophical dilemma
“Who watches the watchmen?”, eternalized in the famous graphic novel
Watchmen, written by Alan Moore, fits well here.
