Open windows in toilets with passive stack or mechanical exhaust
systems may cause contaminated airflow from the toilet to other
rooms. So, in these circumstances, it is recommended that toilet
windows remain shut. If there is no adequate exhaust ventilation
from toilets, and window airflow cannot be avoided, keep windows
open in other spaces to achieve cross flows through buildings.
