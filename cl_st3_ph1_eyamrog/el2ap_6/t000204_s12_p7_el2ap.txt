The most significant areas of activation during social anxiet disorder
are the following: bilateral amygdaloid complex, the left medial temporal
lobe encompassing the entorhinal cortex, the left medial aspect of
the inferior temporal lobe encompassing perirhinal cortex and the parahippocampal
gyrus, the right anterior cingulate cortex in human beings, according
to Hattingh et al. (13). The amygdalid complex, the entorhinal
cortex, the cingulum gyrus and the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus
are connected to the limbic system the main encephalic system
related to the organisation of emotions in human beings and
in other mammals. Additionally, the right brain hemisphere specific thinning
was found in the frontal, temporal, parietal and insular cortices
of individuals with social anxiety disorder (14).
