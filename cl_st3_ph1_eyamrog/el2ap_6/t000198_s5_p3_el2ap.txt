After the end of the spring term (which runs from
January through April), the summer term (April-July) continued to offer
classes online, and preparations were made for offering clinical experiences
to the students who are in the treatment care phase
of their training. The combinations of recorded clinical procedures and
more in-depth discussions of clinical scenarios were offered to provide
some experience to the students while all waited for authorization
from the state regarding restabilising clinical activities. The physical layout
of the dental clinics and pre-clinical laboratories were changed to
minimize risks of COVID-19 allowing for students to be at
a safe distance from others while working. The plan is
for resuming these activities within a month.
