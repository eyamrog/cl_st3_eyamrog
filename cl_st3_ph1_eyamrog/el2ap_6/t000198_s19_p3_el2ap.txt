The response to the pandemic came slow, but when it
happened, colleges and universities in the United States suspended classes
for a week. Learning activities were shifted to virtual teaching
in the followed week, using a combination of lecture recordings
and live sections with faculty and students connected at the
same time. At the School of Dental Medicine, all research
activities were suspended (except for the projects that could be
considered essential for the COVID-19 effort) or, otherwise, could not
be interrupted because of the employment of unique materials or
supplies. Services such as administrative meetings were moved to be
100% on-line. All elective patients care was postponed protecting staff
and preserving PPE and patient care supplies. Urgent dental cases
were discussed via teledentistry consultation until national guidelines were available
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [18]. These
cases were seen within weeks when protocols for urgent care
were nationally released (Table 1).
