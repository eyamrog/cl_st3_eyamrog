It is noted, some items of our scales (professional activity,
health center management, individual and structural working conditions) are theoretically
similar to other psychometric scales reported in the past. For
example, the 4CornerSAT questionnaire used to measure physiciansÂ´ career satisfaction
has four dimensions that are akin to the ones we
have identified in this study (personal, professional, performance, and inherent)
(41, 42).
