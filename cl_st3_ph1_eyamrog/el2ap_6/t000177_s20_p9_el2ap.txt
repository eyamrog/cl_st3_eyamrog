Even Datacenter rooms are already accepting adiabatic systems much of
the time, achieving energy savings by the use of indexes
like EUED (Energy Usage Effectiveness Design) and TWI (Total Water
Impact), where the slightly higher humidity (45%-65%) can facilitate the
use of an adiabatic system, in addition to allowing higher
temperatures for the entry of chilled water into air conditioners,
generating better compression ratios and energy savings [40-41].
