The question of the scale, measuring the attention Deficit factor,
showed significant differences between genders: men’s scores were lower as
they never (20.9%) or occasionally (29.8%) found it hard to
concentrate during the social isolation, whereas women’s answers were often
(19.9%) and most of the time (24.8%). These results could
be associated with the higher levels of exhaustion showed by
women during the pandemic and the cognitive differences between genders
(Regitz-Zagrosek, 2012).
