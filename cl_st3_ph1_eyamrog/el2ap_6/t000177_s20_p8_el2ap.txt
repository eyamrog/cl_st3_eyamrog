ASHRAE 55 defines the standards of comfort parameters, the PMV
(Predicted Mean Vote) index takes into account the relative humidity,
although at a small extend. Thus, the statement that rises
from this spreading of viruses, is that air conditioning should
no longer be thought for comfort of human, but for
comfort for the human, that is, the relative humidity must
have a weight as important as the operating temperature. Rethinking
a higher air speed even in buildings whose objective is
only human comfort, mainly with the return of the air
down, can help to change the trajectory of the virus
and inject the same in return grids with UV-C lamps
[39].
