These reports have allowed us to show how it is
possible to resist the effects of stigmatization by taking an
active role in relation to professional identity. This gets to
be translated in the increase of possibilities for women and
girls to be accompanied by a professional from the Network
in their access to a non-punishable abortion in a public
institution. Such active role has also permitted the provision of
pre and post abortion counselling sessions in many healthcare centers
across the country.
