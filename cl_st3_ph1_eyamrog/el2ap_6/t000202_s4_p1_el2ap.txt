The student body of the National University of Education of
Ecuador owns a very high technological equipment, led by the
cell phone and followed by the internet and laptop. This
ownership (acquisition) of the new technological devices seems not to
be conditioned by the individual and family socioeconomic situations, since
82% of the university students are assigned to the most
precarious social segments in family income (56% in quintile 1
and 26% in quintile 2). The new technological devices are
the main information and communication tools of UNAE students and
a common feature is the high number of hours devoted
to the use of videos, internet, cellular and television, both
daily and weekly. Likewise, there is a general balanced tendency
among genders, as well as an almost proportional distribution in
the use of these devices for academic tasks as well
as social networks.
