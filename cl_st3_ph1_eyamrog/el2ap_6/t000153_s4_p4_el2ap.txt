This article also shows the need to work on research
aimed at analyzing the results obtained by the local alliance
established between feminist organizations and other grassroots organizations and health
care providers committed to sexual and reproductive rights. The creation
of a network was the result of an initiative undertaken
by feminist activists who had already started to work with
health professionals, convinced that it was necessary to include them
as part of the work done for the immediate change
of the conditions surrounding the provision of non-punishable abortions. Sectors
of the local activism even understand that social legitimacy in
the demand for legal abortion will not be achieved by
leaving health professionals out. While the creation of coalitions does
not solve the problem of clandestine abortion in the country,
they still constitute a gradual process of change unfolding in
womenâ€™s concrete reality. These coalitions also help promote the cultural
change connected to the practice of abortion.
