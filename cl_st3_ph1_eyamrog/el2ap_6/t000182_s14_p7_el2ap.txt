To analyze behavioral details of Arenas 1-3, frontal and top
views of the experimental arenas were filmed full-screen using a
video CMOS camera (EOS Rebel T7i, Canon) equipped with a
zoom lens (EF-S 15-55 mm f, IS, Canon) coupled to
a macro lens (close-up +10, 58 mm, Commander) to obtain
a field view of 40 mm (in the diagonal) –a
pivoting base allowed to visually cover the entire arena. Experiments
were conducted in a darkened room. The source of light
for arenas 1 and 2 consisted of a LED lamp
(2850K, 570 lumens, Reveal, General Electric). The source of light
for arena 3 consisted of a LED infrared lamp (840
nm, Cmvision) –the infrared sensitivity of the camera allowed to
observe the experiments in the dark. Recordings were analyzed by
a computer video software (version 9.1.2.7, Wondershare Filmora9) for playback,
tracking and editing. The ethological language used to describe triatomine
behaviors followed suggestions of Kogon (1941) and Crist (1998).
