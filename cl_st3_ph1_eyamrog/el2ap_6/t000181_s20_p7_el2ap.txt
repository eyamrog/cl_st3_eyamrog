Results indicated that female gender was associated with increased anxiety,
depression, and stress. This finding is in line with the
results of previous studies that have consistently found an association
between female gender and increased psychological distress (Olagoke, Olagoke &
Hughes, 2020; Maza et al, 2020; Wang et al, 2020;
Qio et al, 2020). In this regard, the “Mental Health
in the UK and COVID-19” report indicated that increased depression,
anxiety, and stress were associated with being younger and female
during the pandemic (Jia, Ayling, Chalder, Massey, Broadbent, Coupland &
Vedhara, 2020).
