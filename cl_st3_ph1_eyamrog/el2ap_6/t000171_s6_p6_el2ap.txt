The same negative correlation - with different coefficients and of
greater intensity - was observed when the geographic level used
was the health macro-region. This more pronounced effect seems to
indicate that SARS-CoV-2 tends to be concentrated for a longer
time in the sub-region where it was first inserted, that
is, interregional spread is subsequent to the spread in the
locality itself. In fact, in Brazil, the virus seems to
spread through the territory in two ways: spatial, when the
virus leaves the metropolitan region for the rest of the
territory; and hierarchical, located in sub-regions in which cities of
regional importance allow the spread of COVID-19 to other locations
at a lower hierarchical level (19).
