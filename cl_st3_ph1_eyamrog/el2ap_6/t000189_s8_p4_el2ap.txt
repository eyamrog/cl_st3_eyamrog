Considering the lack of scientific evidence regarding the role of
nutritional deficiencies in the prognosis of viral infections and, given
the current global pandemic scenario of COVID-19, the present study
aimed to assess, based on the literature, the effects of
deficiency of vitamin A, D, iron, zinc or folate in
the prognosis of patients with respiratory infections with manifestations similar
to COVID-19 and discuss about supplementation of the nutrients included
for qualitative analysis in this review.
