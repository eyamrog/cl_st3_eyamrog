Stakeholders of RBMFC, a medical specialty journal in Brazil, were
generally as supportive to open peer review as participants of
a large-scale survey with an over- representation of researchers from
the Global North and the natural sciences. This suggests the
results of the previous survey are generalizable to other settings
and encourages replication in the arts, humanities, and social sciences,
which were underrepresented in the previous survey and not included
in the present one.
