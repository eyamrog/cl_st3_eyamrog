Cockroach odors emanated from three living B. giganteus 5th nymphs.
Cockroach feces were collected (20 g) and separated from extraneous
material (e.g., dead insects, exuviae, oothecae and food waste) from
the bottom of the containers used for mass-rearing of B.
giganteus. Mouse wastes (30 g) consisted of rice hulls impregnated
with feces and urine of these rodents (albino mice, strain
NMRI). All samples were placed separately in 500 ml glass
gas-wash bottles.
