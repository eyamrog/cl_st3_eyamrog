After the intervention, the experimental group showed a significant improvement
in their scores (7.06). This clearly shows that using graphic
organizers helped students in their reading comprehension tasks, turning them
into more effective readers. Reading comprehension needs to be developed
through the analysis and synthesis of information, and visual help
provided by graphic organizers is definitely important in that process
too. (Pearson & Fielding, 1991). From the educational point of
view, there are some approaches and cognitive processes that support
the use of graphic organizers, especially those related to BloomÂ´s
taxonomy. When these tools are to be used, it must
be remembered how they are linked to the different stages
or levels of thinking.
