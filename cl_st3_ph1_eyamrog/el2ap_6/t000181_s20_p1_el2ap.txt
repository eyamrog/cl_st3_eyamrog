We first assessed the characteristics of the participants (gender, age,
marital status, number of children, education level, job status, and
social isolation levels during Covid-19 pandemic) as shown in Table
1. Out of the sample, 643 participants (34.9%) declared chronic
disease prevalence, standing out suffering, or psychological disorder indicators (16.1%).
This is relevant because the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak not only
hurts physically but also psychologically as it disrupts lives, causes
public panic, mental health distress (Bao, Sun, Meng, Shi &
Lu, 2020), pathological anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and depression (Veer, Riepenhausen,
Zerban, Wackerhagen, Engen, Puhlmann, ... & Mor, 2020).
