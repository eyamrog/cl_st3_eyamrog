A systematic review identified that, between 2000 and 2017, 61
studies evaluating job satisfaction in physicians had been carried out
in Europe, in which 26 different instruments were used to
assess it (38). Moreover, 31% of the studies included developed
their own instruments to assess job satisfaction (38). The great
heterogeneity of instruments used in the European context could be
related to differences in how these healthcare systems are organized
and function, so that using a single instrument could lead
to biased conclusions. In Latin America there is no data
reporting which are the most frequent instruments used to assess
job satisfaction. However, some studies conducted in this region have
adapted a variety of instruments to assess it like the
Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (39) or the Warr–Cook–Wall Job Satisfaction Scale
(40). These studies were conducted on small samples, they were
not nationally representative, and they selected instruments that were originally
designed in very different healthcare contexts in countries located in
the European region. Although there are some instruments designed in
Latin American countries, they experience the same limitations of the
European ones.
