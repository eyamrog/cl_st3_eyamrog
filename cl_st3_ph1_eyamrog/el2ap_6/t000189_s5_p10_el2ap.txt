According to a case-control study conducted by Mamani et al
(2017) [35] with 149 adults diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia, the
risk of pneumonia among individuals with deficient levels of vitamin
D (<10ng/mL) was 3.69-fold (95%CI: 1.46;9.31) greater than those with
sufficient levels (>20ng/mL) (p<0.01).
