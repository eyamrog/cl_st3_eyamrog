Such ambushing, grasping, dragging, apprehension, paralyzing and similar murderous behaviors
were not observed in Belminus bugs. The paralyzing (lethal) effect
elicited by assassin bugs differs from the sedation effect caused
by Belminus, as the latter do not pursue to kill
but to ectoparasite. Triatomines have adapted to live together with
their hosts. It should be stressed that cockroaches eventually recover
from lethargy after being sucked, and shall survive for upcoming
bites. Thus, Belminus species are not predators like the rest
of reduviids. Belminus are not assassin bugs. As with other
triatomine species, Belminus are not real hunters but thieves, i.e.,
ectoparasites that take advantage of the least carelessness of the
host to steal its fluids.
