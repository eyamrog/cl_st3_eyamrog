Monitoring strategies need to be effective and family health agents
could assist the government, using means similar to telemedicine, based
on information provided by competent departments. Therefore, to contribute to
the transparency of the use of public resources, it is
necessary to develop research on the conditions throughout the Brazilian
regions, and also to use of geographic intelligence tools that
allow spatial monitoring, linked to active surveillance mechanisms, within the
concept of participatory control of public funds, using information collection
platforms to: know if the distribution of this benefits to
families is effective and if children are receiving the food
referred to in the Law and the PNAE; know what
food is consumed by children and young people during this
period and the number of meals eaten daily by them,
with the help of family health agents; subsidize the government
with information necessary to outline strategies for monitoring and following
the diet of these children and adolescents during the pandemic.
