Several studies7,22-24 which present the temporal trend of leptospirosis and
rainfall rates confirm results of the present research. Results from
GuimarÃ£es et al.7, in addition to corroborating the association between
rainfall and disease, emphasize that the relative risk for the
occurrence of leptospirosis, in comparison with the period of higher
rainfall (November to March), presented more than twice the risk
(RR > 2.0; p < 0.01), in relation to the
month of lowest rainfall (August), and point to a causal
relationship upon comparing incidences in two different periods. These results
are in line with the present study, showing a RR
of more than three times (RR > 3.0; p <
0.01) in the incidence of leptospirosis, when comparing the period
from December to March with the month of August.
