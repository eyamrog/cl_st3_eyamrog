Figure 3 shows the evolution of the number of deaths
per day for São Paulo City. The steep rise until
April 5th climbs at a rate of 3.1 deaths per
day. Like what was seen regarding the behavior for the
state’s population, there is a flattening of cases after April
5th. However, the increase in the number of cases after
April 19th is not as visible in this case.
