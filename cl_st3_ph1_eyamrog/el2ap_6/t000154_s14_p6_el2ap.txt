The survey was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of
Universidade Vila Velha (CAAE nº 28912719.0.0000.5064, report nº 3.846.811). Participants
had to provide informed consent before proceeding to the questionnaire
items. The information provided to prospective participants included the study
objectives in neutral terms (“We would like to hear the
opinion of readers, authors and reviewers of RBMFC and members
of SBMFC about some ways RBMFC might conduct peer review
differently”) to avoid biasing the sample to a more positive
or negative attitude to the current system or open peer
review. Participants were also informed about the survey’s anonymity, expected
duration (“only 15 minutes”, which also doubled as informing about
harms or risks), benefits (“Results will inform the editorial policies
of RBMFC and other scholarly journals in general”), authorship, ethical
approval, and means of contact. Participating in the survey was
completely voluntary, that is, it was not a requirement for
people to continue interacting with RBMFC or SBMFC in any
way, and no direct incentives were offered to prospective study
participants. Because of the strict anonymity of the survey, there
was no way to prevent people from participating multiple times.
