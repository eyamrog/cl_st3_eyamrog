Páez-Rondón et al. (2018) exposed R. prolixus, T. infestans and
P. geniculatus to a drop of water, a plastic dummy
and a piece of guava fruit, and discovered that all
of these objects elicit the FAP associated with feeding. In
this study, we report for the first time such behavioral
pattern in Belminus –from an ethological point of view– which
reveals the novelty of our work.
