The highest rates were found for the Northeast and the
Far West regions, and the lowest for Serra Catarinense and
XanxerÃª. Results of the linear regression according to the Health
Region and seasonal period, for the period with higher rainfall
levels, show a monthly increase in the rates of leptospirosis
for all regions ranging from 20 to 100%. On the
other hand, lower high rates along with the significant variations
in correlation averages, as it is the case of the
Midwest and Serra Catarinense Health Regions, suggest more abrupt periods
of increased rainfall, accompanied by a significant increase of leptospirosis
cases in shorter periods. These results contrast with quite different
and irregular occurrences, upon observing the results for the seasonal
period with the lowest rainfall levels, with lower rates of
disease and with a large number of regions showing negative
monthly percentage variations.
