If the patient stops taking a DMD during COVID-19 infection,
its reintroduction should be carefully planned according to MS/NMOSD activity,
patient's age, and previously used drugs. Moreover, COVID-19 infection severity
should be observed since it is related to viremia length.
The literature has reported that after 10 days of symptom
onset, 90% of previously positive nasopharyngeal RT-PCR in mild infections
became negative, while the more severe ones remained positive72. In
addition, immunosuppression may prolong the viremic period even further. At
the same time, delaying the reintroduction of DMDs may increase
the chance of relapses or even rebound (in case of
prior natalizumab or fingolimod use). Hence, we recommend reintroducing DMDs
4 to 8 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection and encourage neurologists
to consult with infectious disease specialists aiming to confirm viral
clearance for prompt immunosuppression.
