Humidification is suggested in winter (up to a level of
30%) because nasal systems and mucous membranes are more susceptible
to infections at very low relative humidity (RH) of 10-20%.
However, from March, climatic conditions start to have a RH
higher than 30% in all European climates, without humidification.
