Protein synthesis pathways are often modulated by viruses. The activation
of the PKR pathway by RNA viruses is an important
cellular defense mechanism, which is in several cases counteracted by
viruses, including coronaviruses. Dengue virus for example sustains activation of
the cap-dependent machinery at early stages of infection, switching the
protein synthesis to a cap-independent process in the late stages
by downregulation of p70-S6K, 4E-BP1 and eIF4 factors (Villas-Bôas et
al. 2009). The SARS-CoV ORF3a is known to cause endoplasmic
reticulum stress and activation of eIF2α (eukaryotic initiation factor 2
alpha) and PERK, affecting innate immunity by suppression of type
1 IFN signaling (Minakshi et al. 2009). PKR and PERK,
which promote phosphorylation of EIF2a that may suppress host translation,
are expressed at high levels during SARS- CoV replication, although
knockdown of PKR does not affect viral replication, suggesting that
SARS-CoV possesses a mechanism to overcome the inhibitory effects of
phosphorylated eIF2α on viral mRNA translation (Krähling et al. 2009).
On the other hand, another study has shown that depletion
of the antiviral PKR pathway enhanced virus replication, increasing SARS-CoV
protein expression and virus production (de Wilde et al. 2015).
