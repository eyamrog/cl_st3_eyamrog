Dimethyl fumarate-related persistent lymphopenia (lower than 500 lymphocytes for more
than 6 months) has been associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
(PML). As the original trials used an 800 lymphocyte-count as
the cut-off point for significant lymphopenia and we are concerned
with the risk of severe respiratory infections in addition to
PML, we have adopted this cut-off point for reevaluating the
DMD choice40. We suggest the same monitoring interval and telemedicine
follow-up, as adopted for fingolimod and teriflunomide.
