Multiple models of the CFA measurement invariance were evaluated through
groups defined by relevant variables (sex, age group, marital status,
if they have a medical specialty, if they work in
other institution, individual income per month, self-reported work-related illness and
self-reported chronic disease). Thus, four measurement models with progressive restrictions
were compared between categories of these groups (e.g. between females
and males) (28, 29). Change in the CFI (ΔCFI) was
used as the main criterion for comparing models with more
restrictions against models with fewer restrictions. Simulation evidence suggests that
ΔCFI <.01 between successively more restricted models provides evidence for
measurement invariance (29). Models first assumed configural invariance (i.e. similar
factor structure across groups) as the baseline model, progressing then
to metric invariance (i.e. similar factor loadings and factor structure
across groups), strong invariance (i.e. similar thresholds, factor loadings and
factor structure across groups), and strict invariance (i.e. similar residual
item variances, thresholds, factor loadings and factor structure across groups).
The ΔCFI was examined between each model to establish if
the more restricted model was appropriate than the previous less
restricted one. We preferred ΔCFI over χ2 comparisons, since it
is not sensitive to big sample sizes (28, 29).
