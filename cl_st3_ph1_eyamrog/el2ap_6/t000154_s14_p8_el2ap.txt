The questionnaire was adapted from Ross-Hellauer et al. (2017) to
the study context and translated to Portuguese and Spanish by
the authors of this survey. Because the questionnaire defines its
key terms (traditional peer review and each trait of open
peer review) and had already been pilot tested and administered
by Ross-Hellauer et al. (2017), we opted for pilot testing
only the questionnaire translation and functionality, by reading and filling
it in ourselves as well as asking a few colleagues
to do so.
