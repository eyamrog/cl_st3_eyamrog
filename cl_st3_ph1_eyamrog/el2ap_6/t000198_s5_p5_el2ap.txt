We are probably one of the first dental schools in
the world to have started to have clinical activities with
students. This was a staged approach, with Professional Dentists beginning
on 25 May, PG students on 1 June, and UG
students on 8 June. The reception area was redesigned, reduced
to 1/3 of its capacity ensuring social distancing. A pre-entry
checkpoint was created for all patients, staff and students before
entering the clinic (temperature check, travel and COVID-19 history, hand
sanitiser and band wrist identification). PPE has been reinforced, with
the use of scrubs covered with disposable gowns, goggles, head
nets and masks used at all times (N95 available). All
patients and staff had to do a mouth wash (hydrogen
peroxide) before treatment, and the use of rubber dam and
high-volume suction were reinforced. The school started on ADA level
2; however, we are moving to level 1 from 15
June, following the same staged approach [19]. We are happy
to report that so far, the clinical operation is working
well, patients are pleased to be back and appreciative of
the extra precautions implemented, and staff and students feel safe
and engaged to be back on campus.
