Tables 3, 4, and 5 present the descriptive measures for
acceleration/inhabitants in the interest groups, as well as the result
of the interest groups comparison test. Table 4 shows the
results of the comparison between groups 2.1 and 2.2. It
can be observed that there is evidence of a statistical
difference between accelerations in the last 30 days for both
cases (p = 0.008) and deaths (p = 0.001). Group
2.1 has mean and median acceleration values higher than group
2.2. On the other hand, when comparing the acceleration up
to April 11 in group 2.1 with the acceleration up
to May 11 in group 2.2, it is observed that
there is no evidence of a difference between the accelerations
of cases (p = 0.284). However, there is evidence of
the difference between the accelerations of deaths (p = 0.001),
with the acceleration being higher in group 2.1.
