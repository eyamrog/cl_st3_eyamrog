MS and NMOSD require continuous preventive treatment to avert disability
and improve quality of life. There is no cure for
MS or NMOSD, but the long-term prognosis for patients with
both diseases improved considerably over the last decade. This situation
is mainly thanks to the emergence of a highly active
immunotherapeutic approach. This treatment strategy includes drugs, known as disease-modifying
drugs (DMDs), that interfere with the immune system through modulating
or suppressive mechanisms, which may tamper with the organismâ€™s normal
response to infections. The follow-up of patients with demyelinating disorders
is complex and involves regular appointments for clinical assessment, routine
CNS imaging, and laboratory monitoring, which can be perilous during
a pandemic.
