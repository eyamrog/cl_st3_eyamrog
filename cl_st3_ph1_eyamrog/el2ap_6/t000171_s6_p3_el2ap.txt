Adda J (2016) (13) states that the spread of influenza
viruses in the twentieth century is accompanied with human flows,
since there was a strong association between the spread of
COVID-19 in the territory and different factors, such as economic
activity and availability of transport, especially those from long distance.
This phenomenon was corroborated by Candido D et al. (2020)
(16), in a study that confirmed a greater spread of
the disease associated with the increase in distances traveled by
air. Due to the similarity in transmission, it is expected
that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus occurs in the same
way. In fact, Jia et al. (2020) (15) demonstrated, for
the Chinese territory, the close association related to the flows
of people between the territories and the disease incidence rates.
Furthermore, the authors established a relationship between gross domestic product
(GDP) and the population size, which loses predictive value over
time, hence suggesting migration of the virus to economically diverse
and less affluent regions.
