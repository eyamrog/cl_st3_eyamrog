In total, the questionnaire had five pages. After a landing
page for language selection (Portuguese, Spanish, English) and another page
for informed consent, two main pages comprised 45 items, and
a fifth and last page thanked participants and provided the
URL where the results would eventually be made available at
https://osf.io/u9p4n/. The first main page comprised 18 items: seven items
about participant characteristics (age, gender, schooling, geographic region, stakeholder groups,
satisfaction with peer review in RBMFC, personal experience with peer
review), seven items about the opinion on whether each trait
would improve peer review, and four items about agreement on
scholarly communication currently working well and the desirability of three
open science aspects (open access, open data, and open peer
review) being common practice. The second main page comprised 27
items: three items about the experience as author and/or reviewer
with open identities, open reports, and open participation; and 24
items about the agreement with statements about the seven traits
of open peer review. Items about satisfaction, desirability (“…should be
common practice”) and agreement had an ordinal scale with five
levels, plus a sixth “don’t know”. All items (except stakeholder
group) had to be filled before proceeding to the next
page, and participants were not allowed to revise their answers
before submitting them. The questionnaire items were not randomized in
any way, and the only adaptive aspect of the survey
was the language selection.
