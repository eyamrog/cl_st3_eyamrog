Satisfaction scale on general professional activity KMO value was greater
than 0.90, suggesting an adequate sample size to perform the
exploratory factor analysis. Parallel analysis identified two possible dimensions and
Kaiser's analysis identified a single dimension. Due to this heterogeneity
in our findings, one and two-dimensions models were evaluated at
this stage. The one-dimensional model showed adequate factor loads (Î»>0.4;
see Table 2), but the two-dimension model did not meet
the criteria of having at least three items for each
dimension. Therefore, this two- dimension model was not considered for
additional analyses.
