Pathogen dissemination through the air occurs through droplets and aerosols
typically generated by coughing, sneezing, shouting, breathing, toilet flushing, and
some medical procedures. Ventilation systems cannot interrupt the rapid settling
of large droplets and they can influence the transmission of
droplet nuclei infectious aerosols. Directional airflow can create clean-to-dirty flow
patterns and move infectious aerosols to be exhausted [12, 13].
