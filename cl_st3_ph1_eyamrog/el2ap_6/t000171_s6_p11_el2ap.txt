The heterogeneous distribution of COVID-19 across the territory overlaps the
areas with the highest affluence in the state. This may
indicate that the most interconnected regions are those with a
greater increase in incidence and mortality in the first moments
of the pandemic, which would cause the testing rate to
increase in parallel, with privilege for rapid tests in all
regions and RT-PCR tests where there is a higher mortality
rate.
