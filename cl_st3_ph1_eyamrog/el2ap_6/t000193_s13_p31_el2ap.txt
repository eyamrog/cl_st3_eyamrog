In addition, we recommend annual CNS imaging (MRI) to be
checked via telemedicine for almost all stable MS patients. Natalizumab-treated
patients with double or triple PML risk (combination of 2–3
of the following: previous immunosuppression, JCV index >0.9, or >24
infusions) are the exception to this recommendation. These patients require
MRI monitoring for asymptomatic PML screening every 3–6 months.
