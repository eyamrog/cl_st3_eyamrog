The clinical progression of COVID-19 indicates that the initial symptoms
are due to increased viral load and, in the following
weeks of infection, seroconversion of IgG reduces viral load at
the same time that some patients present worsening of the
symptoms related to immunopathological damage (Peiris et al. 2003). Convalescent
plasma (CP) has been used for SARS, MERS, Ebola virus
and Chikungunya virus disease to improve survival rate (Alzoughool and
Alanagreh 2020). Different groups have tested critically ill COVID-19 patients
with CP and obtained good recovery with no severe adverse
effects (Duan et al. 2020; Shi et al. 2020; Zhang
et al. 2020b). FDA has approved CP to treat critical
patients (Tanne 2020), although it has the risk of aggravating
hyperimmune response, presenting a better response if administered in the
early onset of the disease (Zhao and He 2020). Key
points to the use of CP are: establishing eligibility criteria
of donor COVID-19 convalescent patients, pre-screening tests of the donors,
criteria for CP collection, and treatment of plasma (Epstein and
Burnouf 2020). Currently, CP is being tested in 212 clinical
trials worldwide against COVID-19 (Cochrane COVID-19 Study register).
