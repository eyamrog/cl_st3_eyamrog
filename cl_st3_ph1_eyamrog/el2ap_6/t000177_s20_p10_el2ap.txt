Furthermore, future designs should reconsider the best way to triage
and complete initial assessment of patients that present symptoms related
to airborne viruses to minimize exposure to areas with other
patient types if possible. In planning for the future, architects,
designers, building operators, and health care administrators should aspire for
hospital designs that can accommodate periods of enhanced social distancing
and minimize connections and flow between common areas, while also
affording flexibility for efficient use of space during normal operating
conditions.
