Because SARS-CoV-2 is not yet fully known, emotions such as
fear and anxiety are usually conceived. Therefore, during this critical
scenario within society, the validation of knowledge is fundamental for
the creation of better methodologies, strategies and tactics for teaching-learning.
In other words, the relationship between educators and learners, with
ethical and humanitarian commitment, must permeate values of scientific thought.
Education is, therefore, a central space in decision making while
facing COVID-19. In this regard, we emphasise the need for
a multidisciplinary development, involving the synergy between neurosciences and education.
