In Peruvian health system, National Health Authority (SUSALUD) is responsible
of protect and promote the health rights based on insurance
and health care provision. Within this competence, physicianâ€™s job satisfaction
was become relevant, yet little has been done to measure
it. This study provides novel evidence of the validity and
reliability of the ENSUSALUD satisfaction scales to measure job satisfaction
among physicians. Having national measures of work satisfaction and other
work variables in health professionals represent a valuable tool for
decision-makers. In particular, the ENSUSALUD allowed us to have a
vision of several important organizational elements in Peruvian primary care
physicians. Our results could contribute to a better measurement of
physician satisfaction in Peru, and it serves as basis for
making-decisions public policies in the human resources in health area,
as well as serve as source for developing their applicability
to Spanish-speaking physicians in other health systems in Latin America
and Europe.
