We are aware of the leading role that bibliometric indexes
play in the science publishing industry, as well as their
considerable influence on how and where science is done nowadays.
However, JIF cannot determine the development of a whole scientific
field, even when supporting agencies adopt it as a criterion
of quality. A high JIF does not necessarily come from
a high-quality taxonomic study; it is probably much more connected
to the scope and diversity of methods and sources of
data that are aligned to high JIF ranked journals. Another
aspect to be considered is that Zootaxa was focused initially
on long papers on descriptive taxonomy; subsequently, it gradually changed
its scope and started accepting short notes and studies on
various subjects associated to zoological taxonomy/systematics. Curiously, soon after Clarivate
announced the reinstatement of the JIF of Zootaxa for next
September (Clarivate 2020b), the journalâ€™s website refreshed its JIF, showing
perhaps that it is willingly taking part in the JIF
games.
