In the article, "Mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic
on food and nutrition of schoolchildren," UNESCO mentions the transfer
of money to families affected by the closure of educational
institutions, via the card normally used to acquire school supplies.
According to this article, the amount of the transfer varies
according to the daily number of meals that children usually
receive in schools [11].
