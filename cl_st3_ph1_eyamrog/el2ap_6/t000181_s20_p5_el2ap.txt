Furthermore, since health services availability, governance structures, and emergency responders
interactions, all have gender dimensions (Smith, 2019) and considering that
gender roles and stigma affect adherence to counseling and treatment
(Rugema et al, 2019) it is possible to infer that
women could be of utmost importance to control the spread
of the coronavirus infection, and consequently, improving global health security
(Wenham, Smith & Morgan, 2020). In that sense, it is
of utmost importance to include women’s voices and knowledge in
decision making, preparedness, and response to the pandemic, as there
is an insufficient women’s representation in global Covid-19 policy spaces
(Wenham, 2020).
