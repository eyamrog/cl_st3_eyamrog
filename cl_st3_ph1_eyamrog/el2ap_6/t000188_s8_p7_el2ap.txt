When the growth of an event is exponential, the uncertainties
also grow exponentially, as is the case with the COVID-19
pandemic. Several mathematical models built from the knowledge and data
available can simulate different scenarios and identify trends. Even considering
the possibility of a certain level of uncertainty, like any
scientific result, the discoveries made from mathematical models are considered
of paramount importance for the planning of public policies.7 A
simpler model in terms of understanding and application, which has
already been used in studies carried out in China, is
Boltzmann's model.8-10 Thus, the objective of this study was to
estimate the total potential number of deaths by COVID-19 for
Brazil in the next two months, using Boltzmann's function -
based on regression analysis.
