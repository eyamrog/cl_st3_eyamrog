We are going through challenging times for healthcare systems worldwide.
Due to global challenges in demographic, political, economic and social
dimensions of human life, the healthcare field is experiencing unprecedented
changes that threaten the ability of many organizations to effectively
promote and protect population health. Many of these healthcare systems
struggle to survive, too. To successfully navigate these challenges, healthcare
systems need committed and productive teams, including physicians working in
collaboration with organization leaders and the community (44). Job satisfaction
is a relevant dimension to monitor over time, but most
measurement scales available nowadays are outdated, limited or not culturally
translated to other countries and highly diverse territories. In order
to support the existence and protective capacity of healthcare systems
to promote and maintain population health and wellbeing, job satisfaction
needs to be adequately addressed.
