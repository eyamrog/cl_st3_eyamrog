Every middle of year giant companies on scientific data analytics,
the American-British Clarivate™ (InCites™) and the Dutch RELX™ Elsevier B.V.
(Scopus®), release their metrics for scientific journals indexed in their
huge databases, among them the Journal Impact Factor™ (JIF) and
the CiteScore™, respectively. These metrics have been adopted as major
qualifiers by several countries as a single measure of the
quality of the produced research in their universities and institutes.
Generally, funding for research in these institutions is derived from
the taxes paid by the citizens of a given country.
This policy produces a sort of quest or JIF mania
for publishing in higher-ranked journals (Ioannidis & Thombs 2019). Therefore,
depending on the impact factor, a researcher has better chances
of evolving in his/her career, earn prestige, win grants, etc.
Thus, these metrics have a strong impact on how and
what scientific investigation can currently be conducted.
