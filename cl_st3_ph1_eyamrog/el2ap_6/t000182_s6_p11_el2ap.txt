Only B. herreri showed significant attraction to the black box
where the cockroach was confined, during the first 5-min period
in the still-air olfactometer. Thus, this species was able to
detect the cockroach in still air conditions at 10 cm
(78%, arena 2). Interestingly, the three species were attracted to
the cockroach odors after one hour. Probably, B. corredori and
B. ferroae reached the box containing the cockroach by chance
after one hour of trial-and-error, but it is worth to
note that all tested bugs continued walking close to this
box after that hour, thus a short-range attraction effect can
be inferred from this experiment; although proboscis extension was never
observed. They made attempts to climb the box, but cockroach’s
movements, and probably pungent odors, caused the triatomine bugs to
keep a distance. Such Belminus’ avoidance reaction merits further ethological
and physiological consideration. The difference between the initial attraction and
the attraction at the end of an hour could also
indicate that the cockroaches were not the preferred host, suggesting
that there is a greater latency to react to cues
emitted by cockroaches. Probably, these Belminus species have different hosts
in nature. Our knowledge of Belminus' sylvatic life is very
limited. For future studies, we suggest improvement of these arenas
in order to test olfaction alone, without any visual cues,
to determine whether olfaction is sufficient (or only required) to
elicit the FAP. We also recommend sampling and observing Belminus
bugs living in natural conditions, a real challenge!
