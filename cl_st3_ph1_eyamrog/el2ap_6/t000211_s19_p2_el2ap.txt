To act in this scenario, the University of Michigan Health
System, for example, published a complete study7 on the creation
of a temporary committee of specialists in VTE, vascular surgeons
and clinics, to review management protocols already established in the
institution. This committee would consult with other specialists in areas
such as pulmonology, hematology and medical clinic, among others, so
that a new action plan could be developed and executed
to better serve patients during the pandemic. For the decision
on the use of VTE prophylaxis, patients underwent assessment by
the Caprini score8 at the time of hospital admission. Although
there are not enough data to determine the incidence of
VTE in patients positive for COVID-19, there is already evidence
showing a reduction in mortality in patients with highly elevated
DD (> 3x the upper normal limit) receiving thromboprophylaxis with
non-fractionated (NFH) or low molecular weight (LMWH) heparin7. In addition,
VTE and primary pulmonary thrombus may be underlying etiologies potentially
responsible for the mortality of critically ill patients due to
COVID-19. In view of these findings and the fact that
less critical patients have a low risk of bleeding if
they use thromboprophylaxis, the study committee recommends routine thromboprophylaxis for
all patients hospitalized due to COVID-19, regardless of risk stratification.
