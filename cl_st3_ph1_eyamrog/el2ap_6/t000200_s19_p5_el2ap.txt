The results of the linear regression for Santa Catarina, stratified
by Health Regions and seasons, are presented in Table 2.
At this stage of the analysis, an investigation on the
temporal trend in the incidence of leptospirosis was conducted, based
on the months for two seasons, October to March (higher
rainfall levels) and April to September (lower rainfall levels). Upon
observing the results for Santa Catarina, the average rates of
leptospirosis approach those of the regions with greater occurrence of
the disease in the period, as well as to seasonal
periods observed individually, both those with higher and lower rainfall
rates. Still, based on the MPV, Santa Catarina presented temporal
trend of monthly increase in the rates of leptospirosis, in
the period of higher rainfall rates; and a decrease in
the period with lower ones.
