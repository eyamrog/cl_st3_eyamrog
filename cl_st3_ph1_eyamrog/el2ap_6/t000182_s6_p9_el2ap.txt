Immelmann (1983) underline that while appetitive behavior might contain taxis
components as well as FAP, not all taxis derive in
FAP. Clearly, the FAP requires an external stimulus to be
triggered but different modalities alone could be sufficient. In arena
1, phase 1, visual cues –if apparent to Belminus bugs–
were not sufficient to trigger the FAP or host mediated
taxis. Probably, the bug was not able to see the
cockroach through the glass. However, we have previously observed that
a visual cue –a plastic dummy resembling a drop of
water– is sufficient to elicit the FAP (Páez-Rondón et al.
2018). It is difficult to stablish which cues elicited the
FAP when the glass barrier was removed (phase 2) but,
certainly the FAP was triggered until completion by the presence
of the host, and probably visual cues played an important
role in this opportunity. Extension of the fixed bug’s proboscis
to the cockroach and sucking observed in arena 1 may
be catalogued as a reflexes (Páez-Rondón et al. 2018). Approach
to the cockroach (arena 1), to the black box containing
the cockroach (arena 2) and positive decisions made in the
Y-tube (arena 3) may be catalogued as taxis. Taxis, proboscis
extension and sucking are clearly part of the FAP, and
at some point there is a superposition of all of
them (Tinbergen 1951, Lorenz 1977, Eibl-Eibesfeldt I 1979). While, olfaction
was required in arenas 2 and 3 to elicit taxis
behavior, it was not sufficient to elicit the FAP.
