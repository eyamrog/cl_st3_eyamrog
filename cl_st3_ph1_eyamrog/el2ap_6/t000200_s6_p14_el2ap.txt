It is emphasized that the control of leptospirosis is based
on interventions on one or more links known to the
epidemiological chain, with potential ability to interrupt it. Based on
the analyzes performed in this study for Santa Catarina, it
can be said that the preventive measures and the fight
against leptospirosis should be established at the municipal level. This
approach may provide the details necessary for the identification of
critical areas and their population who are at greater risk
of contracting the disease.
