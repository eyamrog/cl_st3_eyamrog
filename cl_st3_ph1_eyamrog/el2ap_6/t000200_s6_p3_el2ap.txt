The study by Coelho and Massad17, held in SÃ£o Paulo,
showed a correlation between the climatic parameters and leptospirosis incidence.
Oliveira et al.18 and Pereira et al.19 identified that the
disease incidence was related to rainfall. It is worth mentioning
that these studies have also identified the disease occurring in
different seasons and pointed to the need for an active
search in other periods, detecting thus, other factors associated with
the disease, regardless of the rain.
