With the aim of protecting health-care workers, critically ill patients
with suspected or confirmed COVID- 19 infection should ideally be
admitted to an airborne infection isolation room that is at
negative pressure, as shown in Figure 1. The American Society
of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommended to use
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems that can protect
healthcare workers and instill confidence by providing safe environment for
their interactions with most contagious patients and reduce exposure when
patients discharge contaminants during procedure. However, it is recognized that
changing the outdoor air amount might impact building pressure balance
and also create humidity issues. As stated before, the small
size of a coronavirus particleallow it to stay airborne and
travel long distances carried by airflows in the rooms or
in the extract air ducts of ventilation systems [17].
