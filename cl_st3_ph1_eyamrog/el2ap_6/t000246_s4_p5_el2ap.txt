Because Lotka's Law provides a platform to measure the productivity
patterns of authors over a given period, it is known
that each area of a discipline can be associated with
an exponent, representing its specific rate of productivity of the
author. This is not enough to explain why one individual
should be more productive in producing dozens of published articles
on a subject, another individual produces few works and a
third individual produces none.
