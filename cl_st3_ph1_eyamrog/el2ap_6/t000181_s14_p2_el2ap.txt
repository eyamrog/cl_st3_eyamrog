Before answering the questionnaire, candidates read and accepted the Participant
Consent Form that explained the objective and nature of the
study and showed they could refuse to answer any question
and withdraw at any time from the research. Originally, 1875
participants were reached, but researchers had to exclude 31 incomplete
questionnaires – possibly because of internet slow-down access during the
questionnaire fill-out – making the final sample of 1844 people.
