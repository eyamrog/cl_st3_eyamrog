The species was originally described by Anastasiou (1964) with the
name Dactyllela appendiculata, with the presence of appendages. It may
have curved conidia when originated from curved spore primordium or
straight conidia when originated from a straight spore primordium. Later,
Nawawi (1976) described a new genus Laridospora recombining Dactyllela appendiculata
as Laridospora appendiculata, however observing only curved conidia and appendages.
Rubner & Gams considered L. appendiculata as Monacrosporium tentaculatum, considering
only its predatory behavior. The ecology and conidial appendages related
to aquatic habitat were not taken into account, considering that
M. tentaculatum is not an aquatic species (Rubner 1996). At
last, through molecular biology, Scholler et al. (1999) proposed M.
tentaculatum as synonymous with Dactyllelina appendiculata. This is the first
record of D. appendiculata in Brazil.
