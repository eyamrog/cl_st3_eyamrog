SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2), as well as
SARS- CoV from 2003 and MERS-CoV from 2012, is a
member of the Betacoronavirus genus of the Nidovirales order and
is currently the cause of the pandemic called COVID-19 (or
Coronavirus disease 2019). COVID-19 is characterized by cough, fever, fatigue,
and severe cases of pneumonia and has affected more than
9.1 million people worldwide until June 22nd, 2020. Here we
present a review of the cellular mechanisms associated with human
coronaviruses replication, including the unique molecular events related to the
replication transcription complex (RTC) of coronaviruses. Information regarding the interactions
between each viral protein and cellular proteins is presented, associating
to known host-pathogen implications for the coronavirus biology. Finally, a
specific topic addresses the current attempts for pharmacological interventions against
COVID-19, highlighting the possible effects of each drug on the
molecular events of viral replication. This review intends to contribute
to future studies for a better understanding of the SARS-
CoV-2 replication cycle and the development of pharmacological approaches targeting
COVID-19.
