Finally, associations were graphically explored among the variations in the
rates of leptospirosis according to the seasonal period, stratifying according
to the eight regions that showed the highest and lowest
rates of leptospirosis and the lowest and highest ratios of
cases by rainfall, in search for a potential cumulative influence
of rain on the incidence of the disease.
