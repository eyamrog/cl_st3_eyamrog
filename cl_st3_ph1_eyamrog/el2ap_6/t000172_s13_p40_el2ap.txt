CQ and HCQ have also shown anti-inflammatory activity and have
been used in inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis
(Sharma 2020). CQ and HCQ intervene with lysosomal acidification, inhibiting
antigen presentations, phospholipase A2, Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs), T and B
cell receptors, and production of cytokines, like IL-1 and IL-6
(Sinha and Balayla 2020). The inhibition of GSK3Î² by CQ
may also be responsible for its immunomodulatory activity against COVID-19
(Embi et al. 2020).
