The study included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 deaths, from
the first confirmed death until May 15, 2020. COVID-19 was
defined as a case with a positive result for viral
nucleic acid testing in respiratory specimens or with a positive
serological test. This data was collected from the official website6
that reports on the situation regarding COVID-19 in Brazil. The
data for model development were updated on May 16, 2020.
The rates of cumulative cases of disease per 1,000,000 inhabitants
were calculated considering the number of COVID-19 deaths in each
state divided by the population at risk based on the
estimates for the states, according to the Brazilian Institute of
Geography and Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat√≠stica- IBGE).11
