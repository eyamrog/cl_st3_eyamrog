The cities of the health macro-regions Central, South Central, South
and Northern Triangle accounted for 59% of the cities above
the third quartile of the RT-PCR test rate (between 1.1
and 2.8). In turn, the analysis of the same quartile
for rapid tests (between 3.4 and 12.58) showed a more
homogeneous representation of other regions. However, the cities in the
Central and Northern Triangle regions still represented the majority of
cities in this category. In fact, the Central, Central South
and Northern Triangle regions revealed the highest test rates (both
rapid and molecular).
