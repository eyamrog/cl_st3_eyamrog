Finding a professional community that “normalizes” their work produces an
effect described as that one capable of mitigating the vulnerability
linked to stigma (O’Donnell, Weitz, Freedman 2011). A female professional
declares that “if the so-called abortionists, that is to say
we ourselves, are 300 and come out and stick up
for this cause ( women’s right to abortion), we cannot
be that bad… that is what is entailed by the
idea of ‘common sense’” (S. female, social worker. Interview, Córdoba,
August 2017), highlighting the importance given to a collective declaration
of support for the task done.
