â€¢ The use of personal protective equipment (PPE), consisting of
N95 mask or air purifying respirator, goggles, sterile waterproof suits
and double layer of sterile gloves by the surgical team,
which must be composed of the as few people as
possible. The study indicates that the air-purifying respirator is ideal
for prolonged surgeries (more than 3 hours), as it is
more comfortable for the surgeon. A relevant point is that
vascular surgeons should be aware of the complexity of using
magnifying surgical loupes associated with the use of PPE when
operating suspected or positive COVID-19 patients, especially when performing their
removal and cleaning.
