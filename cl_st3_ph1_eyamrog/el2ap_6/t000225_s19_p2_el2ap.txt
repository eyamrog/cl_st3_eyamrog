Three sequential trends in the data relating the number of
deaths per day attributed to COVID-19 can be identified in
Figure 1. There is a steep rise in the recorded
events from March 17th to April 5th, at a rate
of about 5.2 deaths per day. After that, a flatten­
ing was seen until April 19th, followed by a second
rise. We limit the period to April 27th because there
is a (potential) 14-day delay between the death and the
consolidation of information on the website, and more recent data
is not consolidated at the date we fin­ ished the
present article.
