Coronaviruses (CoV) are a specific type of group virus which
include ribonucleic acid (RNA) in its genetic material [1]. Their
primary targets are epithelial cells of the respiratory and gastrointestinal
tracts, which facilitates the transmission of the viral load through
different ways such as fomites, airborne or faecal-oral [2]. In
early January 2020, the - Chinese Center for Disease Control
and Prevention [3] reported a novel coronavirus (SARS- COVID-2) as
the causative agent of a human disease named COVID-19. Late
January 2020, the World Health Organisation declared a public health
emergency of international concern, and a global pandemic later was
announced, in March 2020 [4]. As of 4 June 2020,
COVID- 19 had affected 213 countries and territories around the
world, translated in more than 6 million cases and almost
400 thousand deaths worldwide [5].
