Most of the patients with COVID-19 have mild disease symptoms2.
However, few patients can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
and other complications, including thrombotic phenomena in macro- and micro-circulation2-5.
Coagulopathy is commonly observed in ARDS/sepsis and can predict outcomes
in severe/critical COVID-19 cases2-5, 3-6. Abnormal coagulation parameters (elevated levels
of D-dimer and fibrin degradation products) significantly correlate with mortality
in patients with COVID-196. Moreover, the SARS-CoV-2 may induce a
cytokine storm along with activation of the coagulation cascade that
leads to the thrombotic phenomena5,7.
