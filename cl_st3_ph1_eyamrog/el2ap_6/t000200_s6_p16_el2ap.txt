It should be noted that a potentiating factor in the
spread of leptospirosis is to be present in heavy seasonal
rains that cause floods, even when the rains are of
lesser volume, once that the waterproofing of the soil interferes
in the absorption of water and favors the flooding increase.
It is also believed that in periods with more rains
and, consequently, more floods, the leptospirosis dissemination is larger, both
for the population and for health professionals, and, of course,
the demand for health services is faster, with earlier and
more appropriate diagnosis and treatment.
