We found stability in the scores of three scales. The
advantage of our scales compared to others is that they
are reasonably short and report adequate levels of internal consistency.
This is relevant since many scales like the Warr-Cook-Wall Job
Satisfaction Scale 38 provide little variability and require a large
amount of items to achieve stable values (25).
