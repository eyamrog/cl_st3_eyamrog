For 50 years, different types of coronaviruses have been listed
as a cause of respiratory infections (1). However, in December
2019, several cases of pneumonia with unknown etiology were documented
in the city of Wuhan, China. Afterwards, Chinese authorities isolated
and identified a novel type of coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, which
has a phylogenetic similarity with other beta-coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, coronavirus
of the severe acute respiratory syndrome, and MERS-CoV, responsible for
the Middle East respiratory syndrome (2). Recently, COVID-19 was declared
a pandemic by the World Health Organization (1-3).
