During the first 5 min B. herreri orientated their walks
toward the cockroach (78%, P=0.012), however B. corredori (65%, P=0.169)
and B. ferroae (58%, P=0.193) orientation did not significantly differ
from random (Fig 2). The chi-square test of independence showed
that the three species did not behave differently (P=0.501). Thus,
when we tested the three species a as group (n=56);
Belminus genus oriented its walk towards the cockroach (68%, P=0.0029).
