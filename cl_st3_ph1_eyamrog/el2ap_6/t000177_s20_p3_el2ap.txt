The role of healthcare workers (HCW) in the transmission of
pathogens from patient-to-patient is well documented. However, increasing evidence reports
the contaminated environment as highly significant in pathogen transmission. A
number of factors, including temperature, humidity and severity could influence
the concentration of viral particles in an aerosol sample [38].
