Therefore, conducting studies of temporal trend is appropriate in order
to analyze the association of leptospirosis with the rainfall indexes
in Santa Catarina State and its Health Regions, considering that
there are few studies about leptospirosis and its relationship with
the rainfall levels, and the potential contribution of epidemiological surveillance
to risk assessment and management. Such studies increase the ability
to respond to natural disasters in Santa Catarina and contribute
to measures for the prevention and control of leptospirosis to
be more effective.
