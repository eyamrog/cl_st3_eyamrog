The increasing popularity of preprints might render double-blind review unfeasible,
and open identities unavoidable. Unfortunately, no experimental study to this
date has examined the effects of transitioning from double-blind to
open identities. Scholarly journals currently using double-blind peer review should
ideally participate in randomized trials to examine the effects of
such a transition on the quality and bias of peer
review.
