But if, on the one hand, as described by Dong
and Bouey (29), fear and anxiety are common psychological responses
during disasters and other similar situations, the entire population is
more vulnerable to the development of mental disease in these
critical events, especially the anxiety disorders. These mental disorders are
classified, according to the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of mental disorders (DSM-5), into a generalised anxiety
disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, separation anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder,
specific phobias and selective mutism (30).
