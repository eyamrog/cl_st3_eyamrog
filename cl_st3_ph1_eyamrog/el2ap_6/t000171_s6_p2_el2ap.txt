Similarly to the incidence rate, the mortality rate follows, to
a greater or lesser degree, the same pattern of regional
distribution. The present study revealed that the Vale do AÃ§o,
Northern Triangle and Southeast regions had the highest mortality rates,
while the Central region exhibited the highest absolute number of
deaths. Based on the literature, it can be inferred that
the causes of this pattern of territorial distribution are due
to anthropogenic and environmental factors that can contribute to the
spread of the virus (11-13), including climatic factors (14), transport
flows (13, 15), economic activity (13, 14) and air pollution
(12).
