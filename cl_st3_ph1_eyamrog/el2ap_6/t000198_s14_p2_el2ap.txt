Ranked as the global largest economy, the USA is located
in central North America with a population of over 300
million inhabitants [12]. The HDI index of 0.924 ranks the
13th global position [9]. When compared to most higher education
systems around the world, the U.S. system is mostly independent
of federal government regulation, and it is highly decentralized. The
educational system receives funds from many public and private sources,
including tuition, federal and state funds, as well as endowments
[13]. Dental education in the USA is a professional training
after a college degree. Students must obtain a bachelorâ€™s degree
at a university or college before applying to any of
the 66 existing dental school. The University of Pittsburgh is
one of four educational institutions where training in dentistry is
offered in the Pennsylvania North-eastern state (Figure 1). There are
nearly 400 dental students enrolled.
