(Freshwater hyphomycetes in a preserved insular system from Brazil: first
records at Parque Estadual da Ilha do Cardoso, municipality of
Cananéia, São Paulo State). To survey freshwater hyphomycetes from insular
water bodies at the Parque Estadual da Ilha do Cardoso
State Park, in Cananéia municipality, São Paulo State, Brazil, submerged
mixed leaf litter samples were collected from six sites from
June 2012 to February 2013. The samples were taken to
the laboratory and incubated in Petri dishes containing sterile distilled
water at room temperature (20oC). From the 5th day on,
until at least one month, fragments of the leaf litter
samples were examined under the microscope, resulting in the morphological
identification of 33 taxa. Among those, two are new records
for the state of São Paulo and four for Brazil.
Descriptions and pictures of each new record are presented.
