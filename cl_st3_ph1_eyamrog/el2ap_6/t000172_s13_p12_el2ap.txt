The PLpro protein (nsp3) from SARS-CoV significantly triggered the activation
of the TGF-Î²1 promoter through ROS/p38-MAPK/STAT3, correlating with the positive
regulation of pro-fibrotic responses in vitro and in vivo (Li
et al. 2016). Another study showed that p53 downregulates SARS-CoV
replication and is a target of nsp3 via an E3
ubiquitin ligase (Ma-Lauer et al. 2016). The other viral protease,
3CLpro (nsp5), was proven to cleave STAT2, but not JAK1,
TYK2, STAT1, and IRF9, which are key molecules of the
JAK-STAT pathway, antagonizing the type I interferon signaling (Zhu et
al. 2017).
