As a diverse phylogenetically diverse group (Belliveau & Barlocher 2005,
Duarte et al. 2015), aquatic anamorphic fungi are classified into
four groups according to their tolerance to submergence or requirement
of water for the conidiogenesis: aeroaquatic hyphomycetes, terrestrial aquatic hyphomycetes,
submerged aquatic hyphomycetes and ingoldian hyphomycetes (Goh & Hyde 1996).
