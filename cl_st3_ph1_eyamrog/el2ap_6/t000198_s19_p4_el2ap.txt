The forced period of isolation had an evident impact on
dental students at the University of Pittsburgh. U.S. dental students
are typically older than the corresponding students from Brazil. On
average, they are four years older than Brazilian students, which
cause a substantial financial investment in their education. The full
dental course at the University of Pittsburgh costs US$300,000 and,
consequently, changes in how the learning was delivered to finish
the semester due to COVID-19, created more anxiety. Online teaching
was delivered with the offering of some additional contacts for
guidance and emotional support. Besides teaching, other experiences such as
research and service were profoundly affected as well.
