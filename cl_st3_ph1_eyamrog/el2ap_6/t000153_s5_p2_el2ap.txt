Inside the Network, there occurred a promotion of the debate
over the official documents regarding abortion provision, produced by the
Ministry of Health. At the same time, through training sessions
organized by lawyers, knowledge about a different interpretation of criminal
law was promoted, together with information on the successful experiences
enjoyed in the public health system of other countries (mostly
the cases of Colombia and Spain). This process was fostered
by interdisciplinary work, including meetings with lawyers and other legal
operators. The work done by feminist women lawyers stood out
as they became organized to face the hegemony of conservative
sectors in the legal field, particularly regarding matters linked to
the debate over sexual and reproductive rights. In other words,
the socialization of information on legal aspects and on institutional
protocols led the members of the Network to strengthen their
professional practice in relation to abortion, finding support in the
very tools proposed by the State. These actions demonstrate the
pros associated with belonging to a space that provides opportunities
for professional training and development.
