During the current pandemic, patients with demyelinating diseases should be
vaccinated against influenza, as this respiratory virus can coinfect patients
and lead to severe clinical symptoms. As response to the
pneumococcal vaccine is severely impaired when associated with the use
of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies67,68, we recommend all patients receive pneumococcal
vaccination 2– 3 weeks prior therapy initiation in a stepwise
schedule (i.e., PCV13 prime followed by PPSV23 boost), with an
interval of at least 8 weeks between the two vaccinations64,65.
In patients receiving anti-CD20 therapies, vaccination must start at least
2–3 weeks before treatment or 5–7 months after the last
infusion68.
