Similarly, B. corredori (P=0.001) and B. ferroae (P=0.008) avoided the
extreme of the Y- olfactometer when provided with the headscape
of mouse wastes (Fig 3). The chi-square test of independence
showed that there was no significant relation between species and
behavioral responses (P=0.477); Belminus genus (n=48) avoided volatiles emanating from
mouse wastes (79%, P=0.000023).
