An important distinction should be made between two categories of
self-citation, individual (author) and collective (journal) self-citation, although both potentially
result in a boost of bibliometric indexes. There are many
legitimate reasons for a researcher to cite his/her earlier works;
in many cases, self-citations are unavoidable, depending on the circumstances
or subject (Glänzel 2008). For example, an author could have
been the single authority on a taxon during the last
thirty years or present a high production in a specialized
field. In these situations, self-citation alone is not necessarily fraudulent.
Concerns arise when similar citations are not received in the
work of other researchers in the field (Haustein & Larivière
2015) or, more commonly, based on the myth that self-citations
help to artificially increase one's own position in the community
(Glänzel 2008). Differently, collective (journal) self-citation would be more problematic
and is most probably a side-effect of the JIF mania,
caused by the competition among journals for higher journal ranking,
prestige, and higher monetary earnings through higher subscription pricing, which
is often connected to journal-level bibliometrics. Dear readers do not
be naïve: academic publications are million dollars businesses, truly having
high profit margins (Monbiot 2011, Larivière et al. 2015). It
is thus not surprising that journals engage in “impact factor
wars” to manipulate their metrics using strategies such as citation
stacking, enlargement of cited references during the review process to
include papers from the own journal (sometimes even coercive self-citation),
and rejection of studies with low potential of citation (Haustein
& Larivière 2015). Thus, a high level of self-citations in
a journal is not easy to understand and should be
checked with caution.
