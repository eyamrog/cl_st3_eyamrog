Table 1 shows the seasonal variation of cases and rainfall
indexes in Santa Catarina (2005–2015), according to the 16 Health
Regions. An average number of 329 cases of leptospirosis by
Health Region in the period showed minimal variability of 24
cases (Serra Catarinense) and a maximum of 1,458 cases (Northeast).
Four regions (Foz do Rio Itajaí, Médio Vale do Itajaí,
Grande Florianópolis, and Northeast) were responsible for 3,789 (71.8%) cases
of leptospirosis; 1,458 (38.5%) occurred in the Northeast region. When
considering the size of the population in each of the
regions, the variation in rates was 0.70 cases/100,000 inhabitants in
Serra Catarinense, 13.99 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the Northeast.
However, the Far West, with the second highest rate (11.18
cases of leptospirosis/100,000 inhabitants), together with the four regions previously
mentioned (Foz do Rio Itajaí, Médio Vale do Itajaí, Grande
Florianópolis, and the Northeast region), are responsible for the higher
incidence of leptospirosis. These five regions, with the highest rates,
presented a risk of higher incidence of leptospirosis (RR >
1), ranging from approximately 11 to 20 times more new
cases of leptospirosis (RR = 10.9–19.9), when compared to the
region with the lowest rate in the period (Serra Catarinense).
The average rainfall rate for Santa Catarina was 158.69 mm,
with extremes of 136.44 mm in the region of Laguna
to 186.81 mm in the Northeast region. The five regions,
described above, with the highest rates of leptospirosis, contributed with
32.8% of the rainfall accumulated in the period, two of
which, Far West and Northeast, presented both the highest leptospirosis
and average rainfall rates.
