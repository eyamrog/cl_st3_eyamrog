Finally, the Michigan Medicine team touch on long-term anticoagulant therapy.
In patients treated with anticoagulants and who are unable to
undergo imaging tests for diagnostic purposes during the COVID-19 outbreak,
they recommend treatment with direct oral anticoagulants or vitamin K
antagonists for one to two months after hospital discharge, until
an image examination can be done. For patients considered to
be at moderate to high risk for PE, a CT
scan should be requested within one month once they are
considered negative for COVID-19. For patients considered to be at
high risk for DVT, a lower limb ECD should be
requested again once they are considered negative for COVID-19. All
patients should be followed and provided recommendations for long-term duration
of therapy7.
