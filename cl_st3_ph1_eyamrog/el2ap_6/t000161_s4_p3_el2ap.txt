We emphasize that menace to taxonomy comes not much from
the suppression of any specific journal from a bibliometric platform
belonging to a big company. Much more harm is caused
by the limited renewal of professional positions and the loss
of collections, such as the huge ones that were housed
at the Museu Nacional of the Federal University of Rio
de Janeiro. These are the real issues that should motivate
the engagement and action of taxonomists around the world. In
short and loud, taxonomy is produced by taxonomists, not by
journals. We recognize the deep impact the JIF mania has
on the careers of taxonomists, due to governmental policies that
embraced bibliometric evaluations in a highly competitive environment, with researchers
struggling for limited grants. However, our current challenges cannot be
dealt with through endorsement of the status quo. We need
to change the focus. Also, it is contradictory to argue
in favor of the reinstatement of Zootaxa to the JIF
without considering that this journal has this index influenced by
the currently high levels of self-citation. Regardless of its real
significance, JIF is considered one of the attractive qualities of
Zootaxa. The bibliometrics game in science has its own rules.
An honorable choice would be to reject bibliometric indexes altogether,
including JIF, instead of considering them when convenient. We are
seeing a bankruptcy of the system of scientific publications devoted
to the knowledge on biodiversity, at least for researchers, and
it would be much better if the system could be
somehow reinvented with ways to support diamond open access (DOA)
as its main goal.
