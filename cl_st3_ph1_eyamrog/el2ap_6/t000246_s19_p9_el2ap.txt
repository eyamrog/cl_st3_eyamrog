The 1623 SARS documents were published in 532 different journals.
After Bradford law enforcement, 15 journals were found in the
core, 86 in zone 1 and 532 in zone 2.
Tables 1 and 2 present the distribution of the journals
and their production, according to the Nucleus the two zones,
as well as the values of the Bradford Multiplier (Bm),
the latter being calculated to demonstrate that the number of
journals contained in the Nucleus is equivalent to the set
of journals most devoted to SARS, since its oscillation between
the zones did not exceed the maximum value of 0.7.
