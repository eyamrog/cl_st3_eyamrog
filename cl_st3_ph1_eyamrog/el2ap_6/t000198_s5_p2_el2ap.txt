The return to face-to-face activities, including pre-clinical and clinical teaching,
is preceded by an extensive discussion and elaboration of protocols
for the establishment of a new routine. The Brazilian Dental
Education Association (ABENO) promotes a national debate. It proposes the
creation of dental infection control or biosafety commission in each
educational institution to carry out the diagnosis, infection control, and
continuing education for all people involved. In public institutions, like
the Federal University of Para√≠ba, the main challenges are related
to the adequacy of the physical structure, availability of human
resources, and acquisition of materials for the personal protection of
teachers, students, and oral health technicians. The preparation of a
strategic plan for the return to activities is expected, considering
epidemiological indicators and occupancy rate of hospital beds for treatment
of COVID 19.
