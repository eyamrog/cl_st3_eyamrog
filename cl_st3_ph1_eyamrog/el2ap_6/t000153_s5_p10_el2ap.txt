Reports show that stigma indicators, such as the negative self-perception
of the job done, the fear of information disclosure and
of detachment from fellow professionals, together with the fear of
an open disapproval of their job (Oâ€™Donnell, Weitz, Freedman 2011),
are not discursively present among the members of the Network.
These providers of the service of abortion do not consider
their job as sinful, dirty or polluted (Hughes 1958). These
conceptualizations are, in the end, social constructions, historically situated and
attributed, which they know they face, but they have not
internalized. They state that forging greater professional bonds, which entail
the possibility of disclosing, among their peers, what they do
in their workplace, serve as strategies that allow to fight
the interpersonal disconnections produced by the stigma of abortion (Martin,
Debbink, Hassinger, Youatt, 2014).
