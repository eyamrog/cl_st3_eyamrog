Belminus bite was not toxic to the cockroach but rather
analgesic. Furthermore, when rearing Belminus triatomines in our laboratory we
have observed that a single cockroach is able to survive
after being bitten by a dozens of these bugs for
many months (data not shown). Most predator reduviids have highly
toxic venoms which kill the prey immediately (Walker et al.
2018). Triatomine saliva is not that toxic but is able
to inhibit voltage-gated sodium channels which may account for the
anesthetic effect (Walker et al. 2016). From these physiological studies
and our ethological observations we might conclude that Belminus are
not able to kill its prey but to parasite its
host. The use of the terms parasite and host could
be debated since triatomines do not live directly on the
host â€“as ticks, lice or fleas. However, triatomines closely share
their lives with their hosts, in the same refuge, and
that is why Guerin et al. (2000) called them ectoparasites.
Alternatively, we could also call triatomines carnivores (Cobben 1979, Livingstone
et al. 1998), zoophagous (Boyd et al. 2002) or micropredators
(Poulin and Randhawa 2013, Wilson et al. 2017). But these
categories are less concrete; for example, contrary to mosquitos, which
have been catalogued as micropredators, triatomines live closely associated with
their host. In any case, the purpose that prevails here
is to behaviorally and phylogenetically distinguish triatomines from the rest
of reduviids. The parasitic strategy (kleptophagy) described in this study
is found only in one taxon (Triatominae), but not found
in any other outgroup reduviid taxa (Reduviidae subfamilies).
