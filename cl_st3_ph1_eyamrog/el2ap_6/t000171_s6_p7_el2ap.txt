Across the state, at the municipal level, there was a
positive correlation between the rate of rapid tests and incidence
and the rate of RT-PCR tests and incidence. Also, the
rates of RT-PCR tests and mortality remained positively correlated and
more concentrated in three health macro-regions (Central, Central South and
Northern Triangle). Besides that, there was a notable negative correlation
between time and test rates, at the municipal and regional
level.
