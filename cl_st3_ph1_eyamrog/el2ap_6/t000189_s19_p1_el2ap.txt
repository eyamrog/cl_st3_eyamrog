The search for articles resulted in the identification of 1,691
articles corresponding to the respective surveyed micronutrients. Of these, we
excluded 29 because they were duplicated. Among the remaining 1,662,
after applying the eligibility criteria based on the information provided
in the titles and abstracts 1,615 were eliminated. A total
of 47 articles were read in full and, in the
final stage, 6 studies were considered eligible for this review
(Figure 1).
