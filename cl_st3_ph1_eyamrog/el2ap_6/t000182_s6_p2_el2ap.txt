Furthermore, according to Tinbergen (1963) an ethologist will attempt to
recognize elements of animal’s own behavior; we showed that kleptophagy
is a phenomena proper (sensu Portmann 1967, Kleisner 2008, Kleisner
2015, Aldana and Otálora-Luna 2019) of Belminus genus and the
rest of triatomines. The manner in which Belminus bugs approached
the cockroach, performing a highly stereotyped sequence that ended in
proboscis lifting and sucking, and that did not result in
the immediate death of the host, defines its phyloegentic relationship
within Triatominae.
