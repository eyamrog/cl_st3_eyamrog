In addition to Brazil, other countries that have also provided
financial assistance to families include: the United States, through the
Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP); Peru, with the transfer of
cash rations through the Qali Warma National School Food Program;
and many others. According to the WFP, at least 10
countries have adopted a strategy of transferring cash rations to
family members in order to mitigate this problem. This is
a measure that can be effective; however, other difficulties can
be faced by families, such as bearing the costs of
preparing food, which can be a difficult task under a
scenario of high unemployment.
