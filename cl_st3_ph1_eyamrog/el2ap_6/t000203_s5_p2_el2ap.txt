One of the biggest criticisms to the work published by
this group regarding the first phase of this work6 was
that, in the analysis of April 11th, the highest incidence,
mortality and lethality rates of the groups of countries without
an active program would be because these countries were on
average ten days ahead of the group of countries with
an active program. In this second phase, in order to
minimize the time bias, the strategy adopted was to compare
the current data, from April 11 to May 11, of
countries with active vaccination with the data up to April
11 of countries without active vaccination. As a result, the
average is now 20 days ahead of the possible bias
of the previous work. Thus, Tables 3, 4, and 5
show that, even though they advance in time, the countries
in the active vaccination group remain with 0510152025303540ChinaIndiaHungaryAustriaIranBrazilTurkiaChileItalySpainBelgiumUnited KingdomIreland the
reasons for the higher rates. Data that refute the idea
of temporal correlation and maintenance of the same behavior of
severity of the disease impact.
