Unfortunately, double-blind review is essentially incompatible with preprints, especially journal-led
preprints, when scholarly journals routinely deposit their pre-review manuscripts in
preprint servers such as SciELO Preprints or EmeRI. The incompatibility
is even more pronounced with EmeRI, as it encourages preprint
readers to volunteer to review the manuscripts for corresponding journals
(open participation). Other traits of open peer review are not
so incompatible with double-blind review: open reports need not be
signed, open interaction can be anonymized by editorial platforms such
as OJS 3, nothing stops decoupled peer review from being
double-blind, and open commenting on the final version complements rather
than substitutes traditional peer review.
