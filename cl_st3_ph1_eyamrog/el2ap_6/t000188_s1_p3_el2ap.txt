Results: The model data were well-fitted, with R2 values close
to 0.999. Up to May 15, 14,817 COVID-19 deaths were
confirmed in the country. Amazonas has the highest rate of
accumulated cases per 1,000,000 inhabitants (321.14), followed by Ceará (161.63).
We estimated that Rio de Janeiro, Roraima, Amazonas, Pará, and
Pernambuco will experience a substantial increase in the rate of
cumulative cases until July 15. Mato Grosso do Sul, Paraná,
Minas Gerais, Rio Grande do Sul, and Santa Catarina will
show lower rates per 1,000,000 inhabitants.
