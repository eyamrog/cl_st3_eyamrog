Despite this, the temporal correlation was even more pronounced (Figure
3). At the municipal level, the analysis of the association
between the elapsed time of the First Notified Case in
the state of Minas Gerais and rapid tests produced a
coefficient of -0.11; between the first notified case and RT-PCR
tests, the coefficient was -0.22; between the first notified case
and incidence rate, it was -0.25; and between the first
notified case and mortality rate, -0.19.
