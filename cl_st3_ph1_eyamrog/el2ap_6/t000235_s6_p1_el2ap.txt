This case report described a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 who
developed acute PE several days after the onset of viral
pneumonia. Before the outbreak of COVID-19, case reports had already
described concurrent PE and viral lung infections9. Visseren et al.10
concluded that respiratory viruses induce procoagulant activity in cultured human
endothelial cells, although coronaviruses were not included in their study
(published in 2000). A proinflammatory, hypercoagulable state may occur in
patients with severe/critical COVID-19 symptoms, and possibly plays an important
role in the development of PE1,4,5,9. Another factor that may
favor the formation of PE is reduced physical movement due
to quarantine restrictions or hospitalization (elevated risk of deep vein
thrombosis)1. The published pathological reports and verbal communications have described
presence of microvascular thrombosis and PE in the few cases
with COVID-19 autopsied to date4. However, further studies are necessary
to better comprehend the incidence of PE in the patients
with COVID-19, and to ascertain the exact pathophysiological mechanisms involved.
