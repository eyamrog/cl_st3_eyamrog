For future studies, we suggest to test olfaction and visual
cues alone, using a cockroach dummy or providing multimodal stimuli
on the servosphere –to see whether olfaction is sufficient –or
only required– to elicit FAP. We also suggest to combine
different stimuli to clarify how convergence between visual (different light
treatments) and olfactory cues works (Reisenman et al. 2000, Otálora-Luna
and Dickens 2011).
