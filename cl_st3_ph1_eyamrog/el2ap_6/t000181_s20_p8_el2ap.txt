The scores are in harmony with results of a nationwide
survey of psychological distress among Chinese people in the Covid-19
where female respondents showed significantly higher psychological distress and more
likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder than their male counterparts
(Ahorsu, Lin, Imani, Saffari, Griffiths & Pakpour, 2020; Jia, Ayling,
Chalder, Massey, Broadbent, Coupland & Vedhara, 2020). Besides, Brazilian CPDI
gender mean scores (41.1 and 33.2) in our research are
higher than Chinese ones (24.87 and 21.41) (Ahorsu, Lin, Imani,
Saffari, Griffiths & Pakpour, 2020).
