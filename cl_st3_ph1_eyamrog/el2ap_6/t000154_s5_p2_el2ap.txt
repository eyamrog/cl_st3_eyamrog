This survey’s participants were markedly less experienced with open peer
review than those in Ross-Hellauer et al. (2017), besides being
somewhat younger. Furthermore, this survey’s participants were from a small
medical specialty in a middle-income country in Latin America, and
are arguably used to open access journals and double-blind peer
review, where participants in Ross-Hellauer et al. (2017) were generally
from the natural sciences in Europe, and many of them
are arguably more used to single-blind peer review. This survey
had probably fewer to no participants from the publishing industry,
but we did not capture this information to avoid breaking
anonymity.
