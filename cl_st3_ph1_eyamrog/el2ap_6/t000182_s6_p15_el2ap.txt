Strict blood-feeding has been considered a behavioral feature that group
Triatominae (Lent and Wygodzinsky 1979). However, as Belminus does not
strictly depend on blood, such taxonomic character must be revised.
The inconsistency does not necessarily compromises the systematic identification of
the group. A proper behavioral category shall comprise Belminus as
a triatomine. As kleptophagy is hitherto an advanced and unusual
feature in Hemiptera and in Reduviidae itself, we believe Triatominae
is a single evolutionary unit that has evolved only once
â€“i.e. Triatominae is monophyletic (sensu Schaefer 2005). During the course
of evolution Belminus bugs have selected and adapted those behavioral
sequences that fit better to a) their ancestral constraints (Triatominae),
b) physiological needs (carnivorous) and c) ecological scenarios (ectoparasitism). One
surmises that kleptophagic behaviors of Belminus species detailed here have
contributed to their match to the synanthropic niche. The presence
of cockroaches in human houses facilitates Belminus species adaptation to
the human habitat, where both cockroaches and humans are potential
targets.
