CPDI scale shows that anxiety, exhaustion, and attention deficit were
the factors with higher scores with important gender differences. Women
showed higher levels of anxiety as they answered about feeling
anxious during the pandemic as often (30.5%) and most of
the time (23.7%). Men, on the contrary, showed lower levels
of anxiety as they felt it often (21.2%) and most
of the time (13.6%). A study with 2766 volunteers, Maza
et al., (2020) assessed anxiety during the pandemic. Results showed
high levels as ranges varied from medium (81.3%), high (7.2%)
and extremely high (11.5%) associated with young age, female gender,
family members infected with Covid-19, and a history of stressful
situations and medical problems (Maza et al., 2020).
