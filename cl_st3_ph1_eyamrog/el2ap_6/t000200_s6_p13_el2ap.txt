In the same way, Dutra et al.22, in Minas Gerais
State, Brazil, upon investigating the occurrence of the disease over
the months, from 1998 to 2012, observed that leptospirosis rates
showed an increasing trend in the rainy months. On the
other hand, Pereira et al.19, when studying the trend and
seasonality of leptospirosis in Brazil, found that although the growth
of the disease was not detected in the studied period
(2008–2012), correlating the results through a series adjusted by seasonality
suggested the presence of a seasonal component of the historical
series with strong temporal relationship, also noting that the pursuit
of the disease is more active during rainy periods. Finally,
Buzzar23, upon analyzing the epidemiological profile of leptospirosis in São
Paulo (2007–2011), also found that the disease focused in all
28 groups of epidemiological surveillance, throughout the year and with
clear seasonality, according to the findings of the present study.
