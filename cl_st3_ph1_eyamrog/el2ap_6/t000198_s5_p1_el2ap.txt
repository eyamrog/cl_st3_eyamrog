At the point of writing this paper (mid-June 2020), countries
were facing different epidemic realities of the COVID-19 crisis. Brazil
was close to the peak of its epidemic curve, the
US was lowering the curve, and Australia had flattened it,
reaching a level of the almost complete elimination of new
cases. It is therefore interesting to compare how each country
is planning and executing their return to “normal” clinical teaching
in Dentistry.
