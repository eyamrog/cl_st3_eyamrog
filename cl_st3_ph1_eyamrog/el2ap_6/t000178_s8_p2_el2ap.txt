Bioinformatics, the discipline that uses computational approaches to answer biological
questions, has become essential to analyze genetic and genomic information
(Baxevanis and Ouellette 2005). Especially, to study large and complex
DNA datasets obtained via next- generation sequencing (NGS), to discover
new genes, functions, pathways, and molecular interactions. Most of this
information is available in online public databases. For instance, GenBank
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank), at the National Center for Biotechnology Information from the
US National Institute of Health, currently possess 216,531,829 sequences, being
one of the largest source worldwide. Other databases such as
the Barcode of Life Data System (https://www.boldsystems.org), 2,869,168 sequences, are
more specific, providing information from specific eukaryotic genes.
