It is not a surprise that the same institutions are
actively submitting data to different databases because they host strong
research groups related to emerging and infectious diseases, biodiversity, and
biotechnology. However, most of them are based in Lima, Peruâ€™s
capital. We believe that, to increase diversity and representativeness, funding
efforts should be directed to more regional research groups and
other highly diverse taxa, for instance, non-pathogenic bacteria, archaea, non-vertebrates
and non-flowering plants.
