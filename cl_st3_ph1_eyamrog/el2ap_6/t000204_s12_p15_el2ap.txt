Concerning the possibility of exposure to triggering stimuli, it is
estimated that up to 50 to 60% of the North
American population may be exposed to at least one traumatic
event in life (25) and although most individuals recover from
the traumatic experience, about 10 to 30% develop post-traumatic stress
disorder and, although pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment is often effective,
20 to 30% of patients with this condition do not
respond to conventional therapies (26).
