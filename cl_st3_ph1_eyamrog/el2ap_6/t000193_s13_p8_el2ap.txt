Some acute demyelinating events do not fulfill the MS or
NMOSD diagnostic criteria. They include: acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), idiopathic
isolated ON, and idiopathic isolated TM. We suggest treating these
events with intravenous steroids, immunoglobulin, and plasma exchange, as performed
outside the pandemic context. These conditions do not usually require
long-term immunotherapy9.
