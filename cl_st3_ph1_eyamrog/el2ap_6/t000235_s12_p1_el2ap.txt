Here, we present the case of a 52-year-old male patient
who visited our emergency department with a 5-day history of
fever, myalgia, abdominal pain, headache, cough, and dyspnea. The patient
reported asthma, but no recent attack. He denied other comorbidities,
smoking, or continued medication use. On admission, the patientâ€™s vital
signs were normal, with peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) >95%. The
white blood cell (WBC) count and C-reactive protein level showed
no significant abnormalities. Rapid influenza diagnostic test was negative. The
patient underwent a non-enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) scan that
revealed few scattered ground-glass opacities in both the lungs, with
a predominantly peripheral distribution (Figure 1A). Real- time reverse-transcription polymerase
chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of the nasopharyngeal swab tested positive for
the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, thereby confirming the diagnosis of COVID-19.
He was hospitalized for 3 days. Antibiotic therapy (azithromycin) was
administered.
