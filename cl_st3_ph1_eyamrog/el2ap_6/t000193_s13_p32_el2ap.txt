Rituximab is frequently used for the treatment of NMOSD. Rituximab
leads to an increased risk of severe viral infections by
several mechanisms, as described above. Immunoglobulin monitoring and replacement, as
appropriate, may be a strategy to reduce infection risk. Regarding
B-cell monitoring in NMOSD, targeting CD27+ memory B-cells rather than
CD19+ B-cells is more likely to provide a better measure
of rituximab efficacy. In a study, more than half of
NMOSD relapses occurred at CD19+ B-cell counts below 0.01 Ã—
109/L but above the therapeutic threshold for CD27+ memory B-cells.
As CD27 markers are not available in clinical practice and,
as in NMOSD relapses, can be fatal, we suggest continuing
rituximab dosing at regular 6 months intervals51.
