Peru is one of the most biodiverse countries in the
world. Current estimates of species richness showed the occurrence of
numerous species, such as plants (20 533), vertebrates (5 738),
and arthropods (30 547) (MINAM, 2019). There are no current
records of the extant Peruvian diversity of bacteria or archaea,
though. Conservation and management of this vast biodiversity requires different
approaches considering ecological and systematic knowledge, and, recently, information about
genetic diversity (Norena et al. 2018). This information is essential
not only for conservation and taxonomic studies but also for
bioprospecting novel compounds (Sekurova et al 2019) or for breeding
programs assisted by genetic markers (Assefa et al. 2019, Mrode
2019).
