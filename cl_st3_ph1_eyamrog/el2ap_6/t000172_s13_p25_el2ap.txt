STAT3 modulation plays an important role in pro- and anti-inflammatory
responses. As already mentioned, SARS-CoV PLpro activates TGF-β1 through p38MAPK/ERK1-2
pathway, promoting STAT3 activation (Li et al. 2016). MERS-CoV strains
with mutations in the NSP3 and ORF4a display differential STAT3
activation and different inflammatory cytokines profiles (Selinger et al. 2014).
In SARS-CoV infection it is observed a reduction of IL-4,
which participates in humoral protection, an increase of IFN- γ,
that participates in a potent cell-mediated immune response and also
the elevation of IL-10, that plays a part in disease
susceptibility (Zhu 2004).
