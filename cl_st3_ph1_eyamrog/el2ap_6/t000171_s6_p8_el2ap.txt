For Bergman A. et al. (2020) (20), the incidence rate,
as a function of time, reflects biological factors, including the
microorganism-host interaction, susceptible population size, contagiousness of the infection and
the rate of tests. Moreover, the incidence rate reflects the
organizational capacity and infrastructure of the health sector of a
territory. Therefore, richer regions would have more available testing resources,
which was confirmed in this study.
