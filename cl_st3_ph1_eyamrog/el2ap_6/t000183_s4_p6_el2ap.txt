It is also advisable, although there is normally time limitation,
to assess the level of reading comprehension students have in
their mother tongue so that teachers could provide them with
strategies that can be transferable into their foreign language learning.
Supporting this, (Cheryl 1994) stated that there is evidence of
reading skills transfer from one language into another. Since the
findings in this work suggested that there is very little
or maybe no use of graphic organizers in EFL classrooms
to develop reading skills and comprehension, it is suggested to
inform teachers about the benefits that can be obtained from
this proposal.
