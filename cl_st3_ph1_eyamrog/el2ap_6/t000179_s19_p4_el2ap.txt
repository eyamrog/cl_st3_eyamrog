KMO value was greater than 0.90, suggesting an adequate sample
size to perform the exploratory factor analysis. Parallel analysis identified
a two-dimensional model and Kaiser's analysis identified a three-dimensional model.
Consequently, two and three- dimensional models were evaluated (see table
2). In the model with two dimensions, the item “order
in the health service and labor organization” (variable c2p81_2 in
the dataset) presented factor complexity, since there was no marked
difference between factor loadings in the first and second dimensions.
That was why this item was removed from analysis. In
addition, the items on satisfaction about the hours or salary
received (c2p81_7), training opportunities (c2p81_10), filling out the medical records
(c2p81_15), and respect for the patient (c2p81_16) presented very low
factor loads so were also eliminated from subsequent analyses. On
the other hand, in the three-dimensional model we found that
the first dimension was unstable (very few items,) so this
model was also eliminated. Therefore, only the 2-dimensional model was
considered for further analysis, only after excluding the five problematic
items that were identified during this analysis (c2p81_2, c2p81_7, c2p81_10,
c2p81_15, and c2p81_16).
