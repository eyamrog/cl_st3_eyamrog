The response of the so-called innate immunity composed of macrophages,
lymphocytes (CD4+), and natural killers must be able to eliminate
the virus4. The key to the broad spectrum of different
impacts in border countries, as well as among individuals with
similar exposures, should be found in how the immune system
reacts to infection by SARS- CoV-2. To this end, understanding
the quality of the individual or collective innate response is
of paramount importance. For this purpose, the authors tried to
correlate the epidemic impact of different countries in three consecutive
months with their vaccine status of BCG (bacillus Calmette–Guérin), which
acts mainly by activating or training innate immunity5.
