Coronavirus ORF7a has been recognized as a type I IFN
antagonist only when in the presence of ORF3 protein, protecting
the virus from the antiviral state induced by this cytokine
(Dedeurwaerder et al. 2014). ORF7a protein also binds to BST-2
(Bone marrow stromal antigen 2 or tetherin), an antiviral protein
that restricts SARS-CoV infection, blocking its glycosylation, whereas the loss
of ORF7a leads to a much greater restriction (Taylor et
al. 2015). ORF7a expression has been also associated with cell
cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase in HEK 293 cells
via the cyclin D3/pRb pathway (Yuan et al. 2006). Another
study has found that the translation of SARS-CoV ORF7b may
be mediated by leaky scanning of ribosomes and that it
localizes in the Golgi compartment and is incorporated into viral
particles (Schaecher et al. 2007). Finally, a study has demonstrated
that SARS-CoV ORF8 may have originated through recombination from SARS-related
coronavirus from bats, which may have an impact on animal-to-human
transmission (Lau et al. 2015).
