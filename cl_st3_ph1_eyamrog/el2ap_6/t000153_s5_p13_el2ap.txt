“I know many feminist women who have forged bonds among
them to be able to get Misoprostol and help other
women get it, too. We ended up working together, because
the end of the process should be overseen by a
doctor, as the post-abortion care is really important. At the
beginning, I was alone, or at least I felt alone,
and I wasn’t sure of the way I could help
a woman to cater to her specific needs, because she
was a poor woman who was alone in this, etc.
And I started getting in contact with a feminist activist
I knew: she and her group were able to provide
help to women, when I couldn’t do anything else from
my position” (F. female, clinical doctor. Interview, Córdoba, October 2017).
When reporting about, and experiencing themselves, the provision of the
service, the members of the Network promote the idea of
“putting a face” to abortion, so as to counteract the
stereotypes and negative perceptions linked to this practice. Thus, abortion
is, for many of these professionals, a right to which
is worth being committed.
