In this study, departing from an ethological approach, we aim
to characterize Belminus genus taxonomically by identifying and observing behavioral
patterns elicited by sensory cues emanating from the cockroach host.
Given that Belminus are synanthropes and are involved in maintaining
the life cycle of T. cruzi, there is no doubt
about their eco-epidemiological relevance. But, there are phylogenetic concerns about
the fact that Belminus, as members of Triatominae, are not
strict bloodsuckers. Belminus species feed on blood, however they can
complete their life cycle by exclusively feeding on arthropod hemolymph.
Indeed, hemolymph is the primary source of food of Belminus
species when living in human adobes, as mentioned above. Thus,
hemaotophagia is not an obvious autapomorphy within Triatominae, which serves
as evidence against monophyly of this subfamily. The feeding behavior
that distinguishes Belminus would be a primitive habit among Reduviidae,
which suggests that Belminus are phylogenetically closer to their primitive
reduviid cousins, the assassin bugs, and more distant from bloodsucking
triatomines. However, this bit of evidence add to previous bits
of evidence, which according to Schaefer (2005) “point in so
many directions at once that, in fact, they point in
none and, so far, prove nothing”. In this work, instead
of focusing on the quality of triatomines’ meals (blood or
hemolymph) we focused on the natural history of their feeding
behavior. We looked for a behavioral pattern that can be
recognized as an autopomorphy, i.e. shared by Belminus and all
triatomine species.
