As illustrated in Figure 1, schools play at least four
roles that reflect their importance in the lives of children,
adolescents, family members, and to society as a whole. At
the heart of this context, especially when considering cognitive development,
education is driven by: socialization, through which children and adolescents
can develop their socio-emotional skills; care, that is being a
safe place where parents can leave their children to be
able to work; and, finally, through food, because in many
cases this is the only food meeting the nutritional standards
necessary for development and health that children and adolescents manage
to obtain. There is a complexity in fulfilling the objectives
of each of these school roles during this pandemic, which
has further challenged educators, governments, schools, and families.
