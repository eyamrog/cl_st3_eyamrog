To further analyze the cellular proteins related to coronaviruses biology,
we performed Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, using the list of proteins
presented in table 2. This allowed the generation of a
canonical pathways list, presented in table 3, that may be
important or modulated during the replication cycle of coronaviruses. The
top 10 pathways were selected based on their associated p-value.
The modulation of key molecular players, such as p53 and
mTOR pathways, the inhibition of the host immune response by
restraint of IFN induction and changes in cell cycle and
cell growth, has been highly associated with the proteins of
coronaviruses. These events may create a proliferative state that favors
viral replication and inhibits apoptosis, facilitating viral cycle progression.
