The use of waste odors to find resources is a
structural adaptation widespread in triatomines, given that the associated volatile
organic compounds are end-products derived from generally occurring metabolites of
vertebrate and invertebrate gut flora metabolism and, as such, do
not vary greatly between hosts (Ot치lora-Luna and Guerin 2014). These
compounds could play an important role in house invasion by
triatomine, as has been mentioned elsewhere (Ot치lora-Luna and Guerin 2014).
Belminus species could well make use of the same general
chemical cues they use to locate wild hosts for the
exploitation of synanthropic invertebrates (e.g., cockroaches) since similar odors occur
across invertebrates and vertebrates, thus plausibly explaining how these small
triatomines can readily switch to the domestic habitat (Ot치lora-Luna and
Guerin 2014, Ot치lora-Luna et al. 2016).
