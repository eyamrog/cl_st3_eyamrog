In viral RNA infections, the use of nutraceuticals has been
suggested to inhibit NOX2, which in turn, restores TLR7 response
to single-stranded viral RNA infection and induces IFN; nutraceuticals could
also up-regulate mitochondrial antiviral-signaling proteins (MAVS) and reduce pro-inflammatory signaling
(McCarty and DiNicolantonio 2020). Besides nutraceuticals, Vitamins A and D,
Selenium, Zinc, and probiotics may be beneficial for COVID-19 patients,
by enhancing immunity and preventing respiratory infections (Grant et al.
2020; Jayawardena et al. 2020). Thus, the nutritional status of
COVID-19 patients may be of further interest in future therapies
since it might have an impact on disease development.
