Metformin and rapamycin are known modulators of viral infection and
translation control pathways, such as mTOR. It is reported for
example that in the 1971 influenza outbreak, diabetic patients treated
with phenformin and buformin presented a lower incidence of infection
compared to diabetics treated with sulfonylureas or insulin (Lehrer 2020).
The immunoregulation of COVID-19 with mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin
has been recently proposed (Zheng et al. 2020).
