Zhang and colleagues (49) investigated conditions related to the mental
health of children with ADHD during the COVID-19 outbreak. During
the outbreak of COVID- 19, ADHD symptoms in children were
significantly worse compared to normal. These findings alerted the importance
of focusing on special vulnerable groups during the outbreak. Attention
is needed to identify an appropriate approach for children with
ADHD in terms of disaster risk reduction activities.
