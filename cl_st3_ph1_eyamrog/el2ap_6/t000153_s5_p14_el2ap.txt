“When I was doing the practicum during my specialization stage,
we went to the hospital and I watched how a
doctor treated a woman through her delivery of her baby.
I ended up in shock at the way that woman
was treated; I couldn’t do anything, I was a student,
but I think that I decided then not to take
up obstetrics. However, I eventually ended up offering the abortion
service because it is a way of fighting so much
injustice. To me, medicine is useful to do a little
bit of justice to women who are so ill-treated in
the health systems” (L. female, clinical doctor. Interviews, Córdoba, November
2018).
