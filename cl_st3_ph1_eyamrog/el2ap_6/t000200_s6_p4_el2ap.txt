The current research stratified by Health Regions, upon taking into
account the heterogeneity in the distribution of rainfall in Santa
Catarina, brings important information under the focus of the geography
of leptospirosis in the state. The Northeast, the Far West,
Médio Vale do Itajaí, Grande Florianópolis, and Foz do Rio
Itajaí accounted for more than three-quarters of the cases. The
Northeast region alone was responsible for almost 30%.
