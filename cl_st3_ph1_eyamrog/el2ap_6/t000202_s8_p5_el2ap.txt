Regarding territorial studies developed in university contexts, we need to
highlight the significant contributions made in Mexico by Rosas (2002),
also in Flores et al. (2009), Bañales (2014) and, to
a lesser extent, studies that have been made on university
population in Chile by Güell, Morales and Nuñez (2011); Colombia
by Arango, Castañeda and Ramírez (2016); and Cuba by Gómez,
Riverón, Griñan, León and Yarenis (2017) among others.
