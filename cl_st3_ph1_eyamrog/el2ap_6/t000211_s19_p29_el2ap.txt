The Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Section of the Heart Institute
of Minneapolis, following the recommendations of the American College of
Surgeons15 for COVID in elective procedures, instituted drastic changes in
its clinical practice. The unit chose to postpone all elective
procedures but those considered essential, whose absence could in some
way threaten patientsâ€™ life or limbs integrity. To ensure that
postponed procedures are not forgotten, a database was developed so
that rescheduling can be carried out later. Most outpatient visits
were converted to telephone visits, limiting the review of medical
records and imaging exam to protect the clinical staff16.
