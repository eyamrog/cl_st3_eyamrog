At the Ilha do Cardoso island, there are already studies
about the diversity of fungi from the following phyla: Basidiomycota
(Bononi 1979a,b,c, 1984, Bononi et al. 1984, Bononi & Capelari
1984, Capelari 1989, Gugliotta & Capelari 1995, Gugliotta & Bononi
1999), Glomeromycota (Trufem et al. 1989, Trufem et al. 1994)
and more recently, Chytridiomycota and Blastocladiomycota (Jerônimo 2014, Jerônimo et
al. 2015). However, until now, there are no records about
aquatic anamorphic fungi, being the improvement of the knowledge concerning
its diversity, the main aim of the present study. The
data of the measurements of some abiotic parameters are also
presented for historical documentation about the island.
