Reynolds et al. (11) reported that during social isolation a
constellation of psychopathological symptoms may appear, such as depressed mood,
irritability, anxiety, fear, anger, insomnia, among others, remaining long-term consequences
for mental health. Hawryluck et al. (12) reported that even
three years after a period of isolation, there was still
a greater risk for alcohol abuse, symptoms of post-traumatic stress
disorder and depression.
