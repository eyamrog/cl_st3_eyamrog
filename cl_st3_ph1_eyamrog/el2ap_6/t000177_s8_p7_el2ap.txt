The use of face masks has become ubiquitous in the
world. The Disposable N95 respirators and medical masks are both
worn by for healthcare workers self-protection. However, these masks have
different intended uses. N95 respirators are designed to prevent the
wearer from inhaling small airborne particles. Thus, they must meet
filtration requirements, and fit tightly to the wearerâ€™s face, limiting
facial seal leakage. Medical masks are intended to prevent microorganism
transmission from the wearer to the patient. Medical masks fit
the face loosely and do not reliably prevent inhalation of
small airborne particles [10].
