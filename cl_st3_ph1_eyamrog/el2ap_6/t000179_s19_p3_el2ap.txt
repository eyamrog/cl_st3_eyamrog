Health Services Management Satisfaction Scale KMO value was greater than
0.90, suggesting a good proportion of variance among variables that
might be common variance. Parallel analysis identified three possible dimensions
and Kaiser's analysis identified two dimensions. Due to the heterogeneity,
one, two and three-dimensions models were evaluated. The one-dimensional and
two- dimensional models presented adequate factor loads for physicians (Î»>0.4)
and met the condition of having at least three items
in each dimension (see Table 2). On the other hand,
the structure of the three-dimensional model was very heterogeneous. Its
dimensions were not stable since they had very few items
(less than three items per dimension). Therefore, this model was
not considered in subsequent analyzes.
