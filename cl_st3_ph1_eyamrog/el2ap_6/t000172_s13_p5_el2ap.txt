1) The RTC, after binding to the 3’ anti-leader sequence
of the viral genome, initiates the synthesis of negative RNA
throughout the molecule until it finds the leader region in
the 5’ end, generating a complete copy of negative polarity
of the genome, called antigenome. This antigenome will serve as
a template for the synthesis of the genome (+) (figure
2, processes 1a and 1b).
