Throughout the pandemic, there was a strong collaboration between the
main Dentistry regulatory bodies such as the Australian Dental Association
(ADA), the Dental Board of Australia (DBA) and the Australian
Council of Dental Schools (ACODS). A staged level of severity
of restrictions was implemented by the ADA and endorsed by
the other entities and supported by State and Federal Governments
[19]. The restrictions ranged from level 1 to level 5,
and staid on level 3 for March and April. This
meant that only dental emergencies could be treated including management
of infections, pain, and bleeding, without the use of aerosols
(Table 1). During this time, the School created a minimal
roster with clinical dentists and academics only, without students. From
late-April, the government approved a reduction to ADA level 2,
and finally, at the end of May, it went down
to level 1. Although these rules apply to all dentists
in the country, the Dental schools have just recently initiated
their “return to clinic” strategy, and most are starting at
level 2 restrictions [20].
