In line with recent studies that revealed the high risk
of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to develop thromboembolic events, the
Departments of Angiology and Vascular Surgery of hospitals around the
world were challenged due to the massive requirement for computed
tomography (CT) scans and echo-color- Doppler (ECD) for the diagnosis
of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), respectively,
in these patients. Review the evidence for the diagnosis and
treatment of VTE has become essential, as well as adapting
clinical algorithms and flowcharts for use during the current world
scenario. In addition, therapy recommendations for these patients is another
critical point that must be approached with care, as the
use of anticoagulants in patients who require invasive ventilation creates
a potential bleeding risk. Therefore, the risk-benefit must always be
reassessed during the clinical course.
