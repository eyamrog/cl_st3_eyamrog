From the professionalsâ€™ point of view, one of the reasons
leading to the establishment of the Network was the need
to rethink the role played by healthcare providers to meet
the demand made by women with unplanned pregnancies. Therefore, their
lack of specific training during the pre-professional stage became evident:
this would be training that would allow them to offer
assistance, from their position within the public health system, to
women and girls in an abortion situation. The workers showed
a disposition to offer solutions but had little knowledge on
the available tools (medical abortion) nor did they know about
the normative and legal advances regarding abortion provision (Drovetta 2015a,
2015b). Among these, the following stand out: Action Protocols in
the Guide for the Improvement of Post Abortion Care (2005),
Guide for Non-Punishable Abortion Integral Care (2010), and Protocol for
Integral Care of People with the Right to a Legal
Interruption of Pregnancy in Argentina (2015), all of them produced
by the Ministry of Health of Argentina.
