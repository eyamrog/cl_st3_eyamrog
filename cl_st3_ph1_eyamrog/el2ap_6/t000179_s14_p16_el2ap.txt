A random subset from the total sample (split-half method) (20,
21) was analyzed. Polychoric matrices were used (22) and the
estimator was weighted using least squares means and variance adjusted
(WLSMV) (23), since it best fitted the ordinal nature of
our items. We used quartimin rotation, parallel analysis test and
Kaiser analysis to evaluate the most appropriate number of dimensions
(24). Different models were obtained and evaluated to identify the
one with the best measurement properties. This decision was made
since theoretical models suggest that job satisfaction is a multidimensional
construct. Before performing exploratory factorial analysis, the value of the
Kaiser- Meyer-Olkin (KMO) was estimated. This is an index of
sample adequacy, which allows identifying whether there is enough power
or sample size to perform the analysis. Adequate KMO values
higher than 0.90 are adequate (22).
