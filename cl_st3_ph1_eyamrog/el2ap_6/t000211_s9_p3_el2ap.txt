Laboratory changes such as lymphopenia, neutrophilia, increased prothrombin time and
elevated D-dimer (DD) are found in patients who have an
unfavorable course of the disease3. In addition, the study by
Zhou et al.4 with 191 patients from Jinyintan Hospitals and
the Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital proposed that advanced age, higher SOFA
score and DD greater than 1 Î¼g/mL at admission were
associated with a higher risk of death; approximately 90% of
hospitalized patients with pneumonia also displayed hypercoagulability4. The same study
also stated that the possible contributory mechanisms for the systemic
changes found in such patients include: (1) the formation of
pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are mediators of atherosclerosis, contributing directly to
the rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque by local inflammation, (2)
induction of pro- coagulant factors, and (3) hemodynamic changes that
predispose to ischemia and thrombosis.
