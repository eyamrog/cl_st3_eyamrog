Data were organized in Microsoft Excel (Windows version 2016, Microsoft
Corporation; Redmond, WA, USA) and incorporated into Microcal Origin software
version 6.0. The Boltzmann function8-10,12 was applied to the data
simulation for each set of data regarding different geographical regions
in the northeast of Brazil. We obtained the parameters of
each function, with the potential total number of confirmed cases
being directly given by the parameter A2. The Boltzmann function
for future simulation is expressed as follows: <>, where C(x)
is the cumulative number of confirmed cases after the first
day x; A1, A2, x0, and dx are constants. X0
corresponds to the inflection point and indicates the date on
which the daily cases will reach their maximum. After that
date, there will be a downward trend in total daily
cases; dx is the adjustment coefficient, indicating the degree of
increase in y (number of COVID-19 deaths) as a function
of the increase in x (days after the first case);
A2 represents the estimated potential total number of deaths.16 Data
from parameter A2 was used to calculate the rate of
cumulative COVID-19 deaths per 1,000,000 inhabitants.
