During the search stages, investigations involving analysis of iron, zinc,
and folate did not meet the necessary criteria for inclusion
in this study, thus the results were limited to findings
corresponding to vitamin A and D, showing that the deficiency
of these nutrients appears to be a predictor of clinical
complications in the course of the assessed respiratory infections.
