Abiotic factors - The water temperature followed the climatic conditions
(table 1). The values of water temperature during the samplings
are comparable to other studies in the Atlantic rainforest biome.
Schoenlein-Crusius et al. (2009) cited temperatures between 20 °C to
26 °C in the Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga
(PEFI), State of São Paulo. Nascimento (2007) pointed out temperatures
around 14.3 °C to 21.6 °C in the Parque Estadual
da Serra da Cantareira, also in the State of São
Paulo. These values are considered as ideal for the occurrence
of aquatic Hyphomycetes, which are described as having an optimum
temperature for growth between 15 ºC to 25 ºC (Ingold
1975).
