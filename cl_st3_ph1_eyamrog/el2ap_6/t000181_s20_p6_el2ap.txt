Table 2 shows gender frequency scores of the Peritraumatic Distress
Scale (CPDI) and the Fear Scale (FCV-19S). In both scales,
women’s mean scores are higher; women’s CPDI frequency scores are
predominantly on the mild and severe distress frequency levels (47.3%
and 27.2%) while men rely on normal and mild levels
(41.6% and 48.4%). Similarly, most women's FCV-19S frequency scores are
at a mild level (44.5%), while men’s scores are at
a normal level (68.8%). Still, women's scores are higher (15.4%)
than men (4.8%) at a severe level.
