Based on Table 1, it is possible to build a
rough profile of the participants: single (48.7%) woman (79.8%), with
an average of 36.2 years of age, with up to
one child (75.7%), with a college degree (complete or incomplete
89.7%), working (69.5%) with health insurance (69.4%) and in social
isolation during the pandemic (87.0%). The profile is psychologically significant
because, although men and women are similar in many ways,
it matches the biological, behavioral, and cognitive differences between genders
that influence the health care approach in terms of manifestation,
epidemiology, and pathophysiology widespread diseases (Regitz-Zagrosek, 2012).
