I. quadricellularia is concomitantly cited for two completely different biomes
in Brazil: the Atlantic Rain Forest of Ilha do Cardoso
in the southeast State of São Paulo (this paper) and
in the Caatinga region of the northeast state of Bahia
(Fiuza & Gusmão 2014). The geographical distribution of these taxa
seems to be broader than first supposed. It is the
first record of the species for São Paulo State.
