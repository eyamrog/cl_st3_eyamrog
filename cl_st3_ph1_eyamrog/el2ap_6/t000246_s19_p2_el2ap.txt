We define authorship or contribution as the instance of a
researcher as author or co- author of a published article.
We follow a complete count, unlike Lotka, who credited only
senior or first authors, where each co-author is credited with
a complete contribution, regardless of the number of authors. To
identify authors and ensure a proper count, a process of
disambiguation of names was based on the affiliation of the
authors.
