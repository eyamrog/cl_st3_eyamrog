The distribution of cases of leptospirosis and the rainfall indexes
were first obtained in accordance with each one of the
Health Regions. For each of the 16 regions, the following
data are presented: the number of leptospirosis cases, the average
rates of the disease and their rainfall indexes, the proportional
contribution of cases and their rainfall indexes, and the ratios
of cases per unit of rainfall. In order to estimate
the relative excess in the incidence of diagnosis, upon comparing
the 16 regions, ratios of monthly leptospirosis rates were calculated,
taking as a reference the month with the lowest rate
in the period (Serrana). The probability of leptospirosis occurrence when
comparing each of the regions with that of reference is
represented by the relative risk (RR).
