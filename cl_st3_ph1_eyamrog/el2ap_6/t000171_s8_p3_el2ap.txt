Up to August 3, 2020, 17,918,582 cases were confirmed worldwide,
and 686,703 thousand deaths (4). In most countries, the confirmation
of cases increases exponentially, especially during the initial stages of
the outbreak (3). Although it is difficult to compare fatal
case rates between the countries, as they are at different
stages of the outbreak, the variations are probably related to
the scope of population tests, age structure, health status of
population and health systems of each country (3). In Brazil,
the first confirmed case was reported in the state of
SÃ£o Paulo on February 26, 2020 (2). To the current
date, August 4, 2020, 2,753,925 cases and 94,746 deaths are
attributed to COVID-19 in the country (5).
