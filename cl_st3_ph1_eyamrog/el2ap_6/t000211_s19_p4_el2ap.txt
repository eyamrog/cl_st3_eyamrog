The study did not recommend the use of ECD to
exclude the diagnosis of PE due to its low accuracy.
Negative DD associated with a low modified Wells score were
considered sufficient to rule out the diagnosis. However, in the
context of Sars-Cov-2 infection, which leads to an increase in
DD values, its usefulness becomes compromised, which does not mean
that its values should be ignored.
