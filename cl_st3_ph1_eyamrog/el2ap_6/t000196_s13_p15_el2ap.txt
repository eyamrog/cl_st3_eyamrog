For example, school closures in situations similar to the current
pandemic were used during the H1N1 outbreak as a non-pharmaceutical
containment measure [17], which, according to these authors, contributed to
a decrease in the spread of the disease. However, in
Brazil in 2009, only a few states postponed returning to
classes by 15 days in the second semester of the
academic year [18], with no extended school closures as in
2020.
