The sample amounted to 438 students, and its selection responded
to the distribution by gender in the total enrollment of
the university, 63% female 37% male. The groups corresponded to
the five undergraduate courses and the subgroups of the different
cycles: Basic Education (six cycles), Intercultural Bilingual Education (six cycles),
Initial Education (six cycles), Special Education (four cycles) and Education
in Experimental Sciences (two cycles). Each degree presents a different
amount of population; therefore, the selected sample responded to that
characteristic. In Basic Education, 234 students were selected, in Initial
Education 78, in Intercultural Bilingual Education 50, in Special Education
53 and Experimental Sciences 26.
