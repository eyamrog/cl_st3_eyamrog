Throughout this work, we intended to characterize, in general terms,
the practices adopted by members of the “Network of Healthcare
Professionals for the Right to Decide.” Our study sought to
inquire about, from the very perspective adopted by the professionals,
the main changes they have experienced regarding the perception of
the stigma of abortion since they joined the organization.
