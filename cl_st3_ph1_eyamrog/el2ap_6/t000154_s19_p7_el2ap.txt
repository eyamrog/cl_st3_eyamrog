Support for open peer review varied with the stakeholder group
participants belonged to. Readers and SBMFC members seem to be
more supportive (than authors and reviewers) of open peer review
in general (Table 2) and trait by trait (Table 3),
as well as when considering more specific statements (Table 4).
