Sequencing projects will definitely rise in the next months and
years. It would not be a surprise, for instance, to
see a rise of SARS-CoV2 genomes submitted by Peruvian institutions.
In order to effectively track this information and keep it
updated we encourage Peruvian institutions to create a unified online
platform to frequently survey and organize sequencing data.
