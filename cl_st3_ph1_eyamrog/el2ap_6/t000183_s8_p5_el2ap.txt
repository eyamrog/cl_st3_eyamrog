Spratt, Pulverness and Williams, have emphasized the characteristics of reading
as a receptive skill, which means that this activity involves
reacting to a text rather than creating one (Spratt, Pulverness
& Williams 2005:21-26). Reading comprehension is a complex cognitive process
of decoding symbols to obtain meaning. It comprises the comprehension
of a text at a word level, and at a
sentence and paragraph level, as well. In order to help
learners, teachers must have a clear understanding of the complexity
of reading and try to find ways to ease such
a complex process. Years ago, UNESCO pointed out that third
grade students from some Latin American countries, including Ecuador, are
not able to recognize important information in simple texts in
Spanish (LÃ³pez 2009:1-3). Again, the information is confirmed in 2016
when third graders from schools in Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Dominican
Republic, among others, still showed low performance in reading, not
being able to identify key information unless explicitly stated and
highlighted in a text.
