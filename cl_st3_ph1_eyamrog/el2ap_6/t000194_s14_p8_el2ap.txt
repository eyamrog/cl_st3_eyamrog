The steps of the conidial production were followed and morphological
relevant features were searched to identify the taxa by specific
identification keys (Ingold 1975, Marvanová 1997, Santos-Flores & Betancourt-López 1997).
For documentation and ex- situ preservation purposes, slides were also
prepared with PVLG (polyvinyl alcohol lactoglycerol) resin, deposited at the
Herbarium Maria Eneida Kaufmann Fidalgo in the Instituto de Botânica,
in municipality of São Paulo, São Paulo State, Brazil. Digital
images were obtained with the aid of an optical microscope
Leica DM LB2, equipped with a Leica DFRC 280 digital
camera.
