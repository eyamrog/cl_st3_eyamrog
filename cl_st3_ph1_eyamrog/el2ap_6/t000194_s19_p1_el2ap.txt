Abiotic factors - The water temperature was about 18 oC
in August/2012 and 23 ºC in February/2013 in all sites
(table 1). Regarding the pH of the water, the values
varied from 5.58 to 8.75 at the Cachoeira do Perequê,
and from 5.26 to 6.64 at the Rio Perequê. In
the water of the Córrego the pH values varied from
5.48 to 7.12 and at the Poço das Antas the
values varied from 6.14 to 6.28. The only measurement of
the pH of Rio Cor de Chá, revealed a very
low value, corresponding to 3.84, and a conductivity value of
0.394 S.cm-1. Dissolved oxygen values remained constant among the collection
sites: from 8.75 to 10.01 mgO2/L at Perequê waterfall; 6.73
to 8.90 mgO2/L at Perequê river; 6.50 to 7.82 mgO2/L
at Córrego; 7.50 a 10.45 mgO2/L at Poço das Antas.
Only one measurement was performed at Cor de Chá river,
resulting in 10.17 mgO2/L.
