Without school feeding programs during the COVID-19 pandemic, thousands of
children are subject to starvation. As of April, regarding strategies
for the provision of school meals during this pandemic, of
the approximately 197 countries with schools closed during this period,
10 of them have implemented programs for the transfer of
cash rations to families, 47 are providing take-home food rations,
9 have placed programs on hold, and 16 are adopting
mixed strategies [1]. However, the provision of food or other
assistance to supply school meals does not guarantee that children
are, in fact, being fed. [4].
