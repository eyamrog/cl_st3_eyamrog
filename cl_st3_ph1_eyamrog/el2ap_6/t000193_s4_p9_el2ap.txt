In the future, case series of MS/NMOSD patients infected with
COVID-19 will help us define the best management strategies. For
the time being, we rely on expert experience and counsel.
Following the example of other centers73, we share our current
strategies for patient care during the pandemic, hoping they will
aid clinicians in our country.
