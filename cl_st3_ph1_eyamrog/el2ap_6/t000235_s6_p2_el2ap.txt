Further, our case tested positive for lupus anticoagulant. Zhang et
al.11 recently reported three COVID-19 cases with presence of thrombotic
phenomena (multiple cerebral infarctions) and antiphospholipid antibodies. However, the cases
were negative for lupus anticoagulant, but positive for anti-cardiolipin IgA
and anti–β 2-glycoprotein-I IgA and IgG antibodies.
