Initially, we merged the data according to the Brazilian Institute
of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) code for the municipalities and
prepared the descriptive statistical analyzes as follows: cities that exhibited
more than two standard deviations from the mean in the
distribution of rapid tests (>12.58) and RT-PCR tests (>4.84) were
excluded due to the noise of these outliers in the
general data, thus resulting in the exclusion of 23 cities
for rapid tests and 28 for molecular tests. Then, mean,
median and quartiles for city distributions according to the type
of test were generated.
