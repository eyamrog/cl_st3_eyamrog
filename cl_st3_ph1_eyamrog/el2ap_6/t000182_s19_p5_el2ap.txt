Eventually, after 1 hour, all individuals from the three species
ended up approaching the box (100%, P<0.001), and remained 0.5-3
cm close, but the odors or vibrations induced by the
captive cockroach prevented the bugs from contacting the box. Bugs
made explorative approaches to the box, by touching it with
antennae and brief walks, but eventually desisted from climbing. The
FAP or proboscis extension were not observed in this arena,
only chemotaxis was observed.
