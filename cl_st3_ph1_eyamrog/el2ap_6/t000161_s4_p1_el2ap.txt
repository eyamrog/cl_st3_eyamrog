Menaces to taxonomy as a science come from distinct sources
and the low bibliometric values of its journals is only
one factor that contributes for establishing the so-called taxonomic impediment.
Clarivate is a for-profit company, but Magnolia Press Ltd. and
other similar publishers are also not examples of nonprofit NGOs.
The reversion of the suppression of Zootaxa by Clarivate is
irrelevant to biological sciences and taxonomy because Journal Impact Factors
are statistically illiterate (Curry 2012) and cause a great deal
of harm to science. This reinstatement should certainly not be
regarded by taxonomists as a victory for the field. As
a community we should not endorse the villainy of bibliometric
policies that bring more harm than benefit to our field.
