Chart 1 (Appendix 1) presents data on the benefits related
to school meals provided by each of the Brazilian states
and the Federal District to the families of students during
the cessation of classes due to the pandemic, and available
on the websites of the 27 State Departments of Education
of each federated entity (retrieved between June 6 and June
8, 2020). We sought to identify the number of families
and students receiving some type of benefit, the value and
type of the benefit transferred, the form of transfer or
delivery, and the eligibility criteria for such procedure.
