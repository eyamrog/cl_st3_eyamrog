Providing food is one of the functions performed by a
school, in addition to others, such as education, socialization, and
care for children and adolescents [5]. Maintaining a healthy diet
is crucial for preserving the general well-being of a population.
A good nutritional status is directly related to proper development
and growth in childhood, better immune response, less risk of
developing diseases, and is fundamental for recovery, in cases of
infection [6,7].
