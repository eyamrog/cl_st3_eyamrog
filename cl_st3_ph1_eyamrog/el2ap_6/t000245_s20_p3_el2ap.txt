Notes: the species is characterized by the sessile basidiome, lacquer
layer, reddish color, and 6-8 pores per mm. A. multiplicatum
is morphologically similar to G. orbiforme (Fr.) Ryvarden, however, differences
can be observed through the analysis of microscopic characters, and
G. orbiforme has larger basidiospores (8.8-10.4 × 6.4 -7.2 μm)
and cuticle cells with more developed protuberances (Gugliotta et al.
2011). This is a new record for the State of
Goiás.
