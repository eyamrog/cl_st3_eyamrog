As authors of papers on distinct zoological taxa, editors of
special issues, and reviewers of manuscripts submitted to Zootaxa along
the last ten years, we feel comfortable to offer an
opinion on the journal and its impact in the taxonomic
world, an actual phenomenon that transformed it into the leading
vehicle for making new zoological names available.
