Some limitations must be considered when interpreting the presented data,
such as the inclusion of observational studies, interfering in some
causality relationships; the heterogeneity of the selected studies made it
impossible to calculate a summary measure (meta-analysis), however, the use
of strategies such as checking the quality of articles can
help to control this bias; and the absence of original
studies with a nutritional approach in patients with COVID-19 restricted
inferential aspects.
