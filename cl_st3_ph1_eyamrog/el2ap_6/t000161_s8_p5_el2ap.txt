Our goal is to discuss the following questions. Can the
suppression of any journal from JIF really affect the production
in the taxonomic field? What are the consequences of Zootaxa
suppression to taxonomy as a science? What means self-citation? What
is the average JIF for taxonomic journals? Is Zootaxa a
victim of its success? So, what is actually going on?
To properly address these aspects, we first need to clarify
a few concepts and dig further into the current situation
of taxonomic journals, impact measures of scientific publications, and the
role of individuals and mega-corporations in this arena.
