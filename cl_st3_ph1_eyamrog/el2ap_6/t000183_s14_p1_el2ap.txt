One of the investigators of this study is currently working
at Unidad Educativa Joaquin Lalama and obtained the permission from
its authorities to carry out this research, trying to find
a way to help students improve their reading comprehension in
English. Consequently, the groups assigned to the researcher in the
academic period 2018-2019, before and after intervention, were observed. Barreiro
and Albandoz (2001) have defined population as the total amount
of individuals studied in a problem. Since the total number
of students in this research was less than 100, the
population and sample will be considered as one, making up
a control group of 40 students, and an experimental group
of 35.
