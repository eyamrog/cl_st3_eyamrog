Arena 2: Orientation responses of B. corredori, B. ferroae and
B. herreri to an odorous still air were tested in
a square glass arena (29 x 29 cm). A living
fifth instar B. giganteus was confined in an opaque-black cardboard
box (length 6.5, wide 8 cm, height 2.5), placed in
the center of a side (Fig 1B). The side of
the box facing the center of the arena had 12
holes (dia. 2 mm). A similar empty box was placed
as a control at the other end. Each bug was
placed in a central 3 cm circle. The bug, initially
covered with a circular Petri dish (2.8 cm), was released
after 2 min of adaptation. We noted which half of
the arena the insect preferred during a 5 minute period.
A bug was considered attracted to cockroach volatiles if it
preferred the half of the arena where the cockroach was
present. In a secondary phase of the bioassay, the position
of the bug was noted after one hour of starting
each experiment. A bug was considered attracted if it ended
next to the box where the cockroach was present, i.e.
no more than 3 cm far from the box. As
some Belminus individuals may be reluctant to move for long
periods (sometimes hours) after being manipulated, insects that did not
leave the circle after five minutes were discarded (23%). Stimuli
positions were interchanged every 2 insects; the arena was cleaned
before making such changes. In order to test for asymmetries
in the experimental setup Belminus bugs were observed in an
odorless control trial, where two empty boxes were placed in
the arena. Each experiment was repeated 20 times.
