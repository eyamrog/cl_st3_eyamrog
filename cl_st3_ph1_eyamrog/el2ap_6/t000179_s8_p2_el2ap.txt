Assessing of physician´s job satisfaction in low- and middle-income countries
is urgently required, since they struggle more often with complex
labor dynamics like limited financial compensation, lack of opportunities for
career development, workload and poor legal safety compared to their
peers who work in high-income developed countries (7). In many
developing countries, job dissatisfaction may lead to the migration of
health workers overseas, causing specialists shortages (8-10). Although assessing the
satisfaction of physicians in their workplaces is highly relevant, their
measurement constitutes a great challenge. It needs the evaluation of
various factors and dimensions of the working environment, which go
far beyond the physician´s knowledge and experience. There is evidence
that job satisfaction is associated with the doctor-patient relationship, workload,
relationship with colleagues, financial conditions, and autonomy in clinical decision-making
(11, 12). It should be noted that many of these
factors associated with job satisfaction are modifiable, which brings the
attention to the development of adequate measurement tools in such
complex scenarios. Particularly, there are many scales for assessing job
satisfaction, but many of these instruments have not been adapted
to low- and medium-income contexts, let alone considering the peculiarities
of each of these healthcare systems (12, 13). Thus, it
is necessary to have instruments that are contextualized to the
characteristics of each healthcare system to prevent the risk of
measurement biases.
