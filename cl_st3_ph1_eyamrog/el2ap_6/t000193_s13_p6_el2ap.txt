While intravenous steroids are the mainstay treatment approach for MS
relapses, studies have shown that relapse treatment with oral steroids
can be similarly effective17,18. As oral corticosteroids can be administered
without breaking social distancing, we believe this practice should be
considered as a treatment strategy during the pandemic. We propose
treating relapses with custom-made oral methylprednisolone tablets at 1000 mg
per day for five days. If oral tablets are unavailable
(a common situation in Brazil), we recommend the use of
intravenous methylprednisolone (1000 mg) for five days, preferably in a
day hospital regimen. In the case of contraindications to high-dose
steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (total dose of 2 g/kg administered for
2â€“5 days) is reasonable19.
