Although until now the effects of COVID-19 on mental health
have not been studied systematically, it is expected to produce
significant effects due to public reactions already observed (40). Observing
this reaction and in previous experiences, the National Health Commission
of China has taken important steps and issued a notification
stipulating guidelines for emergency interventions in cases of psychosocial disasters,
in order to reduce the psychosocial impacts of the COVID-19
outbreak, with teams composed of psychiatrists, mental health professionals and
psychological support hotlines (41). According to these concerns, the Department
of Mental Health and Psychoactive Substances of the World Health
Organisation (2) has published a document with recommendations aimed at
mental health and psychosocial well-being by placing psychiatrists and psychologists
to assist other health professionals, patients and the general public
to understand the possible effect of COVID-19 and help their
patients, families and the general public.
