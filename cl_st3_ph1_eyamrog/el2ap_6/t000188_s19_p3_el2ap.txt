For Boltzmann data analysis, each region was well-fitted and all
R2 values were close to 0.999 (from March 17 to
May 15, 2020) (Table 1). The potential total numbers of
COVID-19 deaths in Brazil for the next 60 days after
May 15 were estimated and the results and are shown
in Table 1. The potential number of cumulative COVID-19 deaths
per 1,000,000 inhabitants until June 15, 2020 will be higher
for Roraima (881.98), Rio de Janeiro (761.45), Amazonas (665.56) Pará
(559.62) and Pernambuco (316.87), and lower for Mato Grosso do
Sul (6.32), Minas Gerais (12.07), Paraná (12.18), Rio Grande do
Sul (18.24) and Santa Catarina (19.86).
