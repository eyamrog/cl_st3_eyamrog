Belminus species were not attracted to volatiles emitted by cockroaches
in the Y-olfactometer, and indeed the three species B. corredori,
B. ferroae and B. herreri avoided this odor. This result
was surprising as the three Belminus bugs tested in this
study have lived exclusively off cockroach hemolymph. The cockroaches acted
stressed, i.e. exhibiting compulsive movements, in the olfactometer flask probably
due to the negative pressure produced by the air flow.
Possibly, they were producing allomones (i.e., defensive volatile secretions) during
the experiments (Schal 1992), which might explain the avoidance behaviors
observed here. Mouse’s wastes were also avoided by B. corredori
and B. ferroae. Avoidance of mice feces might be due
to potential predation by this vertebrate. However, both species were
attracted to volatiles emanating from cockroach feces. Sandoval et al.
(2004, 2010, 2013) demonstrated that Belminus species are much better
adapted to cockroaches than to mice. These authors found domestic
Belminus species closely living in, and feeding on, cockroaches in
human houses. In nature, sylvatic Belminus are probably associated with
insect-hosts living under rocks or in tree barks, or are
associated with invertebrates living inside vertebrate refuges such as caves,
borrows, nests, etc. Our result confirmed the hypothesis proposed previously
by Otálora-Luna and Guerin (2014) –volatiles from host wastes (i.e.
cockroach feces) emanating from host refuges stimulate triatomines searching behavior.
