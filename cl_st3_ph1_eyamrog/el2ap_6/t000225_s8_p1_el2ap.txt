Social Distancing Strategies (SDS) are known tools used for controlling
the spread of pan­ demics and are being used for
the current COVID-19 pandemic1. China2, Italy3, Spain, and several European
countries4, New York State5 and others have been using SDS
successfully. In this article, we analyze indicators that demonstrate that
the SDS adopted in São Paulo State, Brazil, since March
16th has provided clear results that saved lives and protected
the health system of the state from being overloaded due
to the progression of the epidemic. Data from the end
of April, however, shows that the number of cases tends
to increase as the adherence to SDS by the population
decreases.
