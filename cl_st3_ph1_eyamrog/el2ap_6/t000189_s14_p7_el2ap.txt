The articles screening followed three stages: reading the title, reading
the abstract, and reading full-text articles. After reading the titles
and abstracts, the full texts were read to identify those
who met the inclusion criteria, according to the pre-established protocol.
The authors independently evaluated the articles and, later, they were
gathered for confrontation and confirmation of the investigated data to
reduce bias and heterogeneity in the analyzes.
