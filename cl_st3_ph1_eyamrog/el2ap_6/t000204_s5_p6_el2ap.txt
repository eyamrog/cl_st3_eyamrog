In times of COVID-19, besides the preservation of life, one
of the challenges is, therefore, the behavioural reorganisation, that is,
habits that, in the educational context, must contemplate a scientific
perspective, seeking to transform the consequences of the pandemic into
opportunities. In this sense, neurosciences present neuroplasticity as the maximum
law (43), a property that can prepare educators and students
for confrontations and conflicts triggered during and after the COVID-19
pandemic. Moreover, through the adverse conditions that are being exposed,
the development and prevalence of abilities and skills demand the
need to build autonomy for the conduct of studies, based
on the fact that teaching-learning is a dialectical process in
which, for example, memory losses can be confused with attention
losses, and vice-versa (78).
