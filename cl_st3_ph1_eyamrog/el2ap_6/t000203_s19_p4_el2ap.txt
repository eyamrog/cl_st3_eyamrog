The main comparisons between countries in the groups 2.1 and
2.2 or 3.1 and 3.2 support the central hypothesis of
this work, generating higher incidence, mortality, and lethality ratios in
countries without vaccination programs. When comparing groups 1.1 and 1.2
(Table 3), for example, the incidence ratio indicates that the
incidence in group 1.1 is 6.762 times higher than in
group 1.2. Also, mortality and lethality are 7.354 and 1.088
times higher in group 1.1 than in group 1.2, respectively.
It can be seen that there was no difference between
acceleration/inhabitants in this comparison.
