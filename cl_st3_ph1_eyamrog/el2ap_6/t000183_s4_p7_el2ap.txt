The effectiveness of graphic organizers for improving reading comprehension in
the EFL classrooms has been proven. They provide students with
visual tools such as images, which expand the development of
linguistic data or logogens in such a way, that the
information is dually coded: visually and linguistically. This helps students
process and remember content.
