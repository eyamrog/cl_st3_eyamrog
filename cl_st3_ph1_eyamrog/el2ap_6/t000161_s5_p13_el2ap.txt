Zootaxa hardly meets the aforementioned criteria for reasonable justification of
high self-citations. Also, self-citation has increased in the journal over
the years (Figure 4). Zootaxa is clearly not highly specialized.
A quick examination of its issues will confirm this point
and taxonomy as a whole is far from having only
a few other available journals, at least to most groups.
We compiled 123 journals that publish taxonomic papers, solely in
the JCR database (Table 1). Therefore, there are clearly many
options since these journals surely publish a great deal of
descriptive taxonomy (Figures 1–2). If specialization were true for Zootaxa,
we would expect that more specialized journals devoted to small
groups, such as Odonatologica (dragonflies) and Acarologia (mites), which together
represent a small part of extant diversity, would present similar
or even higher self-citation levels, which is not the case
(Figures 1–2, 5). On the other hand, we would also
expect that journals specialized in megadiverse groups, such as beetles,
bees, moths, butterflies, etc., would likewise have high levels of
self-citation, which again is not the case (Figures 2, 5).
Even journals dealing with taxa from a specific region of
the world, such as Neotropical Ichthyology or South American Journal
of Herpetology, also present significantly lower levels of self-citation. Therefore,
the scope of Zootaxa, with its focus on taxonomy, does
not explain the high level of self- citations. Instead, an
explanation should be looked for in the elements of the
Zootaxa phenomenon depicted above. A relevant aspect to be observed
in this discussion is that the great majority of the
citations given to the analyzed journals came from Zootaxa (Figures
1–3).
