A better understanding of the mechanisms of pathological changes in
critically ill patients hospitalized by COVID-19 has been increasingly the
focus of studies that aim to define more assertive therapies
and better clinical monitoring during the hospitalization of such patients.
Several clinical studies have revealed that the “inflammatory cytokines storm”18-20
is an important mechanism implicated in the worsening and mortality
of patients with COVID-19. One study revealed that IL-6 levels
in critically ill patients were significantly higher than in mild
cases, evidencing the contribution of this cytokine to many pathophysiological
effects in critically ill patients such as vascular leakage, complement
activation and coagulation cascade and induction, in very rare cases,
of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The same study showed that
the use of LMWH improves the coagulation dysfunction of patients
with COVID-19, as it has anti-inflammatory effects, that is, its
use can contribute to prevent or even reverse the cytokine
storm, thus improving the condition of the patients, and corroborating
its potential therapeutic use21. A study conducted at the Weill
Cornell Medicine in New York followed this intention to deepen
the pathophysiological knowledge on the disease using pulmonary and skin
biopsy and autopsy samples and from five individuals with severe
COVID-19. They found that at least some patients infected with
SARS-CoV-2 who became seriously ill suffered a generalized thrombotic microvascular
lesion that appears to be mediated by intense complement activation.
Although their five evaluated cases rendered generalization impossible, there is
a suspicion that a subset of critically ill patients with
COVID-19 may, together with their pro-coagulant state, have associated microvascular
lesions that are relevant to the unfavorable outcome that most
of these patients have22. Thus, the complement system can play
a critical role in the pathogenicity of the disease and
further studies in this area need to be developed.
