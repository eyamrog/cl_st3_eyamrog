The representativeness of Latin American data in genome projects and
public databases has been discussed since the beginning of the
genomic era (Ram√≠rez et al. 2002). The information stored in
databases has become essential to study the genetic diversity of
indigenous peoples (Harris et al. 2018), human diseases (Norris et
al. 2018), and regional biotechnological and agro-industrial challenges (Sasson &
Malpica 2018, Wang et al. 2017).
