A variation of rainfall rates per month in Santa Catarina
has been reported by Coan et al.13, being that the
highest values occurred in the north coast, between the months
of October and March, and the lowest ones in the
south coast, in the months from April to September, with
greater precipitation in the vale do Rio Itaja√≠ and in
the west of the State. These data corroborate the findings
of the present study, which identified in these regions and
in the same periods the occurrence of higher rates of
incidence of leptospirosis.
