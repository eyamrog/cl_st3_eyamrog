It is widely known that effective readers are those who
have appropriately developed reading skills. If those skills are not
developed, the readers will not achieve the levels of perception
needed to solve problems or pass academic tests, neither in
their mother tongue nor in a foreign language. For this
reason, it is imperative to find the right strategies to
enhance reading comprehension in English as Foreign Language (EFL) learners.
One of those strategies is the use of graphic organizers,
and this study aimed to measure the extent to which
it influences the development of reading comprehension of Unidad Educativa
Joaquin Lalama students, in Ambato-Ecuador. 40 students in the control
group and 35 students in the experimental group constituted the
sample. The data was collected through the observation technique and
the comparison of results from a reading comprehension pre-test and
post-test. Finally, this study found the use of graphic organizers
to be effective for developing reading comprehension in the subjects
observed.
