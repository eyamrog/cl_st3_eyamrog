The aim of this study was to analyze the temporal
trend of leptospirosis incidence according to rainfall levels in Santa
Catarina State between 2005 and 2015. This is an ecological
time-series study involving data on leptospirosis incidence and rainfall indexes
in Santa Catarina State Health Regions. The distribution of leptospirosis,
rainfall indexes, and cases/rainfall ratios, according to seasonality and stratified
by Health Regions, were evaluated. There were 5,274 cases, with
an average rate of 7.03 cases/100,000 inhabitants per year, varying
from 24 to 1,458 cases (Serra Catarinense and Northeast regions,
respectively) in Santa Catarina, revealing an increase in the rates
of 0.70 cases/100,000 inhabitants in Serra Catarinense and 13.99 cases/100,000
inhabitants in the Northeast. Four regions (Foz do Rio Itajaí,
Médio Vale do Itajaí, Grande Florianópolis and Northeast) were responsible
for 71.8% of the cases, particularly in the Northeast region
(38.5%). The five regions with the highest rates presented greater
risk of leptospirosis (RR > 1), ranging from 10.9 to
19.9 more new cases of the disease. The average rainfall
volume for Santa Catarina State was 158.69 mm, ranging from
136.44 mm in Laguna to 186.81 mm in the Northeast.
The five regions contributed with 32.8% of the rainfall index
accumulated in the period. In conclusion, leptospirosis occurred all around
Santa Catarina State, differing its temporal trend according to the
Health Regions.
