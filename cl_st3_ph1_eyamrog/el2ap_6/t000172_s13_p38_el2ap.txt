Tocilizumab is a humanized anti-IL6R monoclonal antibody that prevents IL-6
signaling. Preprint studies indicate that it is safe and shows
good efficiency against COVID-19. As there is a need for
more clinical trial data, it is suggested that it is
used only in critically ill patients with a profile of
high levels of IL-6 (Zhang et al. 2020a). Early clinical
data recommends the use of repeated doses (Luo et al.
2020). Some of the concerns that have been raised are
about the development of osteonecrosis of the jaws and the
development of acute hypertriglyceridemia (Bennardo et al. 2020; Morrison et
al. 2020).
