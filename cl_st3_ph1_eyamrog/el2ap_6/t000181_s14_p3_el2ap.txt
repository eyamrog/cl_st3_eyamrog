Participants first answered a socio-demographic survey that included specific questions
about chronic disease prevalence and social isolation levels during the
Covid- 19 pandemic. Then, we assessed distress by the Peri-Traumatic
Distress Index (CPDI), designed as a self-report questionnaire that measures
depression, anxiety, avoidance, compulsive behavior, specific phobias, cognitive change, physical
symptoms, and loss of social functioning (Qiu, Shen, Zhao, Wang,
Xie & Xu, 2020).
