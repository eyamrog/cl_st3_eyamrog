Currently, there is no specific advice regarding treatment for pregnant
women, children, or older patients (>60 years of age) with
MS during the COVID- 19 pandemic. As geriatric and pregnant
patients present an increased risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, and
a recent meta-analysis has shown that older patients may not
have an optimal response to MS treatment33, we suggest individual
risk-assessment when prescribing DMDs for pregnant and geriatric patients.
