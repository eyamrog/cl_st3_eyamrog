Although the findings of the present research, this study has
limitations. The methods applied, notably the Pearson coefficient for correlation,
without other studies regarding the flow of people or even
the flow of disease spread through the state of Minas
Gerais are less sensitive tools to point the cause of
the explored phenomena. The univariate analysis also limits our comprehension
of the role that each variable has in the overall
effect. Notwithstanding that, the procedures used, together with the literature,
are capable of directing new paths to clarify the nature
of the evidenced associations.
