The leptospirosis incidence is seasonal, usually with a peak in
the summer and fall in temperate climate countries, and during
the rainy seasons in tropical areas9. It is considered an
emerging infectious disease, since its burden is expected to worsen,
in both developed and developing countries, as global climate changes
cause more extreme weather events, such as floods, promoting leptospirosis
outbreaks9,10.
