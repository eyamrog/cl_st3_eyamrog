In addition, we include demographic, professional and economic information in
our analysis. Sex, age and marital status (whether they are
currently living with a couple) were the demographic variables. We
also evaluated additional professional information, such as having a specialty
(yes, in process, or no), whether they worked in other
institutions (yes / no), self-reported work-related illness (yes / no),
type of organization where they work (Ministry of Health, EsSalud,
Armed forces and national police, or Private clinics), and time
spent working. Additionally, self-reported monthly income was evaluated and categorized
according the minimum wage (less than four, four to ten,
and more than ten). Minimum wage was 750 Peruvian soles
(PEN) or US$222.5 (considered to be an exchange rate of
3.37 soles per US dollar).
