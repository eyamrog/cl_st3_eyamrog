While peer review is usually trusted and considered beneficial (Jubb,
2016; Mulligan et al., 2013), direct evidence on its benefits
is scarce (Jefferson et al., 2007; Smith, 2006; 2010), and
traditional peer review has received strong criticism and calls for
reform over the centuries (Csiszar, 2016; Ross-Hellauer, 2017; Tennant et
al., 2017). For instance, former medical editor Richard Smith (2006;
2010) denounced traditional peer review as inconsistent, biased, prone to
abuse, wasteful, resistant to innovative research, and missing most errors.
His former journal was one of the first to reform
peer review (Schroter et al., 2020) and, since then, the
movement grew into a “peer review revolution” (Tennant et al.,
2017).
