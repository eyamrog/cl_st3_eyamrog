During the intervention period, teachers guided students through the use
and familiarization with different graphic organizers that were considered appropriate
for each reading text. The reading material was selected taking
into account the age and interest of the group in
order to engage students. Every time new graphic organizers were
presented to the experimental group, the teacher highlighted their purpose
and how to use them; whereas the control group continued
working with reading activities, as they usually had been doing.
