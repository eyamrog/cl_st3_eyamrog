Current proposals show how it is possible to respond to
stigma with “an equally diverse set of cognitive, affective and
behavioral strategies” (Kreiner, Ashforth y Sluss 2006, p.619) at an
individual level and at a collective level. It is in
this sense that Ashforth and Kreiner point to the importance
of adopting a set of useful tools to promote strong
identification bonds with the job done, together with the conceptual
construction of sufficient justification that assigns meaning to the work
choice, which corresponds to the belief in the importance of
the task developed and the need for such task (1999).
