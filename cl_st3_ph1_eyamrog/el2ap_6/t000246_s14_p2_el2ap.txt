The searches were carried out on the Science web database
in April 2020 using the descriptor [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome]
and with a "title" filter. Access was via the CAPES
Journal Portal, using the credentials of the researcher at Rede
Cafe. The choice of base is due to its acceptance
in the world scientific community, especially in the area of
health, which provides summaries and citations of peer-reviewed scientific literature,
in addition to providing a more comprehensive view of the
world's research production. To perform the bibliometric analysis step, the
graphical interface of the VOSViewers® software and the Microsoft Excel
2017® tool were used.
