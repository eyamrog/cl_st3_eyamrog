As gender dimensions of the pandemic are both physical and
socially constructed, affecting the sexes differently (Smith, 2019), women are
perceived as being more aware of their need for healthcare,
more adherent to counseling and treatment, and likely, seeking healthcare
more often than men (Rugema et al., 2019) that explains
the higher number of female answers of this and other
surveys (Lauri Korajlija & Jokic‚Äê Begic, 2020).
