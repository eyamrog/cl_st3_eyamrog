Mycophenolate mofetil has proven to be effective in preventing NMOSD
relapses55. Its mechanism of action causes immunosuppression through cytostatic effects
on T and B cells. Data regarding its adverse effects
are mainly from transplant recipients and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
patient trials. Cytopenia and increased risk of bacterial and viral
infections are observed among these patients56,57. We recommend weekly CBC
and liver enzyme monitoring during the first 4â€“6 weeks of
treatment and every 3 months thereafter.
