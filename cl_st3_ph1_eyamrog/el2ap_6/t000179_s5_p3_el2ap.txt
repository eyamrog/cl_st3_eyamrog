In all, there is limited data on this topic in
the Latin American region and a great variety of scales
developed elsewhere that need further analysis and testing. The three
scales presented in our study have been created considering the
peculiarities of a middle-income country in the Latin American region
like Peru and reported adequate evidence of validity and reliability.
For example, the consideration that there are primary care centers
where water, drainage, and light may not be available permanently
(item c2p81_11), that many health professionals tend to work in
several institutions at the same time (items c2p82_3), or on
the way in which rotations or changes in opening hours
are organized (item c2p83_5). Therefore, they could be used as
a set of tools to evaluate different aspects of job
satisfaction in physicians in this and other Spanish speaking countries
with similar healthcare contexts.
