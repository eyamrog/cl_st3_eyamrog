The inferential analysis consisted of calculating Pearson's coefficients (8) for
correlation between the data obtained in the systems previously mentioned.
The data used for this analysis refer to the period
from March 4 to June 22, 2020. Only cities in
which there was at least one notification of the disease
until June 22 were considered. Therefore, it was necessary to
exclude cities that did not present notifications of COVID-19 until
that date, resulting in the exclusion of 215 cities. The
variables incidence, mortality, rate of rapid and molecular tests and
the date of the first notification were used to establish
Pearson's coefficients, both at the municipal level and at the
level of the health macro- regions.
