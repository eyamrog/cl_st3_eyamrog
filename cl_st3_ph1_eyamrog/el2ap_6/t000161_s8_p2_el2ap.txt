On the last day of June of this year, an
interruption of the colossal concerns about the Covid-19 pandemic affected
taxonomists around the world. An issue break through the media
due to the involvement of zoologists from many countries: the
suppression of the mega-journal Zootaxa, a periodical focused on zoological
taxonomy, from the Journal Citation Reportsâ„¢ (JCR) Science Edition metrics
by Clarivate. Based on a high proportion of self-citations, along
with other 32 journals from the 12,000 in JCR database,
Zootaxa would not receive a value of Journal Impact Factor
(JIF) for 2019; however, it would keep the values for
previous years and still be indexed on the Clarivate Analytics
platform.
