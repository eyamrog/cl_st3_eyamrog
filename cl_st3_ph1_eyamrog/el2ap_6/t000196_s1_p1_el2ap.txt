School feeding is part of for million students' routine worldwide.
Schools' closure during the COVID-19 pandemic brought to the fore
the challenge of providing food for children and adolescents by
alternative means, through food programs, whether governmental or otherwise. In
Brazil, approximately 40.1 [1] million children and adolescents enrolled in
basic public education were affected and went without their daily
meal during this period. To provide them food, most local
governments chose to transfer financial resources to their parents. The
challenge of knowing if children are receiving these meals adequately
during school closures, which can be lengthy, is the target
of this study. The current situation in the 27 Brazilian
federated entities regarding the transfer of funds and delivery of
meals is presented herein. A monitoring model is proposed for
children and adolescents to be followed during the pandemic, in
order to guarantee their adequate nutrition.
