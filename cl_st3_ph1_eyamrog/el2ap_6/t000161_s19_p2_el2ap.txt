The average levels of self-citations in the period of 2010–2018
range from 0.0–24.2% in Zoology, 0.0–34.9% in Entomology, and 4.6–34.9
in TTJ. For the last five years (2014–2018), these levels
are 0.0– 27.3% in Zoology, 0.0–36.4% in Entomology, and 4.5–36.4%
in TTJ. The upper bounds of self-citation in the Entomology
and TTJ categories are due to Systematic and Applied Acarology;
excluding this journal, the maximum level of self-citation for Entomology
is 21.4% (Coleopterists Bulletin) for 2010–2018 and 27.3% (Odonatologica) for
2014–2018, while for TTJ they are 26.3% and 27.5% (both
correspond to Cretaceous Research). In comparison to all other journals,
excluding Systematic and Applied Acarology, the mean levels of self-citation
are higher for Zootaxa than for any other journal in
Zoology (Figure 1), Entomology (Figure 2), and TTJ categories (Figure
3), being 34.9% for 2010–2018 and 37.6% for 2014–2018 in
Zootaxa. The levels of self-citation have gradually increased in Zootaxa
from 27.99% in 2010 to 52.7% in 2018 (Figure 4).
The percentage of self-citations for 2010–2018 is higher in Zootaxa
and similar only to Systematic and Applied Acarology (Figure 4).
The non-parametric one-way analysis of variance Kruskal-Wallis of Q2 and
Q3 journals, plus TTJ, is highly significant for both the
ratio of JIF without self-citation and JIF (JIF ratio: H
= 326.8, d.f. = 67, P < 0.001), as well
as to the proportion of self-citation (level of self-citation: H
= 311.4, d.f. = 67, P < 0.001).
