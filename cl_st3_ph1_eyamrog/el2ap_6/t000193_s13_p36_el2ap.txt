Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive agent occasionally used in NMOSD. At
a low-dose (e.g., 7.5 to 25 mg), myelosuppression is infrequent,
and most patients are not prone to opportunistic infections (unless
under concomitant use of high-dose corticosteroids)58. However, hepatotoxicity is common59.
Pancytopenia can occur with variable therapy intervals, but predisposing factors
are present in the majority of these patients (most often
impaired renal function)60. Thus, during the pandemic, we suggest CBC
and liver enzyme monitoring at a six-month interval for patients
on stable doses of methotrexate without adverse events in the
last six months. For patients under methotrexate <6 months or
with a prior history of adverse events, we recommend more
frequent monitoring (e.g., 2â€“3-month interval)61. Table 3 summarizes considerations regarding
DMD use for NMOSD during the COVID-19 pandemic.
