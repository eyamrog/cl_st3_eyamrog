A study was published in which the authors made a
cut of the analysis on March 21 and found similar
correlations between the importance of BCG vaccination and the incidence
and lethality of COVID-197. However, although the source of the
data was similar, this work used initial acceleration rates of
the number of cases and the number of deaths up
to April 11 and subsequent accelerations from April 11 to
May 11 (Figs. 1 and 2).
