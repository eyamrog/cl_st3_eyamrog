body in many ways, to increase alertness and positive feelings,
and decrease negative feelings of aggressiveness, depression and anxiety (60,
61). A study showed the effect of mindfulness and yoga
on quality of life for elementary school students and teachers
indicate that both benefit on intervention. The students who received
the intervention demonstrated significantly greater improvement in the psychosocial and
emotional quality of life compared with their peers who received
