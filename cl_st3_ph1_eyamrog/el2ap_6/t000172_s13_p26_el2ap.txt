SARS-CoV has also been described to arrest the cell cycle.
Nucleocapsid protein was shown to arrest cell cycle at S
phase, through direct interaction with cyclin D and inhibition of
the CDK4/Cyclin D complex, preventing phosphorylation of Rb (Retinoblastoma) protein,
a central player in cell cycle control (Surjit et al.
2006). IBV infection also reduces Cyclin D1, which participates in
G2/M transition, inducing cell cycle arrest at G2/M (Harrison et
al. 2007).
