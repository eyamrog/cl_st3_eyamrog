The great significance of Zootaxa cannot be denied and it
has become the most important vehicle for the publication of
taxonomic studies. However, it is obviously not the single journal
devoted to taxonomic science, such as depicted by some of
the supporting letters. So, why has the suppression caused that
enormous commotion? A quick answer is because in some megadiverse
countries, such as Brazil in which most of the fauna
remains undescribed, the higher education and scientific organizations evaluation systems
have entirely embraced bibliometric indexes (e.g., Curry 2018, Krüger 2020,
Reategui et al. 2020). Therefore, these metrics play an important
role in the system and, for instance, a Brazil-based author’s
choice of a scientific journal is largely based on values
such as JIF. Consequently, the suppression of Zootaxa was received
as a serious setback for taxonomists in such countries, especially
so of course for those who publish most or even
all their papers in the journal. This last aspect has
a clear influence on the high rate of self-citations, as
well as on the JIF of Zootaxa (Figures 1–3, 5),
even considering that Clarivate recognized that 20% of papers on
zoology were published by the journal.
