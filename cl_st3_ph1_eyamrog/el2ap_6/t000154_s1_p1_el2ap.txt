Scholarly journals should consider the attitudes of their communities before
adopting any of the seven traits of open peer review.
Unfortunately, surveys from the Global North might not generalize to
the Global South, where double-blind peer review is commonplace even
among journals on natural sciences and medicine. This paper reports
the findings of a survey on attitudes to open peer
review among four stakeholder groups of a scholarly-led medical journal
in Brazil: society members and journal readers, authors, and reviewers.
Compared to a previous survey recruiting mostly researchers on natural
sciences from Europe, this survey found similar support to open
peer review in general and for most of its traits.
One important exception was open identities, which were considered detrimental
by most participants, even more so in this survey than
in the previous one. Interestingly, participants were not so dismissive
of open identities when expressing whether they agreed with statements
about its specific consequences. Because preprints are increasingly popular but
incompatible with double-blind review, future research should examine the effects
of transitioning from double-blind to open identities, especially on gender
bias. Meanwhile, scholarly journals with double-blind review might prefer to
begin by adopting other traits of open review or to
make open identities optional at first.
