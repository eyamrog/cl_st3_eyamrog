The main difficulty in assessing the effectiveness of the SDS
adopted in São Paulo stems from the fact that the
amount of tests performed in the state is small, with
91,552 PCR test kits supplied to the state by the
Brazilian Ministry of Health until May 1st, 20206. Instituto Butantan,
the organization responsible for coordinating the testing in the state,
informed that 35,600 PCR tests were performed on April 22nd7.
Considering the 42-mil­ lion people in the state, this translates
into 85 tests per 100 thousand people; considering the whole
country, Brazil occupies the 133rd position among the countries that
test for ­COVID-198. In addition, there was a delay of
several weeks between collecting the sam­ ples and obtaining the
results in the initial phase of the epidemic. Finally, Brazilian
author­ ities, in their daily briefings and bulletins, inform the
number of cases and deaths due to ­COVID-19, using the
date in which test results were obtained, not the date
of the initial symptoms or the date of death.
