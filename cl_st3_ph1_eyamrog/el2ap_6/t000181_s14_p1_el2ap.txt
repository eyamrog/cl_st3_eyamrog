As the first module of the research project entitled Physical,
Psychological, and Cognitive reactions to Covid-19, a cross-sectional survey was
conducted from April 12th to 18th aiming to measure the
peri-traumatic stress and fear as psychological reactions during the Covid-19
pandemics. For that purpose, an online spreadsheet (Google Forms) was
used to send the questionnaire and scales to the participants
as a collecting information tool.
