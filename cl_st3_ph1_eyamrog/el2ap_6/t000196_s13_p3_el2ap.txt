During the pandemic, alternatives to classroom education such as distance
teaching and remote monitoring have been implemented to reduce the
impacts upon cognitive development as a consequence of material expected
to be otherwise taught throughout the school year. The care
and socialization offered by the school are factors to be
discussed, and the impact of the closure of schools upon
these factors is very large. However, social distancing makes it
difficult to make decisions about measures that address their mitigation.
The subject of this study, school food, has been addressed
as a relevant issue and it is necessary to assess
whether the measures taken for this purpose reflect the urgency
to solve this problem.
