One core trait, open identities, received the least support among
all traits, with few participants believing it would improve peer
review (Table 3), even if almost half the participants agreed
open identities would improve the quality of reviewer report, and
reviewers and authors should have the option of revealing their
own identities (Table 4). While many participants worried open identities
would inhibit reviewers from agreeing to review, fewer thought it
would inhibit authors from submitting. Furthermore, few participants agreed open
identities were fairer than traditional peer review.
