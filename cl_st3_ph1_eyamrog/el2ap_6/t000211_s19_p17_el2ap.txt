We should note that several studies have shown that the
patient with COVID-19 has a state of hypercoagulability2,5,6,11,12 and that,
therefore, the pulmonary microembolism index is probably higher than reported.
Hence, it is also possible that PE is already present
in many patients before admission, justifying the decreased response to
thromboprophylaxis in the hospital environment.
