Records from the Nucleotide, BioProject and PATRIC databases are biased
to pathogens probably reflecting the research field of groups that
frequently submit DNA data and the direction of research funding.
In the Nucleotide database, most records belong to Pasteurella multocida,
and Neisseria meningitidis, followed by Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Bacillus thuringiensis, Escherichia
coli, Shewanella sp., Aeromonas veronii, Homo sapiens, HIV, and Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Figure 2). 70.60% of the records belonged to Bacteria.
24.38%, to Eukaryota and 3.07%, to Viruses (Suppl. Inf. 2).
In addition, we found no records of Archaea submitted by
Peruvian institutions. Within Eukaryota, most of the records belonged to
clades Fungi and Viridiplantae and Phyla Chordata, Arthropoda, and Mollusca
(Suppl. Inf. 2). In BioProject, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar
Infantis is the most frequent record (Suppl. Inf. 3). PATRIC’s
most frequent records are pathogenic bacteria, namely, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Yersinia
pestis, Shigella sonnei, and Staphylococcus aureus (Suppl. Inf. 4). BOLD
presents different results because it is a Eukaryotic database. BOLD’s
most frequent taxa are, in descending order, Chordata (Aves and
Actinopterygii), Angiospermae, and Arthropoda (Insecta, and Arachnida) (Suppl. Inf. 5).
