Barbosa et al. [33] when following Brazilian children with and
without pneumonia, found that serum retinol levels were statistically lower
during the inflammatory process than after recovery (1.11±0.43 vs. 1.38±0.30μmol/L;
p<0.05). The authors attributed this finding due to the acute
phase response associated with reduced mobilization of hepatic nutrient reserves,
as well as the increased need for retinol secondary to
the improved activity of immune cells in pneumonia.
