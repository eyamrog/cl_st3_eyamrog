To identify factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, logistic regression models
were employed, with the odds ratio (OR) used as the
measure of association. Associations between the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies
(IgG, IgM, or both) and blood donor characteristics—including sex, age
group, educational level, place of residence, donation site, and period
of donation—were assessed using statistical tests at a 5% significance
level. All statistical analyses were conducted using STATA version 13
(StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).
