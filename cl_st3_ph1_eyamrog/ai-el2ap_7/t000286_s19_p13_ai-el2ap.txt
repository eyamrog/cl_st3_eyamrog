The results indicate that GD does not Granger-cause FDI, as
the null hypothesis is accepted at the 5% significance level,
with a probability value of 0.0934. Similarly, FDI does not
Granger-cause GD, as the null hypothesis is also accepted at
the 5% significance level, with a probability value of 0.3396,
which is further supported by the F-statistic value of 1.1474.
These findings suggest that there is no evidence of causality
between GD and FDI in either direction.
