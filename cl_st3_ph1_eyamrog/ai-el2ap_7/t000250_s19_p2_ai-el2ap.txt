The median score for depressive symptoms in the overall sample
was 9.00 (IQR = 10.00), with a mean of 9.98
(SD = 7.60) points on the BDI scale. Participants who
engaged in at least 30 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity
(MVPA) per day reported significantly lower depressive symptoms compared to
those who engaged in less than 30 minutes per day
(adjusted mean difference [AMD] = -0.707; 95% CI: -1.160 to
-0.253; p = 0.002). Additionally, individuals who spent less than
10 hours per day in sedentary behavior (SB) reported significantly
lower depressive symptoms than those who spent 10 hours or
more per day in SB (AMD = -1.736; 95% CI:
-2.704 to -0.768; p < 0.001).
