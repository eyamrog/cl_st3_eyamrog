Significant differences between rates were evaluated using the Student’s t-test
for data with normal distributions, with results reported as means
and standard errors, or the Mann-Whitney test for non-normally distributed
data, with medians (Mdn) reported. Comparisons among the three tree
and shrub size classes were conducted using one-way Analysis of
Variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey-Kramer post-hoc tests. Assumptions of normality
and homogeneity of variance were assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test,
Q-Q plots, and Levene’s test, respectively. Spatial dependence was quantified
by correlation analysis following the method of Legendre and Fortin
(1989), with an adjustment involving a reduction of two degrees
of freedom. Mortality (Mr) and recruitment (Rr) rates were calculated
using algebraic methods rather than logarithmic transformation, in accordance with
the recommendations of Sheil et al. (1995).
