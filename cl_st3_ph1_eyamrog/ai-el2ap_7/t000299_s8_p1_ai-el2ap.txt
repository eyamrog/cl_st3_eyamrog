Pacifier use has become increasingly prevalent across various contemporary cultures
[1] and represents one of the most common non-nutritive sucking
behaviors in children. Pacifiers are employed for multiple purposes, such
as soothing children, facilitating sleep, and addressing certain physiological and
psychological needs [2]. However, the literature presents conflicting evidence regarding
the potential benefits and risks associated with pacifier use [3].
In addition to reported advantages, concerns have been raised about
the role of pacifiers as vectors for microbial contamination and
transmission [3,4].
