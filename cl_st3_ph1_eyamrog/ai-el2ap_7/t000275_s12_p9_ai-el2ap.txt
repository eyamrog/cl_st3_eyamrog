The gloved hand removes the trocars in a "wrapped" manner,
while the other hand applies pressure to the plastic to
fully seal the incision site, thereby reducing the risk of
exposure to secretions, aerosols, and potential environmental contamination. All used
disposable materials should be placed in standard plastic disposal bags,
which must then be securely closed and the neck of
the bag twisted to form a knot, ensuring effective isolation
from the external environment.
