This rapid living review will systematically evaluate the best available
evidence on the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19, with the aim
of supporting clinical decision-making. Currently, there is no evidence from
randomized controlled trials demonstrating improvements in outcomes for patients with
confirmed COVID-19, and no drug has proven efficacy or regulatory
approval for this indication. Nevertheless, nearly two thousand ongoing trials
on SARS-CoV-2 infection are registered in the WHO International Clinical
Trials Registry Platform. Although various therapeutic classes are being investigated
as potential treatments for COVID-19, challenges remain regarding the availability
of drug-related information, time to clinical improvement, adverse events, and
mortality rates. There is an urgent need for reliable evidence
to determine which pharmacological treatments are most effective and safe
for SARS-CoV-2 infection. To ensure methodological rigor, this review will
adhere to the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews. This rapid systematic review, incorporating network meta-analysis and comprehensive
literature searches, is expected to synthesize the current evidence on
pharmacological treatments and provide relevant information to inform clinical decision-making
in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
