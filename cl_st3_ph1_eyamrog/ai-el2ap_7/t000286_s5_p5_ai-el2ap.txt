This indicates that approximately 34.97% of the systematic variation in
foreign direct investment (FDI) is explained by the explanatory variables
included in the model, while the remaining 65.03% is attributable
to other factors not accounted for in the analysis. Therefore,
the overall model demonstrates weak statistical significance in assessing the
impact of the selected macroeconomic variables on investment inflows in
Turkey.
