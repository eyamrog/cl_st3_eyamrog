The results indicate that EXC does not Granger-cause INT, as
the null hypothesis is accepted at the 5% significance level,
supported by a high probability value of 0.9582. Additionally, the
analysis shows that EXC does not Granger-cause INT in another
test, with the null hypothesis accepted at the 5% significance
level, as indicated by a probability value of 0.2365 and
an F-statistic of 1.5637. These findings collectively suggest that there
is no evidence of causality from EXC to INT.
