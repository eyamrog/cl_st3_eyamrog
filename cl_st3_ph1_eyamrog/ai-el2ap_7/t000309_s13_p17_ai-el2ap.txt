Currently, discontinuation of immunosuppressant therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD) is not recommended. Cessation of treatment carries a
risk of disease reactivation, and active inflammation is associated with
an increased likelihood of hospitalization, surgical intervention, infection, and the
need for corticosteroid use, which should be avoided during the
COVID-19 pandemic.
