Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is considered the
gold standard for virus detection and COVID-19 confirmation [9]. However,
several studies have reported a high prevalence of false-negative results,
which may be attributed to factors such as the type
of biological sample, inadequate sample collection, fluctuations in viral load,
and the interval between sample collection and symptom onset [10].
Therefore, the use of serological tests to detect acute-phase antibodies
(IgM) or memory antibodies (IgG) is also important. Given the
need for rapid results, it is crucial to employ diagnostic
tests that are simple, sensitive, and specific, providing immediate and
accurate identification of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 to support effective
control of viral transmission and enable timely public health interventions
[11].
