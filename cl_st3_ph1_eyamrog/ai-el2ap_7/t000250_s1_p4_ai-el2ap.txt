Conclusion: Higher levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and vigorous
physical activity (VPA) are associated with reduced odds of experiencing
depressive, anxiety, and combined depressive and anxiety (D&A) symptoms. In
contrast, higher levels of sedentary behavior (SB) are associated with
increased odds of depressive symptoms.
