Materials and Methods: This retrospective single-center study included 91 patients
who underwent both chest computed tomography (CT) and real-time polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing on the same day. CT findings
were categorized as negative, typical, indeterminate, or atypical. Diagnostic accuracy,
sensitivity, and specificity were calculated for two scenarios: in the
first scenario, only typical CT findings were considered positive; in
the second scenario, both typical and indeterminate CT findings were
considered positive.
