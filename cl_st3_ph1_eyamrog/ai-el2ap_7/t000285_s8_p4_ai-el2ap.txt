This finding indicates the potential for misdiagnosis, which may result
in delayed diagnosis, inappropriate treatment, and inefficient allocation of healthcare
resources (2,4). However, the specific effects of a potential syndemic
on patient outcomes and health systems remain unclear. Therefore, this
study aims to systematically review the literature to identify evidence
describing the clinical presentation, severity, and prognosis of coinfection with
SARS-CoV-2 and arboviruses, with the goal of informing decision-makers in
anticipation of possible future syndemic scenarios.
