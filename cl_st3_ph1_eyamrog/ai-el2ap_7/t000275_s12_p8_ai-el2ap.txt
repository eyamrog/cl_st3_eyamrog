Deflation: At the conclusion of the procedure, the infusion of
carbon dioxide is discontinued, and intracavitary gas is aspirated as
completely as possible through one of the trocars. After aspiration
is completed and the patientâ€™s abdomen has returned to a
flat contour, the surgeon inserts an arm beneath the previously
described sterile transparent plastic bag, which partially covers the arm
and fully covers the hand.
