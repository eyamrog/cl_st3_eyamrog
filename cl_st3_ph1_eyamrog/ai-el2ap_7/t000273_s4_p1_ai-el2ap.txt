The critical role of primary health care (PHC) in addressing
the COVID-19 pandemic is well established. Governments should prioritize the
strengthening of PHC to prevent exacerbation of the health crisis,
avoid rapid health system collapse, and reduce mortality from both
COVID-19 and other conditions sensitive to PHC, such as diarrheal,
respiratory, and cardiovascular diseases. Consequently, PHC constitutes a strategic resource
within the limited set of tools available for managing the
COVID-19 pandemic.
