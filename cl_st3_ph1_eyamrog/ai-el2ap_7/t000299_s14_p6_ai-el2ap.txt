The methodological quality of the studies was independently evaluated by
two reviewers (VS and DL), with any discrepancies resolved by
a supervisor (FM). The risk of bias was assessed based
on the following criteria: randomization of the selected pacifiers, use
of a disinfection control material (sterile water), comparable sample sizes,
a clearly described protocol, inclusion of more than one disinfection
method, and the application of statistical analysis. Each criterion present
in a study was marked as "yes," while absence of
information was marked as "no." Studies with one to two
"no" responses were classified as having a low risk of
bias, those with three to four "no" responses as having
an average risk of bias, and those with five to
six "no" responses as having a high risk of bias.
Any disagreements between the reviewers regarding quality assessment were resolved
by the supervisor (FM).
