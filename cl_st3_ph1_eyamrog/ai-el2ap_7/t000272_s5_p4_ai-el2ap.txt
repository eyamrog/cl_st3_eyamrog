The DTA curve indicates that the EE sample absorbs less
heat compared to the fractions. All samples exhibit an endothermic
peak between 85.0 and 130.0 째C, which is consistent with
the loss of moisture, water, or volatile solvents present in
each system. The TG curve for the EE sample reveals
three distinct thermal decomposition events. The first event, occurring between
30.00 and 86.96 째C, corresponds to the loss of water
and solvent, resulting in a mass loss of approximately 4.55%
of the total sample. The second event, observed from 87.01
to 205.75 째C, is likely associated with the degradation of
phytochemical compounds such as tannins and flavonoids, with a corresponding
mass loss of 21.54% (1.33 mg). The third event, beginning
at 205.85 째C, may be attributed to the degradation of
gallic acid, as this temperature aligns with the second stage
of phenol degradation, resulting in a total mass loss of
51.33% (3.17 mg). The thermal decomposition profile of the chloroform
fraction closely resembles that of the EE sample, with similar
decomposition peaks and mass loss percentages at each stage.
