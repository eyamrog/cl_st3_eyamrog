The present study was conducted in the Parque Estadual das
Fontes do Ipiranga (PEFI), located in the southeastern region of
the municipality of São Paulo, between latitudes 23°38'08''S and 23°40'18''S
and longitudes 43°36'48''W and 43°36'00''W. PEFI encompasses an area of
526.30 hectares and contains 24 sources of the Ipiranga Creek,
which supply nine reservoirs locally referred to as lakes. Among
these, the Garças, Cisnes, Ninfeias, and IAG reservoirs are particularly
notable due to their size. Further information regarding the Garças,
Ninfeias, and IAG reservoirs can be found in Bicudo et
al. (2002).
