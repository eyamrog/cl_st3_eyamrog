Current evidence indicates an international consensus that patients with inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) are not at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2
infection compared to the general population; however, it remains unclear
whether active inflammation in IBD patients contributes to a higher
susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, it is uncertain whether IBD patients
who contract SARS-CoV-2 are at greater risk of developing COVID-19,
or experience higher rates of complications or mortality associated with
the disease. Data on outcomes in immunosuppressed IBD patients with
SARS-CoV-2 infection are particularly limited.
