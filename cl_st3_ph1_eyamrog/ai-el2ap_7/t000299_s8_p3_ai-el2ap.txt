Given the potential for contamination and transmission of microorganisms, particularly
SARS-CoV-2, effective disinfection of pacifiers is essential [4,8,9], as routine
cleaning practices often involve only rinsing with running water and
drying, which may be insufficient [10]. There is a limited
body of research globally regarding the efficacy of various pacifier
disinfection methods in reducing microbial contamination. The objective should not
be to discourage pacifier use, but rather to ensure that
appropriate disinfection protocols are followed to promote oral health and
prevent oral infections in children [9,11].
