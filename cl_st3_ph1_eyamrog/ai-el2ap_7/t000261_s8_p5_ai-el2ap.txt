Long-term monitoring involves the measurement of numerous variables, which can
complicate public understanding and hinder effective management decision-making. To address
this challenge, trophic state indexes (TSIs) have been developed and
refined since the 1970s. TSIs are designed to assess aquatic
productivity and eutrophication, providing reliable information on ecosystem health. In
São Paulo State, Lambarelli (2004) developed a TSI that has
been widely adopted; this index is based on the classic
Carlson’s TSI (Carlson 1977) but incorporates modifications to account for
the specific dynamics of tropical reservoirs.
