Pacifier nozzles are typically made from either latex or silicone.
Currently, silicone nozzles are preferred due to their lower allergenic
potential, reduced surface roughness, and decreased microbial adhesion compared to
latex [6,7]. Although latex surfaces are more irregular than silicone
surfaces, making them more likely to serve as reservoirs for
biofilm and potential sources of infection [6], silicone pacifiers can
also support microorganism adhesion and may still pose a risk
of infection [4,7]. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that latex
pacifiers exhibit significantly increased surface porosity and roughness following disinfection
procedures involving heat treatment, compared to untreated latex pacifiers [15].
