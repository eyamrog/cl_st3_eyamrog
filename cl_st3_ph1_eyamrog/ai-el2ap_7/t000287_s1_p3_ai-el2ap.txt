Among the 60 employees tested, 4 were positive for SARS-CoV-2
and were subsequently isolated. This approach may assist healthcare services
in identifying asymptomatic healthcare workers, thereby supporting the health of
both staff and patients. Additionally, it has the potential to
reduce transmission risk while minimizing the likelihood of staff shortages
during periods of increased demand.
