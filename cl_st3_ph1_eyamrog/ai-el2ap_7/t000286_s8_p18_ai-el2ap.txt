The high volatility of inflation in Turkey is currently causing
significant challenges for the country's economy and negatively impacting investment
inflows. This occurs because unmonitored and unstable inflation disrupts economic
transactions, including buying and selling activities. Furthermore, investors are generally
reluctant to allocate capital to countries where inflation rates are
not effectively monitored and maintained at stable levels, as this
increases the risk of financial losses.
