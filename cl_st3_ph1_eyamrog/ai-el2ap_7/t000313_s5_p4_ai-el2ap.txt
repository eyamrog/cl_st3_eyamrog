In contrast to the significant differences observed among the 70
orthologues in mammals, no relevant polymorphisms were identified in these
30 ACE2 binding sites within human populations. Thus, Homo sapiens
appears to be a genetically homogeneous primate species with respect
to these 30 critical ACE2 binding sites. Furthermore, Homo sapiens
has a large global population, estimated at approximately 7.5 billion
individuals, distributed across nearly all habitable regions of the planet,
including areas with high population density. These findings suggest that
the high and efficient viral tropism is likely applicable to
all human populations, and that demographic and cultural factors specific
to certain populations may further facilitate the transmission and spread
of this opportunistic coronavirus.
