Two reviewers (VS and DL) independently extracted data using a
standardized form. When available in the reviewed articles, the following
variables were recorded: country of study, study design, pacifier material,
sample size (n), microorganisms analyzed, decontamination methods employed, accessibility of
methods, and reported results. Discrepancies between reviewers were resolved by
consensus with the involvement of a supervisor (FM). Due to
heterogeneity among the studies, a meta-analysis was not conducted; instead,
study characteristics and results were analyzed qualitatively.
