This study has several limitations, including a small sample size
and a short follow-up period. The RT-PCR test, which was
used as the gold standard in this study, is generally
considered to have high specificity but only moderate sensitivity (60â€“70%)
for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (10,11). RT-PCR is subject
to potential preanalytical vulnerabilities, such as inadequate procedures for specimen
collection, handling, transport, and storage, as well as analytical issues,
including testing outside the optimal diagnostic window and other technical
factors (28). Previous studies have shown that patients with COVID-19
may exhibit early chest CT changes even before RT-PCR results
become positive (11,29). Therefore, the most effective diagnostic approach for
suspected COVID-19 cases may involve integrating clinical and epidemiological assessment
with RT-PCR testing and chest CT findings, and repeating RT-PCR
in patients who initially test negative but have a high
clinical and radiological probability of COVID-19.
