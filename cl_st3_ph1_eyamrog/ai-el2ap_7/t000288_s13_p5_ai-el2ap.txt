Host factors significantly influence susceptibility to infection and the progression
of disease. Studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its entry receptor. The S-glycoprotein on
the surface of the virus binds to the ACE2 receptor
on human cells, facilitating viral entry. Upon binding and fusion
with the host cell membrane, the viral RNA genome is
released into the cytoplasm, where it is translated into two
polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. These polyproteins encode non-structural proteins that
assemble into the replication and transcription complex (RTC), thereby enabling
the continuation of the viral replication cycle. Host antiviral defense
mechanisms are critical in determining the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Type I interferons (IFNs), particularly IFN-β, serve as a primary
defense by initiating antiviral responses. Following viral infection, the host
innate immune system is activated through the recognition of viral
components such as single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), or
viral glycoproteins. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) are
the principal pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that detect RNA viruses.
Activation of these receptors triggers an antiviral signaling cascade, resulting
in the phosphorylation and activation of IRF3 and NF-κB, which
in turn promote the production of type I IFNs. The
secretion of IFN-β stimulates the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs),
leading to the production of host antiviral effector proteins.
