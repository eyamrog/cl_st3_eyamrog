In 2006 and 2012, the most abundant species across all
sampled size classes were late-successional species representative of the principal
families typically found in the later successional stages of Dense
Ombrophylous Forest (Tabarelli & Mantovani 1999; Catharino 2006; Arzolla 2011).
Myrtaceae, Lauraceae, Rubiaceae, and Fabaceae were the most species-rich families,
collectively accounting for approximately 50% of the total species recorded
(Table 2), with Myrtaceae and Lauraceae exhibiting the highest species
richness, a pattern characteristic of mature Dense Montane Ombrophylous Forest
(Tabarelli & Mantovani 1999; Franco et al. 2007; Arzolla et
al. 2011).
