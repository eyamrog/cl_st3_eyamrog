We found significant associations between increased time spent in sedentary
behavior (SB) and the severity of depression and anxiety symptoms
after adjusting for covariates, including time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical
activity (MVPA). Additionally, individuals who spent more than 10 hours
per day in SB were more likely to exhibit prevalent
depressive symptoms, but not anxiety or co-occurring depression and anxiety
symptoms. This difference may be attributable to the possibility that
durations exceeding 10 hours per day of SB are required
to significantly influence the presence of anxiety symptoms.
