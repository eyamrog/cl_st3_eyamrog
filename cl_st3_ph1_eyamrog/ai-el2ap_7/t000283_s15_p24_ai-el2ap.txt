We will conduct a network meta-analysis using the netmeta package
version 1.2-1 in R version 3.6.2 for Mac to synthesize
both direct and indirect evidence regarding pharmacological therapeutic effects. In
cases where a loop connects three treatment arms, we will
assess inconsistency between direct and indirect comparisons using the node-splitting
method. Treatment rankings will be presented using P-scores, which are
calculated based on the point estimates and standard errors derived
from the available network.
