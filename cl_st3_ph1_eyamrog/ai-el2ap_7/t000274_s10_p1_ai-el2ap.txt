Doctors and healthcare professionals are currently confronted with a pandemic
caused by the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). The full clinical
spectrum of human infection with COVID-19 has not yet been
completely characterized, and the precise patterns of lethality, mortality, infectivity,
and transmissibility remain unclear. At present, no specific vaccine or
targeted pharmacological treatment is available, and management is limited to
supportive and nonspecific care. The global incidence of COVID-19 cases
has increased rapidly, leading to a rise in hospitalizations and
mortality rates.
