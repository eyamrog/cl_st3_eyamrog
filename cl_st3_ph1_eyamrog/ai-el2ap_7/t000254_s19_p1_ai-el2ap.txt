Composition and Structure in 2012 – In total, 901 individuals
were sampled in 2012, including survivors from 2006 as well
as individuals that died or were recruited during the study
period (Table 1). Of these, 708 individuals belonged to the
shrub-tree synusia, 190 to the climbers, and three to the
hemiepiphytes (comprising two recruits and one survivor). Among the three
ferns present in 2006 and classified within the shrub-tree group,
only one survived until 2012. The overall growth rate for
all plant groups and size classes indicated an increase in
the total number of individuals (λ > 1, 95% CI
= 1.003 ± 0.003).
