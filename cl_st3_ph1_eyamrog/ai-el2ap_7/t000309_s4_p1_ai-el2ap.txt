During the COVID-19 pandemic, access to accurate safety information and
guidance is essential. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may
have an increased risk of COVID-19 complications due to both
the underlying chronic condition and, in particular, the use of
immunosuppressive therapies. In response to these circumstances, our group has
modified IBD care by reprioritizing clinical objectives, disseminating relevant information
to patients, and ensuring the continuity of necessary treatments. It
is also important to recognize that in developing countries, a
substantial proportion of the population resides in conditions characterized by
overcrowding, informal housing, and inadequate sanitation, which require targeted interventions
and adaptive strategies from health authorities. In this context, particularly
for IBD patients, individualized treatment approaches are essential, with careful
consideration of both potential benefits and risks.
