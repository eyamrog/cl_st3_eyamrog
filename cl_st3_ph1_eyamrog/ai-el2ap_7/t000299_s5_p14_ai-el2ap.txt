The issue of chlorhexidine-related microbial resistance remains a subject of
debate [28]. While some studies have not demonstrated the emergence
of resistant microorganisms [30], other research indicates that certain strains
may develop tolerance after prolonged exposure to chlorhexidine [31]. It
is important to note that, in the context of pacifier
disinfection, the potential adverse effects of chlorhexidine are minimized because
the application occurs outside the oral cavity and does not
involve direct mucosal contact [10]. Consequently, a thorough cost-benefit analysis
is warranted when considering the use of this antimicrobial agent.
