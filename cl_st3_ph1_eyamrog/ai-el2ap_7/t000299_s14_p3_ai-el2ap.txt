Studies related to pacifier disinfection published between January 1999 and
October 2019 were considered eligible for inclusion, with no language
restrictions applied. The inclusion criteria required studies to analyze different
types of pacifier disinfection, regardless of the specific method used,
and to include at least one comparative group. Exclusion criteria
were as follows: (1) studies that addressed topics unrelated to
pacifier disinfection; (2) studies that focused solely on pacifier contamination
and/or biofilm formation without evaluating disinfection methods; and (3) duplicate
studies.
