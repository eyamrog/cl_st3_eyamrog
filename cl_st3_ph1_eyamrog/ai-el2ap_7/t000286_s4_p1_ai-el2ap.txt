This study demonstrates that increases in government deficit and exchange
rates have a positive and significant effect on foreign direct
investment (FDI) inflows in the country. The findings indicate that
both variables play a critical role in influencing foreign investment.
Therefore, it is important to manage government deficits and exchange
rates effectively to sustain a stable and conducive environment for
economic growth, which can further attract foreign capital inflows.
