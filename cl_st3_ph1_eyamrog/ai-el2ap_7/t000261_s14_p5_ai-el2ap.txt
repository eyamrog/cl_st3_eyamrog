After identifying critical changepoints in the data, we conducted an
analysis using piecewise (or segmented) regression, which involves fitting separate
linear segments to different intervals of the data. In this
approach, one or more breakpoints are treated as parameters within
the model, allowing for the identification of time points associated
with significant changes in the relationship between variables. The presence
of a so-called “nuisance parameter” complicates the statistical inference, rendering
standard statistical tests inapplicable (Muggeo 2008), and thus classical p-values
cannot be used for hypothesis testing in this context. To
address this limitation, we applied the Davies test (Davies 1977)
to assess whether there were statistically significant differences between the
slopes of adjacent segments. It should be noted that the
Davies test does not estimate the location of the breakpoint
itself, but rather tests for a non-zero difference in slope
between segments. All analyses were performed using the segmented package
(Muggeo 2008) in the R statistical environment (R Core Team
2019).
