The bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine was originally developed for the
prevention of tuberculosis and has subsequently been shown to exert
additional effects by activating and/or training the innate immune system.
In the absence of a specific vaccine for the novel
coronavirus, it is necessary to investigate and evaluate the potential
protective effects of the BCG vaccine against this pathogen.
