The dynamic interaction between hosts and pathogens is characterized by
ongoing evolutionary adaptations. Several studies have demonstrated that coronaviruses have
evolved mechanisms to recognize a variety of host receptors, while
hosts have concurrently developed strategies to counteract viral infection. For
instance, Peng et al. (2017) reported that infection with murine
hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) exerts selective pressure on the mouse receptor
mCEACAM1a. This selective pressure has resulted in amino acid substitutions
that produced a derived allele, mCEACAM1b, which exhibits significantly reduced
functionality as an MHV receptor. As a result, mice homozygous
for the mCEACAM1b allele display a high level of resistance
to mortality following MHV infection (Peng et al., 2017).
