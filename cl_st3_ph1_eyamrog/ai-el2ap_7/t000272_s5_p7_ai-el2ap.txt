The endothermic peaks observed in the differential thermal analysis (DTA)
correspond to the degradation temperature ranges identified in the thermogravimetric
(TG) curves of the samples. No exothermic events were detected.
The more polar fractions exhibit distinct endothermic peaks compared to
those observed for the ethanolic extract (EE) and the ethyl
acetate fraction. Consequently, it can be inferred that both the
hexane and chloroform fractions require less thermal energy to initiate
degradation.
