The data source is official and published by Johns Hopkins
Hospital. Countries were selected in descending order based on the
number of reported cases as of April 11, 2020, and
categorized into two groups: the first group includes countries with
no tuberculosis vaccination programs or with low vaccination coverage, while
the second group comprises countries with the highest vaccine coverage,
either through administration at birth or at two or more
life stages. These categories were further divided into seven subgroups,
each consisting of the countries listed above and the rationale
for their classification, as detailed in Table 1.
