In the presence of significant heterogeneity or inconsistency, subgroup analyses
will be conducted. When feasible, the following variables will be
examined: age, sex, comorbidities, strategies implemented to address the pandemic
threat (such as quarantine, lockdown, and social distancing), and disease
severity. Additionally, sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess the
impact of including studies with a high risk of bias
and missing data.
