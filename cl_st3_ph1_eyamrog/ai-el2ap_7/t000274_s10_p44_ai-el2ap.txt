Personal protective equipment (PPE) constitutes only one component of a
comprehensive system designed to prevent contamination among healthcare professionals. In
addition to the use of PPE, effective infection control requires
procedures such as the decontamination of surfaces and equipment, minimizing
unnecessary contact with patients and environmental surfaces, and implementing rigorous
waste management practices to reduce the risk of transmission.
