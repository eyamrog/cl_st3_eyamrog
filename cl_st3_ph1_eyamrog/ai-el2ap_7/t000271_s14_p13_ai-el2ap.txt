The estimation of population prevalence of COVID-19 was conducted in
three steps. First, the unadjusted proportion of positive test results
was calculated. Second, the prevalence was weighted according to the
2020 Rio de Janeiro State population to account for differences
in the distribution of sex and age between the sample
and the general population. Third, the prevalence was further adjusted
for test sensitivity and specificity, using the manufacturerâ€™s reported values
of 85% and 99%, respectively. The adjusted prevalence and corresponding
95% confidence intervals were estimated using a previously published method
[19].
