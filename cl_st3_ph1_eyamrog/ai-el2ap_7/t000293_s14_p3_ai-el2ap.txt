Typical findings include multifocal ground-glass opacities with a round morphology,
predominantly distributed in the peripheral, posterior, and lower lung zones.
These opacities may be present with or without consolidation and
can be accompanied by visible intralobar lines (referred to as
"crazy paving"), as well as the halo sign and reversed
halo sign (see Figure 1).
