Health professionals are at increased risk of infection due to
their frontline roles in managing COVID-19. The prioritization of personal
protective equipment is essential and should be accompanied by the
adaptation of clinical procedures, including surgical interventions, to minimize infection
risk. Procedures that involve exposure to patient aerosols, such as
cricothyroidotomy and tracheostomy, require specific modifications and comprehensive training for
emergency physicians and surgeons. The protection and effective utilization of
health professionals are critical to the ongoing response to the
pandemic.
