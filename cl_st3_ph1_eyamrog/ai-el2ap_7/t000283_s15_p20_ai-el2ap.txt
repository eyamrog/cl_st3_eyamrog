Based on pre-specified eligibility criteria, two authors (ACPNP and APR)
will independently select studies for inclusion in the review. When
duplicate studies are identified across multiple databases, only one instance
will be considered for inclusion. If multiple reports are identified
that use the same participants but assess different outcomes or
use different assessment time points, both reports will be included
and treated as components of a single study. In cases
where duplicate reports are found with identical participants, outcome measurements,
and assessment time points, the report with the smaller sample
size will be excluded. After removing duplicate studies and reports,
the authors will screen study titles and abstracts, excluding those
that clearly do not meet the inclusion criteria. The remaining
studies will undergo full-text review, and reasons for exclusion at
this stage will be documented. Any disagreements regarding study inclusion
will be resolved by a third author (ANA). The Rayyan
application will be used to facilitate the screening and selection
process.
