Conclusion: Computed tomography (CT) demonstrates high accuracy in the diagnosis
of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The use of different interpretation criteria allows
for the prioritization of either sensitivity or specificity, depending on
clinical requirements. In resource-limited settings during the pandemic, CT may
be effectively integrated as a triage tool to optimize the
allocation of PCR testing, isolation beds, and intensive care unit
resources.
