Several antimicrobial agents have been evaluated in hospital settings for
their efficacy against various coronaviruses, including isopropanol, povidone-iodine, ethanol, and
sodium hypochlorite. Some of these agents, such as sodium hypochlorite
and ethanol, are also widely available outside medical and laboratory
environments, which increases their accessibility to the general population. Evidence
indicates that surfaces treated with 70% ethanol demonstrated effective disinfection
against two types of coronaviruses—mouse hepatitis virus and transmissible gastroenteritis
virus—after one minute of contact, whereas 0.06% sodium hypochlorite was
less effective under the same conditions. Studies involving SARS-CoV have
shown that sodium hypochlorite is effective at concentrations between 0.05%
and 0.1% after five minutes of exposure. Additionally, a study
comparing the surface stability of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, the most
closely related human coronavirus, provided further insights, as summarized in
