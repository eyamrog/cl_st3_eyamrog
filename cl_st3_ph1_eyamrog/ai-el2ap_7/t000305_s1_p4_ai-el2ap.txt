Results: Countries without a BCG vaccination program, or that have
never implemented one, exhibited incidence and mortality acceleration rates that
were 21.36 and 53.21 times higher, respectively, than those observed
in countries with a universal vaccination program (p < 0.001).
Furthermore, countries with an expanded vaccination program demonstrated a 43%
lower mortality rate compared to those with a vaccination program
limited to administration at birth (p < 0.001).
