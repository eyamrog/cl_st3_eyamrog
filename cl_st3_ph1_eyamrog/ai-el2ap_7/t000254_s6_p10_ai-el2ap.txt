The soil in the park is highly acidic and nutrient-poor
(Struffaldi De Vuono 1985; Gomes & Mantovani 2001), but it
is comparable to soils found in other forests of Southeastern
Brazil (Gomes & Mantovani 2001). Moraes (2002), in a study
conducted during the 1990s on litter production and decomposition, did
not identify any abnormalities in a preserved area of the
park. It is important to note that the parkâ€™s vegetation
was exposed to gas emissions from a nearby steel mill
for approximately 60 years, which, according to Struffaldi-De-Vuono (1985), resulted
in forest pollution, tree mortality, and degradation of part of
the vegetation. Nagaoka & Marcelli (1989) also reported a significant
decline in lichen populations in the park, attributing this to
the same pollution source. The area continues to be affected
by air pollution due to its location within a fully
urbanized environment. Domingos et al. (2002) detected evidence of atmospheric
pollution in herbaceous bioindicator plants situated outside the forest. Consequently,
there is a need for targeted studies in the current
decade focusing on trees and lianas growing in forest soil
to assess both the cumulative and ongoing effects of pollution
on plant dynamics.
