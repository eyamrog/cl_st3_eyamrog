Boiling water for 15 minutes has been shown to effectively
eliminate C. albicans contamination, achieving a 100% reduction [8]. Similar
results have been reported by other studies, which found that
five minutes of boiling was sufficient to disinfect pacifiers contaminated
with S. mutans and C. albicans [15]. Additionally, some authors
recommend boiling pacifiers for 15 minutes to ensure the removal
of cariogenic microorganisms [10].
