We present a synthesis (2006–2012) of plant community dynamics within
a 1-hectare area of the largest remaining Atlantic Rain Forest
fragment surrounded by the city of São Paulo. All plants
with a diameter at breast height (dbh) of ≥ 2.5
cm, including climbers, were sampled in 10 transects (2 ×
50 m), while smaller individuals (> 1 m in height
and < 2.5 cm dbh) were sampled in 10 subtransects
(1 × 50 m). A total of 901 individuals representing
125 species from 38 families were recorded, including 83 late-successional
species, 12 species classified as threatened with extinction, and 56
species not listed in the area’s management plan, some of
which are categorized as Endangered (EN). Climbers exhibited the greatest
dynamics, with the largest decrease in basal area, while both
larger trees (> 5.0 cm dbh) and smaller trees (<
2.5 cm dbh) showed the highest mortality rates within the
shrub-tree synusia. Regeneration of late-successional species was predominant, and the
forest demonstrated progression toward more advanced successional stages during the
monitoring period.
