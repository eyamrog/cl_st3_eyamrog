The results indicate that EXC does not Granger-cause INF, as
the null hypothesis is accepted at the 5% significance level,
with a probability value of 0.0635. Similarly, INF does not
Granger-cause EXC, as evidenced by the acceptance of the null
hypothesis at the 5% significance level, with a probability value
of 0.4724 and an F-statistic of 0.781. These findings suggest
that there is no evidence of causality in either direction
between EXC and INF within the context of this analysis.
