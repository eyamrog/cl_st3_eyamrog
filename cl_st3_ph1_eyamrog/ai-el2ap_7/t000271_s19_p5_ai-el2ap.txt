In the logistic regression analyses (Table 2), several covariates were
significantly associated with crude SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence. The period of
blood collection demonstrated the strongest association with prevalence, with later
collection periods corresponding to higher prevalence rates. Specifically, the odds
of a positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody result in the third period
were twice as high as in the first period (OR=2.05;
95% CI: 1.33â€“3.16). Among socio-demographic characteristics, younger blood donors exhibited
higher prevalence rates, and individuals with lower educational levels had
increased odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. No statistically
significant differences were observed with respect to sex or municipality
of residence (capital versus other areas). Additionally, the site of
blood collection was significantly associated with crude prevalence, as blood
donors from condominiums had a significantly lower prevalence compared to
those from Hemorio.
