Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among individuals in
self-isolation. Participants self-reported moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), vigorous physical activity
(VPA), moderate physical activity (MPA), and sedentary behavior (SB), which
served as exposure variables. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed
using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory
(BAI), respectively. Associations between MVPA, VPA, MPA, and SB and
the prevalence of depressive symptoms (BDI > 9), anxiety symptoms
(BAI > 7), and comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms (BDI
> 9 and BAI > 7) were examined using logistic
regression analyses, with results reported as odds ratios (OR) and
95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Linear regression analyses were also
conducted to assess associations with symptom severity. All models were
adjusted for potential confounding variables.
