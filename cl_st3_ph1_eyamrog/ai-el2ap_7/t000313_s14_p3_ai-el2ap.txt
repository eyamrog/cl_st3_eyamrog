The consensus phylogeny of species, based on neutral molecular markers,
was obtained from the Timetree server (www.timetree.org; Kumar et al.,
2017) and is widely used as a reference in the
literature, following Meredith et al. (2011). To investigate the evolutionary
patterns affecting ACE2, a Site Model (NsSite) test was conducted
using the Codeml package in PAML 4.9 software (Yang, 2007),
which enables interspecific phylogenetic comparisons of substitution rates in protein-coding
genes. This test allows for variation in the ω ratio
(ω = dN/dS, where dN is the rate of non-synonymous
substitutions and dS is the rate of synonymous substitutions) across
sites, fitting models of neutral evolution (ω ≈ 1), selective
constraint (ω < 1), or positive selection (ω > 1)
to the observed data. To identify the model that best
fits the data, Likelihood Ratio Tests were performed (Yang, 1998),
specifically comparing the neutral model (M1) to the model allowing
for positive selection (M2a) with two degrees of freedom (Yang,
2007). The Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) approach was used to
identify sites with a high probability of being under positive
selection (Yang et al., 2005). Additionally, amino acid variation in
ACE2 coding sequences from placental mammals was classified into four
categories of chemical similarity according to the Grantham score (Grantham,
1974): conservative (GS ≤ 50), moderately conservative (GS = 51–100),
moderately radical (GS = 101–150), and radical (GS ≥ 151).
