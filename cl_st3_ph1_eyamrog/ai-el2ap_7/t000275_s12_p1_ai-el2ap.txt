Operating room setup: The use of personal protective equipment (PPE)
is currently mandatory for all procedures due to the COVID-19
pandemic. All healthcare professionals involved in surgical procedures are required
to wear hats, goggles, gloves, N95 masks, face shields, and
the standard sterile garments used by the surgical team. Whenever
possible, procedures should be conducted in rooms with negative pressure.
Airway induction and intubation should be performed only by the
anesthesiologist and an assisting nurse, minimizing the number of personnel
present in the operating room during this high-risk phase. After
the airway is secured and the patient is connected to
the ventilatory system, the remaining surgical team may enter the
operating room to position the patient, prepare the surgical table,
and carry out any additional tasks necessary for the procedure.
