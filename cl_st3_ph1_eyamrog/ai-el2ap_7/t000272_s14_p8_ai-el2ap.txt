Total flavonoid content was determined using the method described by
Meda et al. (2005). Aluminum chloride (AlCl3) was added to
the extract, which was then diluted in 2% methanol. After
a 10-minute incubation period, the absorbance of the sample was
measured at 415 nm using a Shimadzu UV mini-1240 spectrophotometer.
A calibration curve was constructed with quercetin standard solutions, and
flavonoid concentrations were expressed as milligrams of quercetin equivalents.
