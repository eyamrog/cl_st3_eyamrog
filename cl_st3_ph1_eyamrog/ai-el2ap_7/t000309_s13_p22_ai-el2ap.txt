In the event that signs or symptoms indicative of COVID-19
develop, patients are advised to promptly notify their healthcare team.
It is recommended that immunosuppressive therapy be temporarily discontinued until
the infection has resolved. Resumption of therapy should occur only
after complete resolution of COVID-19 symptoms or, preferably, following two
consecutive negative PCR tests from nasopharyngeal swabs collected at least
24 hours apart. However, this testing strategy may not be
feasible in Brazil due to limited availability of coronavirus tests
(14,20).
