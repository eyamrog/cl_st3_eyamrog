The Garças Reservoir (23°38'40.6"S, 46°37'28.0"W) is a shallow tropical water
body located within the Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga,
a protected area of Atlantic Rain Forest in the city
of São Paulo, São Paulo State, southeastern Brazil (Figure 1).
The reservoir was created in 1894 by damming the Campanário
Creek to address increasing demands for drinking water, resulting in
the formation of a larger water supply reservoir known as
the Campanário Reservoir. Around 1917, the Campanário Reservoir was subdivided
into five smaller water bodies, with Garças Reservoir remaining as
the principal system. Eutrophication began following the discharge of untreated
sewage from the city zoo in 1958 and was exacerbated
by additional untreated sewage from the São Paulo State Department
of Agriculture in 1975 (Costa-Böddeker et al. 2012). The resulting
increase in allochthonous nutrient inputs, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, led
to extensive macrophyte proliferation, with plant coverage reaching 40–70% of
the water surface and contributing to increased mosquito populations. In
response, local authorities mandated the mechanical removal of all macrophyte
cover, which was completed within two months (September 1999), subsequently
causing a rapid transition of the reservoir from a eutrophic
to a hypereutrophic state characterized by persistent cyanobacterial blooms (Bicudo
et al. 2007). In 2014, the reservoir experienced an invasion
of Ceratium furcoides, attributed to disturbances sufficient to disrupt the
ongoing dominance of cyanobacterial blooms (Crossetti et al. 2019). Additional
details regarding the climate, morphometric characteristics, and limnological changes of
the reservoir are provided in Bicudo et al. (2007) and
Crossetti et al. (2019).
