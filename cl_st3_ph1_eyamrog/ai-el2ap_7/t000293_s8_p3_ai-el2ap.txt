Cancer patients have an increased risk of developing COVID-19 and
tend to experience a worse prognosis compared to individuals without
cancer (20). Computed tomography (CT) findings may be linked to
a higher likelihood of severe outcomes in cancer patients (21).
Additionally, these patients are at elevated risk for other pulmonary
complications related either to the underlying malignancy or its treatment,
including opportunistic infections, thromboembolism, drug toxicity, and radiation-induced pneumonitis, among
others (22,23). Such complications may serve as differential diagnoses or
may coexist with SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients.
