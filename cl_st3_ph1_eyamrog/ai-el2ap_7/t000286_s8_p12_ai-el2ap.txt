In addition to these issues, Turkey has experienced various macroeconomic
shocks over the past decade, which have adversely affected the
value of the Turkish Lira and contributed to inflationary pressures.
Preventing such shocks is essential for Turkey to mitigate the
risk of further macroeconomic instability. As a result of these
challenges, Turkey has been unable to attract the anticipated levels
of foreign direct investment (FDI). Furthermore, following the failed military
coup and terrorist attacks in July 2016, credit rating agencies
such as S&P, Moodyâ€™s, and Fitch assigned Turkey a low
risk rating.
