Following the initial evolutionary analysis, we examined all variable sites
identified among the 70 ACE2 orthologues. From these, we selected
30 variable sites that have been reported as functionally relevant
and/or implicated in the interaction between host ACE2 and SARS-CoV-like
viruses (Towler et al., 2004; Li et al., 2005a, 2020;
Luan et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2020). Figure 2
presents the amino acid residues observed at these 30 selected
variable sites across the ACE2 orthologues of 70 placental mammal
species. Among these sites, three (positions 24, 34, and 559)
were identified as targets of positive selection according to the
Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) analysis (Table S3). The phylogenetic topology
depicted in Figure 2 is consistent with the established relationships
among the major taxonomic groups analyzed. For instance, Homo sapiens
and other great apes (family Hominoidea) exhibit identical amino acids
at all 30 positions, with the only observed difference from
Cercopithecidae species occurring at the positively selected site 559, which
involves a conservative amino acid substitution (R559K; GS = 26)
(Figure 2).
