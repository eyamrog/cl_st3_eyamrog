The genomic sequence of the novel coronavirus was rapidly determined
with the support of public health authorities and the online
community resource virological.org on January 10th (Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank accession number
MN908947), followed by the deposition of four additional genomes on
January 12th in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza
Data (GISAID) database. Initial clinical signs and symptoms indicated the
presence of a virus closely related to the SARS coronavirus
responsible for the 2002/2003 outbreak. This viral species also includes
numerous viruses previously detected in rhinolophid bats in Asia and
Europe. Subsequent sequencing revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 genome shares 96.2%
identity with Bat RaTG13 CoV and 79.5% identity with SARS-CoV.
These genomic similarities suggest that bats are the natural reservoir
of the virus, and that SARS-CoV-2 may have been transmitted
to humans via one or more unidentified intermediate hosts. Multiple
studies support the hypothesis that bats serve as the primary
reservoir for SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, there is evidence indicating that the
initial outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was associated with the seafood market
in Wuhan, China. Coronaviruses of the α- and β-genera are
capable of infecting mammals, whereas γ- and δ-coronaviruses primarily infect
birds. Of the six coronaviruses previously identified as capable of
infecting humans, most exhibit low pathogenicity and cause mild respiratory
symptoms similar to the common cold; however, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
are associated with severe and potentially fatal respiratory tract infections.
