During the 6.5-year study period, mortality (Mdn = 9.19%) was
significantly higher than recruitment (Mdn = 0%) among early-successional plants
with a diameter at breast height (dbh) greater than 2.5
cm (Mann-Whitney Test, U = 18, p = 0.007), while
no significant difference was observed between mortality and recruitment rates
in early-successional plants with a dbh less than 2.5 cm.
In late-successional plants with a dbh greater than 2.5 cm,
there was no significant difference between mortality (7.67 ± 1.24%)
and recruitment (5.53 ± 1.26%) rates (t test, t =
1.21, p = 0.24). However, late-successional plants with a dbh
less than 2.5 cm exhibited significantly higher recruitment (Mdn =
20.0%) compared to mortality (Mdn = 7.14%) (Mann-Whitney Test, U
= 16, p = 0.026) over the same period.
