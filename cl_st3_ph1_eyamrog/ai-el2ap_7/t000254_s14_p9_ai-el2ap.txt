Data Analysis â€“ Calculations were performed to quantify mortality and
recruitment rates within the plant community, as well as to
assess growth rates and the proportion of dead and recruited
basal area for individuals with a diameter at breast height
(dbh) greater than 2.5 cm over a 6.5-year period (March
2006 to September 2012). Relative growth rates and the distribution
of shrub and tree diameters were also analyzed. For basal
area dynamics, recruitment was defined as the sum of the
relative contribution to basal area from individuals newly recruited in
2012 and the relative contribution from the growth of surviving
individuals present since 2006.
