The pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, severe acute
respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2) has led to increased demand for
healthcare services, and significant uncertainties remain regarding its management. The
disease associated with this virus (COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019) is
characterized by high transmissibility and relatively low lethality, with reported
mortality rates ranging from 1% to 3.5%. It is estimated
that 15–20% of infected individuals may develop severe pneumonia, and
5–10% may require intensive care. Elderly patients and those with
comorbidities are at increased risk of mortality from COVID-19. The
current gold standard for the etiological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection
is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) performed on respiratory
tract specimens.
