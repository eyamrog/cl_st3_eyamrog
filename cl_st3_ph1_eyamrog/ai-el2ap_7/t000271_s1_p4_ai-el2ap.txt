Although our findings are based on a convenience sample, they
are consistent with several established observations: an increasing trend over
time, which aligns with the ongoing rise of the epidemic
curve in the state; a higher prevalence among younger individuals,
who are more likely to be mobile; and a higher
prevalence among those with lower educational attainment, who may face
greater challenges in adhering to social distancing recommendations. Despite the
limitations of the study, the results suggest that protective levels
of natural herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been
achieved in Rio de Janeiro. Key words: COVID-19, Blood donors,
