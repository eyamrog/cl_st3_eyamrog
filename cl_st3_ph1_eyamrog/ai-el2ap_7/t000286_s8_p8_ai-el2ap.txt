Foreign direct investment (FDI) is widely recognized as a mechanism
that can support economic development. Consequently, countries implement policies to
foster an environment conducive to investment in order to enhance
FDI inflows. Since 2006, Turkey, as a developing country, has
introduced measures aimed at attracting high-quality investment to improve economic
efficiency. Additionally, it is well established that developing countries frequently
experience constraints related to insufficient capital inflows.
