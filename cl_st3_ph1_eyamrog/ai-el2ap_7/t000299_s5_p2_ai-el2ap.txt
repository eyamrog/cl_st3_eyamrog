Various disinfection methods are available for pacifier decontamination, including antimicrobial
solutions—such as chemical agents (chlorhexidine, triclosan, cetylpyridinium chloride, Listerine, and
several dentifrices) and natural agents (garlic and tea tree oil
extracts)—as well as radiation-based techniques (microwave and ultraviolet rays), similar
to those used for toothbrush disinfection [18]. However, the literature
reports varying levels of effectiveness for these methods, with only
some demonstrating significant efficacy. Therefore, this systematic review was conducted
to assess whether a consensus exists in the literature regarding
pacifier disinfection methods and to identify any method that consistently
meets the expected outcomes by systematically evaluating all suggested approaches.
