The water quality of Garças Reservoir exhibited temporal variation over
the study period. Between 1997 and 1999, the reservoir remained
in eutrophic to supereutrophic conditions, with Trophic State Index (TSI)
values ranging from 59.1 to 67.0, excluding Secchi disk (SD)
measurements. From 2000 to 2011, the reservoir was classified as
hypereutrophic, with TSI values equal to or greater than 67.0
(without SD). Between 2011 and 2017, the system reverted to
a supereutrophic state, with the exception of 2013 (see Figure
2). Beginning in 2000, the influence of Secchi disk depth
on the overall TSI increased, but this influence diminished again
during the final three years of the study (2015–2017) (see
Figure 2).
