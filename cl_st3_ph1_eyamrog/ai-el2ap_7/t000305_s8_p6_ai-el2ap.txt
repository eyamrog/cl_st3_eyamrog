A treatment that enhances the innate immune response is expected
to increase the efficiency of the immune system immediately upon
viral entry into the bloodstream. Therefore, it is essential to
assess the quality of both individual and population-level innate immune
responses. In this context, the authors have analyzed the relationship
between the epidemiological stage of the pandemic in various countries
and their BCG (Bacillus Calmette–Guérin) vaccination status, given that BCG
vaccination primarily functions by activating or training innate immunity.
