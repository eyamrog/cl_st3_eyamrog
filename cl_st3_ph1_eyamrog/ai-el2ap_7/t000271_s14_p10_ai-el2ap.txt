Serum or plasma samples that tested positive for antibodies (IgM,
IgG, or both IgG and IgM) were subsequently analyzed for
the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (qRT-PCR) with the Molecular IDT Integrated DNA Technologies
SARS-CoV-2 N1/N2/P assay (Promega, Madison, USA).
