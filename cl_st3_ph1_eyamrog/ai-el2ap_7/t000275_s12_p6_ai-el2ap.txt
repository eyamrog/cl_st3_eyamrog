An alternative method for implementing the smoke evacuation suction circuit,
in the absence of the previously described chemical substances, involves
attaching a ventilation machine filter to the distal end of
the suction tubing connected to the surgical trocar. The outlet
of the filter is subsequently connected to a second plastic
suction tube, which channels the evacuated smoke into a water
seal device containing saline solution.
