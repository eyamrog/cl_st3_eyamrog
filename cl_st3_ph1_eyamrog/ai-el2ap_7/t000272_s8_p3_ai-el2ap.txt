Numerous studies have investigated the use of bioactive compounds and
medicinal plants (Lima et al. 2014; Macedo-Costa et al. 2017;
Veloso et al. 2020; Sette-de-Souza et al. 2014; Silva et
al. 2012). Within this context, Schinopsis brasiliensis Engl. is traditionally
used in folk medicine for the treatment of various conditions,
including toothache, diarrhea, influenza, and inflammation (Agra et al. 2006;
Albuquerque 2006; Albuquerque et al. 2007; Albuquerque et al. 2012).
The bark of S. brasiliensis contains polyphenols, flavonoids, tannins, and
saponins (Chaves et al. 2015; Fernandes et al. 2015), and
several biologically active compounds have been isolated from this species
(Cardoso et al. 2005; Cardoso et al. 2015; Santos et
al. 2017). Santos et al. (2014) identified the presence of
flavonoids and tannins in the hydroalcoholic extract of S. brasiliensis
bark and reported an absence of toxicity. Furthermore, these phenolic
compounds are susceptible to degradation at temperatures above 125 Â°C
(Fernandes et al. 2013).
