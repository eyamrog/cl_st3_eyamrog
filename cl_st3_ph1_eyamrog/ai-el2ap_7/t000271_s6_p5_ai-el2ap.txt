To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the
first large-scale seroprevalence survey of SARS-CoV-2 infection among asymptomatic individuals
in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. While the survey sample was
not randomly selected from the general population, it includes a
demographically and socially diverse group of healthy participants, thereby enabling
a preliminary assessment of antibody prevalence in asymptomatic individuals. The
prevalence estimates reported in this study have been adjusted for
the sensitivity and specificity of the serological test used and
weighted according to the age and sex distribution of the
population, providing a more accurate representation of antibody prevalence at
the population level.
