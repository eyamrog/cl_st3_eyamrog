The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (previously referred to as 2019-nCoV) is
a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family. Estimates
of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) for the four
coronavirus genera within this family range from approximately 10,000 years
to several million years (Wertheim et al., 2013). In contrast,
SARS-CoV-2, which is currently the most extensively studied member of
the Coronaviridae family, has a much more recent origin. Based
on genomic sequences from various SARS-CoV-2 strains and an estimated
annual mutation rate of 1.24 × 10⁻³ substitutions per site,
Li et al. (2020a) estimated that the virus originated on
November 24, 2019.
