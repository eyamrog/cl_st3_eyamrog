All tests were conducted in accordance with the manufacturerâ€™s instructions,
utilizing the MDX Instrument from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) for RNA
extraction and the Applied Biosystems MDX thermocycler from Thermo Fisher
Scientific (Waltham, USA) for amplification. To estimate the specificity of
the MedTest, 100 plasma samples were obtained from the Hemorio
blood donor repository, collected in 2018, prior to the emergence
of the novel coronavirus pandemic. All donors of these samples
had previously tested negative for the infectious disease markers required
for blood donation. Additionally, 20 donor samples from 2018, each
positive for a single infection marker (anti-HIV, anti-HCV, or HBsAg),
were also tested.
