Chlorhexidine solution (0.12%) has been proposed for various applications, including
the disinfection of toothbrushes and the elimination of microorganisms on
pacifiers [3,9-11,28,29]. However, its use remains controversial, primarily due to
its higher cost compared to alternative disinfection solutions. These cost-related
disadvantages may restrict its widespread adoption, particularly among low-income populations
[8,25].
