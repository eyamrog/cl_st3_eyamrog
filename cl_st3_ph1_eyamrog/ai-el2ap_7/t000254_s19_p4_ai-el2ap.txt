A total of 155 individuals representing 42 species sampled in
the shrub-tree synusia were classified as belonging to the early-successional
group, while 550 individuals representing 83 species were classified as
belonging to the late-successional group (Table 1). Two fern specimens
and one Myrtaceae specimen with a diameter at breast height
(dbh) greater than 2.5 cm, which were dead and lacked
sufficient material for species-level identification, were not classified or included
in this count.
