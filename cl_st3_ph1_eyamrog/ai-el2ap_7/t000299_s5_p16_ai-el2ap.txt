The quality assessment of the included studies indicates an overall
good quality, as none demonstrated a high risk of bias.
However, future research should improve the evaluation of control groups,
given that three studies did not use sterile water as
a control. Despite this limitation, all studies were appropriate for
the analysis of pacifier disinfection methods, as each investigated different
types of disinfection techniques.
