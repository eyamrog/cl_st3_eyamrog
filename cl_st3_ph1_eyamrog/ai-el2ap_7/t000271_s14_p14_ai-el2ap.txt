For the statistical analysis, two outcomes were evaluated: the unadjusted
prevalence and the weighted prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody test positivity.
The analysis included the following variables: sex, age group (18–29,
30–49, 50+ years), blood donation site (Hemorio, churches, condominiums), education
level (no college education, college education), and place of residence
(capital city or other municipalities within the State of Rio
de Janeiro). To assess potential temporal trends, test dates were
grouped into three periods: April 14–18, April 19–23, and April
24–27.
