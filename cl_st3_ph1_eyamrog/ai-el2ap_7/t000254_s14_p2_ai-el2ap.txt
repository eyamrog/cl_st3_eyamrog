The PEFI is recognized as the third-largest state park in
the SÃ£o Paulo Metropolitan Region and is the largest park
within the metropolis whose surroundings are entirely urbanized and which
contains remnants of the Atlantic Rain Forest (SMA 2008). Approximately
70% of its 495 hectares, as defined by current boundaries
(CONDEPHAAT 2018), is covered by forest remnants, with the predominant
vegetation classified as regenerating Dense Montane Ombrophilous Forest at various
successional stages (Barros et al. 2002). The forest is secondary
and has experienced disturbance, currently undergoing a prolonged recovery process
(Peccinini & Pivello 2002). Historically, the area was divided among
12 lots owned by farmers and ranchers, with expropriation beginning
in 1893. Due to its isolation within one of the
largest metropolitan regions globally, the park is subject to disturbances
such as edge effects, biological invasions, pollution, fires, and the
heat island effect (Struffaldi-De-Vuono 1985; Gomes et al. 2003; SMA
2008).
