The term “pacifier” was combined with other relevant keywords, resulting
in the identification of 121 articles across all databases. After
the removal of duplicate records, 56 articles containing at least
one of the predefined keywords in their title or abstract
were selected for further review. These articles underwent an initial
screening based on their summaries, the disinfection methods employed, and
the relevance of their results, which led to the selection
of 11 studies. A subsequent full-text review was conducted to
assess compliance with the established inclusion and exclusion criteria, ultimately
yielding 8 articles for analysis. Figure 1 presents a flowchart
outlining the processes of study identification, selection, eligibility assessment, and
inclusion.
