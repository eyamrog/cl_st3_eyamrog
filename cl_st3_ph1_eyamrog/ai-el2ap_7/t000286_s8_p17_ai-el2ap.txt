The results of the Granger causality test indicated that FDI
inflows and GDP influenced the Turkish economy in distinct ways,
with both variables experiencing a decline during the study period.
Despite this decline, the findings demonstrated that tourism income remains
a significant source of revenue for Turkey. Similarly, Dinçer (2015)
analyzed the impact of monetary policies and the real effective
exchange rate (REER) during the 2000s to examine macroeconomic dynamics
in the Turkish economy. Dinçer concluded that currency volatility in
Turkey decreased following recent financial sector regulations. Furthermore, Dinçer noted
that the tourism sector’s contribution and added value to the
national economy played a significant role in this trend, as
tourism is a major sector open to international markets and
has a strong capacity to attract foreign currency.
