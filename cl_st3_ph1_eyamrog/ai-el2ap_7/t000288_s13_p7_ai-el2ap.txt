Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs predominantly among individuals with close
contact, such as family members, relatives, and friends, including those
who are in contact with infected or asymptomatic individuals. As
an emerging acute respiratory infectious disease, COVID-19 is primarily transmitted
via respiratory tract pathways, including droplets, respiratory secretions, and direct
contact, and can occur even at low infectious doses. Additionally,
the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in fecal and blood samples suggests
the potential for multiple routes of transmission.
