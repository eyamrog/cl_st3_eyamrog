Subsequent publications were produced without a coordinated organizational framework. In
1990, the "Flora Criptog√¢mica do Parque Estadual das Fontes do
Ipiranga" (Cryptogamic Flora of the Ipiranga Sources State Park) was
established and structured into three sections: (1) algae, (2) fungi
and lichens, and (3) bryophytes. The information presented below summarizes
the findings from 28 years of research dedicated to surveying
the algal flora of the Parque Estadual das Fontes do
Ipiranga (PEFI).
