SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent responsible for the ongoing pandemic
of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Chan et al., 2020; Coronaviridae
Study Group, 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Wang et al.,
2020). COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December
2019 and subsequently spread globally, exhibiting a high transmission rate,
with thousands of confirmed cases and numerous fatalities reported between
December 2019 and April 2020; these figures have continued to
increase. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO)
officially classified COVID-19 as a pandemic, marking the first instance
of a coronavirus-induced pandemic (WHO, situation report, March 11, 2020).
SARS-CoV-2 induces a severe respiratory syndrome in humans and is
transmitted through multiple potential routes, including fomites, airborne particles, and
the fecal-oral pathway, with both zoonotic (animal-to-human) and human-to-human transmission
documented (Chan et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Li
et al., 2020b). This transmission pattern is similar to that
observed in SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus) and MERS-CoV
(Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus), which were initially transmitted to
humans via the palm civet (Paguma larvata; Kan et al.,
2005) and the dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius; Zaki et al.,
2012), respectively. SARS-CoV-2 is classified within the Betacoronavirus genus, subgenus
Sarbecovirus, and shares approximately 70% genomic similarity with SARS-CoV (Wu
et al., 2020). Comparative genetic analyses have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2
is highly similar to coronaviruses found in bats (Rhinolophus affinis)
(Guo et al., 2020; Ji et al., 2020; Li et
al., 2020b; Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020).
Additional genomic comparisons have identified local sequence similarities between human
SARS-CoV-2 and coronaviruses from other animals, including snakes, turtles, pangolins,
and minks, suggesting these species as potential intermediate hosts (Guo
et al., 2020; Ji et al., 2020; Li et al.,
2020c; Liu et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2020; Wu
et al., 2020). Recent metagenomic studies provide further evidence that
pangolins (Manis javanica) may serve as the most plausible intermediate
hosts for SARS-CoV-2-related viruses, with findings indicating that these viruses
were acquired independently from bats or other animal hosts (Lam
et al., 2020). The detection of putative recombination events among
pangolin, bat, and human coronaviruses underscores the complexity of the
evolutionary origins of SARS-CoV-2 (Lam et al., 2020). Despite ongoing
uncertainties regarding the definitive original and intermediate hosts, current evidence
suggests that mutation and/or recombination among coronaviruses has facilitated cross-species
transmission (Letko et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2020).
