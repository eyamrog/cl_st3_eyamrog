To evaluate prognosis, analyses will be conducted in accordance with
the recommendations of Cochrane and the Cochrane Prognosis Methods Group.
Meta-analyses will be performed using R software. For outcomes measured
as continuous variables, analyses will be conducted using mean difference
(MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD), such as Hedges’ or
Cohen’s methods. For dichotomous outcomes, hazard ratios (either unadjusted or
adjusted) or odds ratios, along with their standard errors, will
be pooled for endpoints including hospital admission, intensive care unit
admission, respiratory support for adult inpatients with COVID-19, and mortality.
Additional parameters, such as standard deviations (for MD or SMD)
and event counts (for risk ratios or odds ratios), will
also be pooled as appropriate. All analyses will employ the
generic inverse variance method with a random-effects model. The “meta”
package (version 4.11-0) in R will be used for these
analyses.
