The rate of increase in the number of deaths by
day 30 (D30) in countries classified as group 1 remained
four times higher than that observed in groups 2 and
2a. It is anticipated that the use of acceleration indices
as the basis for this analysis will continue to yield
statistically significant results in subsequent evaluations scheduled for May 21
and June 21. The primary objective of these future analyses
is to further assess the hypothesis that the BCG vaccination
program may confer a protective effect, particularly among unvaccinated individuals
and populations at elevated risk for developing severe COVID-19. This
investigation is especially relevant given the current absence of a
specific vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
