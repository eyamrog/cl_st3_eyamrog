Viruses are complex pathogens capable of infecting multiple host species
and causing a wide range of diseases with diverse symptoms.
Coronaviruses (CoVs), classified as pleomorphic RNA viruses within the subgenus
Sarbecovirus and subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, exhibit a high rate of genetic
recombination, primarily due to frequent errors during RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRP)-mediated replication. The replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2 involves several key
steps: initial recognition and binding to the host cell, entry
via membrane fusion or endocytosis, release of the viral genome,
translation of viral polymerase proteins, RNA replication, subgenomic transcription, translation
of structural proteins, assembly of structural proteins with the nucleocapsid,
formation of mature virions, and release of these virions through
exocytosis. Upon completion of this cycle, newly formed virions are
released and can infect additional host cells, thereby perpetuating the
infection cycle. Approximately two-thirds of the viral RNA genome encodes
16 non-structural proteins (NSPs), while the remaining one-third encodes four
essential structural proteins—spike glycoprotein (S), small envelope protein (E), matrix
protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N)—as well as several accessory
proteins.
