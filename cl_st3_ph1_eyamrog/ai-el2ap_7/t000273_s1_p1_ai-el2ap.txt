The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
and its association with severe pneumonia and increased mortality have
highlighted deficiencies in health systems globally. While the primary focus
has been on the care of hospitalized patients, it is
also essential to strengthen Primary Health Care (PHC) interventions. PHC
serves as the initial point of contact with the health
system in many countries, including Brazil, and is integral to
the prevention, protection, promotion, and treatment of health at both
individual and community levels. Brazil, similar to other nations, has
confronted significant challenges during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Given Brazilâ€™s universal
and decentralized health system, in which PHC functions as the
foundational model for health system organization, this article examines the
critical importance of reinforcing PHC in Brazil during the coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
