The literature contains numerous studies examining the impact of FDI
inflows on the real effective exchange rate in Turkey. For
analytical clarity, these studies can be categorized into four main
groups: those addressing the relationship between FDI inflows and the
exchange rate; those focusing on financial stress; those exploring financial
crises, including analyses of macroprudential policy and purchasing power parity;
and those investigating the effects of tourism on Turkeyâ€™s real
GDP.
