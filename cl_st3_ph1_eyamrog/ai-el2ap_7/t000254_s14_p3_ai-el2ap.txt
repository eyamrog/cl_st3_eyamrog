The flora of the park has been documented in a
series of monographs by the Botanical Institute (Barros et al.
2002), which is located within the park and houses one
of the largest herbaria in the country. The park also
contains one of the oldest meteorological stations in the country,
which has conducted uninterrupted measurements since 1932. A comparison of
climate normals from 1933–1960 and 1991–2017 indicates a local increase
of approximately 1.7 °C in average annual temperature and an
increase of 320.1 mm in average annual rainfall (EM-IAG 2017).
The mean annual temperature for the period 1933–2017 is 18.7
°C, with average monthly temperatures ranging from 15.3 °C in
July to 21.9 °C in February. The mean total annual
precipitation is 1,412.3 mm, with more than half of this
amount occurring between December and March (EM-IAG 2017).
