Participants engaging in at least 30 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical
activity (MVPA) per day exhibited lower odds of prevalent depressive
symptoms (OR=0.71, 95% CI=0.53–0.96), anxiety symptoms (OR=0.72, 95% CI=0.54–0.96), and
co-occurring depressive and anxiety symptoms (OR=0.71, 95% CI=0.52–0.96) after adjustment
for potential covariates. In contrast, individuals reporting sedentary behavior (SB)
of 10 or more hours per day had higher odds
of prevalent depressive symptoms (OR=1.39, 95% CI=1.02–1.90) in the fully
adjusted models. Detailed results from the logistic regression analyses are
provided in Table 2. Additionally, linear regression models adjusting for
relevant covariates indicate that each additional hour spent in SB
is associated with a 0.22-point increase on the Beck Depression
Inventory (BDI; 95% CI=0.104–0.338) and a 0.16-point increase on the
Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI; 95% CI=0.021–0.313). The results of the
linear models for MVPA and SB are presented in Table
3.
