In this context, it is recommended to consult and implement
the most recent protocols and guidelines issued by local dental
organizations, which are informed by current scientific literature. The COVID-19
pandemic presents significant challenges to dental health care providers, affecting
both clinical practice and financial stability. A general flowchart (Figure
1) was developed based on the American Dental Associationâ€™s (ADA)
Interim Guidance on minimizing COVID-19 transmission risk during the management
of dental emergencies. As noted in the ADA document, Figure
1 is not intended to serve as legal advice or
legal guidance, but rather as a tool to assist clinicians
in exercising their professional judgment regarding infection risks in dental
settings.
