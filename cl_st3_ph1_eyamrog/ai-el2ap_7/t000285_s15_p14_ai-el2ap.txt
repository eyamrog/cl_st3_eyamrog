To evaluate the feasibility of conducting a meta-analysis, we will
extract the following data for each primary and secondary outcome
measure: (a) the total number of patients in each group;
(b) the number of events in each group for dichotomous
outcomes; (c) the mean, standard deviation, standard error, median, interquartile
range, minimum, maximum, and 95% confidence interval for continuous outcomes;
and (d) the p-value.
