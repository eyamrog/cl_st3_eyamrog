The data presented above were analyzed using multiple regression techniques
with the aid of E-Views software to manage the data
volume and enhance computational accuracy. To examine the relationship between
poverty and inflation in Turkey, the data were subjected to
a Unit Root test, Johansen Co-integration test, Vector Error Correction
Model, and Granger Causality Test. The variables considered in this
study include the poverty rate as the dependent variable and
inflation as the independent variable. The empirical results generated from
these analyses are presented below.
