A robust primary care system has the potential to reduce
unnecessary hospital admissions, thereby alleviating pressure on hospitals, increasing bed
availability for patients with COVID-19, and contributing to the financial
sustainability of the health system. Between 2010 and 2016, over
23,000 hospitalizations for conditions sensitive to primary care were avoided
in Brazil, resulting in cost savings of approximately US$ 6.1
million for the public health sector.
