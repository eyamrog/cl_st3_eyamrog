We also analyzed intra-specific variation in the ACE2 gene using
data from human populations available in the 1000 Genomes Project,
accessed via the Ensembl and UNIPROT platforms. This dataset identified
660 missense variants (all with a minor allele frequency of
0.005 or less), 260 synonymous variants, 14,352 intron variants, 67
variants in the 5’ untranslated region (UTR), and 268 variants
in the 3’ UTR of the ACE2 gene in humans.
Many of these variants have been examined in case-control or
genome-wide association studies related to cardiovascular diseases and other associated
conditions (e.g., Ji et al., 2017). Among the 30 ACE2
binding sites selected for this study (Figure 2), only one
site, at position 26, exhibits two segregating alleles (K and
R; minor allele frequency = 0.002; rs4646116). Although population-level data
are not available for the other species included in this
study, our results indicate that there is no significant polymorphism
at the 30 sites mediating the interaction between host ACE2
and SARS-CoV-like viruses in Homo sapiens, the most extensively studied
species. This observation supports the conclusion that the amino acids
shown in Figure 2 are taxon-specific, meaning they are characteristic
of a species or taxonomic group, with intra-specific variation being
absent or negligible. Furthermore, the conservation of amino acids at
these 30 sites within Homo sapiens suggests the presence of
strong evolutionary constraints, the underlying causes of which require further
investigation. Analysis of the Neanderthal (Homo neanderthalensis) and Denisovan genomes
indicates that both archaic hominins share the same amino acids
as modern humans at these 30 sites.
