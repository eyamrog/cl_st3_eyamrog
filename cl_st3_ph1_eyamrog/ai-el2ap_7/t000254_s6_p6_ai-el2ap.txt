The short stature of canopy trees in montane tropical forests
can be attributed in part to high rates of turnover
(Herwitz & Young 1994). Consistent with previous research (Condit et
al. 1996b; Machado & Oliveira-Filho 2010; Feeley et al. 2011;
Laurance et al. 2014), the smallest individuals exhibited the highest
rates of recruitment, indicating greater population dynamism in these size
classes. Conversely, the largest individuals also experienced elevated mortality rates,
a pattern similarly observed in other areas of the park
(Gomes et al. 2003). The highest mortality rates were recorded
in the smallest (<2.5 cm dbh) and largest (>5 cm
dbh) size classes, which may be explained by the increased
vulnerability of small plants to lethal damage (Salles & Schiavini
2007; Sheil et al. 2000) and the susceptibility of larger,
potentially senescent pioneer trees to competition within the community (Felfili
1995; Schorn & Galv√£o 2009). Although late-successional species are predominant
in the community and early-successional species show a marked decline,
it is not accurate to attribute overall mortality solely to
the loss of early-successional individuals, as mortality among late-successional species
also accounted for a substantial proportion of total deaths during
the study period.
