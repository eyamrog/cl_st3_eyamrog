The increasing resistance of microorganisms to antibiotics presents a significant
challenge for medicine, prompting the development of new antimicrobial therapies
with enhanced efficacy against resistant strains (Pereira et al. 2011).
As a result, research on herbal products as potential antimicrobial
agents is expanding. In the field of dentistry, such studies
primarily focus on evaluating the effects of these products on
bacteria and fungi associated with common oral diseases, including dental
caries and periodontal disease, both of which are recognized as
biofilm-dependent conditions (Lima et al. 2014; Santamaria Junior et al.
2014; Sponchiado et al. 2014).
