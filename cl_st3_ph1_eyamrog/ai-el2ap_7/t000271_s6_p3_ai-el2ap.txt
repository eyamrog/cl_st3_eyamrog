In this context, questions regarding the appropriate timing and extent
of lifting or intensifying suppression measures have been central to
discussions among public health researchers, professionals, health authorities, and the
broader community. One potential criterion for informing these decisions is
the level of herd immunity achieved within the population. Estimates
suggest that approximately 60% herd immunity may be necessary, based
on current calculations of the basic reproduction number for the
infection [22]. In the absence of an available vaccine against
COVID-19, achieving this level of herd immunity would require widespread
natural infection. However, in settings such as Rio de Janeiro,
where the health care system is at risk of imminent
collapse, pursuing natural herd immunity is not a viable strategy,
as it would necessitate relaxing current suppression measures and would
likely result in a substantial increase in COVID-19-related mortality. Conversely,
maintaining effective and prolonged suppression measures may impede the development
of herd immunity, complicate the implementation of exit strategies, and
increase the risk of subsequent epidemic waves [23].
