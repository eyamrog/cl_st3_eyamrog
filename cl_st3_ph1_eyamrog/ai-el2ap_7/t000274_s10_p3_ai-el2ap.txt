The establishment of a definitive airway is inherently associated with
aerosol generation, particularly when high-speed flow is utilized. Therefore, it
is essential to implement appropriate safety measures to minimize the
risk of disease transmission. Positive pressure ventilation during non-invasive ventilation
(NIV), as well as the use of face masks or
supraglottic devices, are considered high-risk factors for aerosol generation due
to their inadequate sealing, which is less effective compared to
a definitive airway secured with an inflated cuff within the
trachea.
