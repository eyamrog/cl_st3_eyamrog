When using boiled water, some studies achieved complete disinfection of
pacifier surfaces within 15 minutes [8,10] and as quickly as
5 minutes [15]. These findings are consistent with the results
of a systematic review and meta-analysis, which confirmed that the
use of boiled drinking water is effective in inactivating pathogens
across various organism groups [24].
