Our comparative analysis of the ACE2 coding region in 70
placental mammal species identified numerous variable sites, of which 30
were selected based on their documented relevance to interactions with
SARS-CoV-like S glycoproteins. Among these, three sites exhibited significant evidence
of positive (Darwinian) selection. The ACE2 coding region demonstrated high
conservation within Homo sapiens and comparatively greater variation among placental
mammals. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 possesses a similar capacity
to infect all human populations, consistent with the global spread
of COVID-19. Therefore, observed differences in infection and mortality rates
among human populations are likely attributable to factors such as
individual comorbidities, cultural practices, population density, healthcare system capacity, public
health interventions, variation in SARS-CoV-2 strains, and the effectiveness of
innate immune responses. The potential involvement of additional genetic pathways
beyond ACE2 and the immune system cannot be excluded, but
further research is required to identify these factors and clarify
their roles in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
