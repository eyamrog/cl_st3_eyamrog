In conclusion, computed tomography (CT) demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy for
the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection and may be effectively integrated
as a triage tool in resource-limited settings during the pandemic
to support the efficient allocation of PCR testing, isolation beds,
and intensive care unit resources.
