A total of 129 species were identified, with 125 belonging
to the shrub-tree synusia (including one exotic species, Coffea arabica
L.), one to the hemiepiphyte synusia (Philodendron appendiculatum Nadruz &
Mayo), and three to the climber synusia (Hippocratea volubilis L.,
Salacia elliptica (Mart.) G. Don, and Machaerium brasiliense Vogel), which
had previously been classified within the shrub-tree group in 2006.
In total, 39 families were recorded, with Myrtaceae (29 species),
Lauraceae (15 species), Rubiaceae (10 species), and Fabaceae (8 species)
representing the families with the highest species richness. The collection
of both vegetative and fertile material enabled the identification of
56 species that were not listed in the Park Management
Plan (Table 2).
