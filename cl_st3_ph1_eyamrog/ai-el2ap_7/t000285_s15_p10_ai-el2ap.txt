We will conduct a comprehensive search for studies in the
following databases: Medline via PubMed, Embase via Elsevier, Cochrane Library
- Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Portal Regional
BVS - LILACS, Scopus, and Web of Science. Relevant descriptors
and synonyms will be used, and search strategies will be
adapted to the specific requirements of each database to identify
published, ongoing, and unpublished studies. In addition, we will search
COVID-19-specific databases, including the Epistemonikos COVID-19 LÂ·OVE platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and
the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO
ICTRP). The snowballing technique will also be applied by screening
the reference lists of included studies.
