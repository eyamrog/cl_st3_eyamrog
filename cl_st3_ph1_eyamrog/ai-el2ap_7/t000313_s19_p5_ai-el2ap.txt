The domestic cat (Felis catus) and dog (Canis lupus familiaris)
are of particular interest due to their close association with
humans. The ACE2 orthologues in these species exhibit 77% and
73% sequence identity, respectively, with human ACE2 across 30 variable
sites. Both species share sequence identity with other members of
the Carnivora order, such as the presence of leucine (L)
at position 24. However, they differ from each other at
positions 25, 34, 427, and 559, with positions 34 and
559 identified as targets of positive selection (Table S3). Thus,
50% of the differences in ACE2 binding sites between cats
and dogs represent taxon-specific variants, which may be associated with
distinct functional adaptations of the ACE2 protein in each species.
