A comparison of the dynamics between the two successional plant
groups with diameters at breast height (dbh) greater than 2.5
cm indicated that annual mortality rates did not significantly differ
between early-successional and late-successional plants (Mann-Whitney test, U = 45,
p = 0.73; Table 4). In contrast, annual recruitment was
significantly higher in late-successional plants compared to early-successional plants (U
= 22, p = 0.02; Figure 5).
