The results of this study should be interpreted with caution.
Despite the demographic and social diversity of the sample, it
was a convenience sample, which may introduce bias and limit
the generalizability of the findings to the entire population of
the State of Rio de Janeiro, including individuals aged 18â€“69
years. Additionally, the study population was not selected to provide
region-specific estimates within the State, and substantial variation in infection
prevalence is likely to exist across different geographical areas of
the city.
