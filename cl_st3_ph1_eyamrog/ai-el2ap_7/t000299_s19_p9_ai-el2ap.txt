Chlorhexidine 0.12% has been shown to be effective in removing
Staphylococcus epidermidis and Candida parapsilosis [11], Candida albicans [9], and
Streptococcus mutans [3,9,14]. Previous studies recommend the use of chlorhexidine
0.12% as an antimicrobial agent for disinfecting pacifiers, with application
by spraying identified as a suitable method [10].
