The primary objective at this time is to ensure the
safety of both patients and healthcare workers. Current recommendations are
predominantly based on expert opinion and are subject to rapid
revision as the outbreak is anticipated to intensify in the
coming weeks. A recent report from Wuhan, China, documented the
outcomes of 34 patients who underwent elective surgical procedures during
the incubation period of COVID-19 in the early phase of
the outbreak. All patients developed COVID-19 pneumonia shortly after surgery;
15 patients (44.1%) required admission to the intensive care unit,
and 7 patients (20.5%) died.
