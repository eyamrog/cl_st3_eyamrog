Although the studied area demonstrates progress toward an advanced stage
of regeneration, targeted studies are required to directly evaluate the
influence of the factors identified here on forest dynamics. In
the case of an isolated forest fragment such as the
one examined in this study, located within a highly urbanized
environment and lacking nearby forested areas, a gradual loss of
species over time would generally be expected (Turner et al.
1995, Turner 1996). However, the specific local history (Chazdon et
al. 2007, Norden et al. 2009), increased protective measures against
the removal of flora and fauna, reduced incidence of fire,
and particularly the cessation of emissions from the adjacent steel
mill have contributed to the regeneration of the vegetation cover,
as observed in another section of the Park (Gomes et
al. 2003). Despite its isolation and the surrounding urban landscape,
this remnant serves as a significant source of propagules, provides
habitat for various endangered species, and delivers essential ecosystem services.
These factors underscore the ecological importance of this urban forest
fragment in the context of ongoing anthropogenic pressures. Continuous monitoring
of the plant community and populations within this and other
areas of the fragment, including climbing plants, may help elucidate
the relationship between diversity, ecosystem resilience, and local factors influencing
forest health.
