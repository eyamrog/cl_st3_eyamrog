Strategies to promote moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) should be tailored
to the current context, considering both the ongoing response to
COVID-19 and efforts to mitigate its future impacts on mental
health. While existing evidence suggests that exercise may reduce the
severity of acute respiratory symptoms in the general population, there
are currently no studies evaluating the protective effects or safety
of exercise specifically in individuals with COVID-19 infection. At present,
it is advisable for exercise professionals to remain vigilant for
potential signs of COVID-19 infection among participants. Accordingly, a brief
screening for COVID-19 symptoms may be warranted prior to engaging
in MVPA. If signs or symptoms of infection are identified,
individuals should abstain from MVPA and adhere to recommendations provided
by local health authorities.
