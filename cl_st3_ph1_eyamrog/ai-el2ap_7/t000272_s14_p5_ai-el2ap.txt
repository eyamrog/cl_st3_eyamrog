The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined according to the
guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, 2009).
The microbial inoculum was prepared by suspending cells in 5
mL of 0.9% sterile saline solution and adjusting the turbidity
to 10^6 colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) using a
spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-mini 1240, São Paulo, Brazil) at 625 nm.
The test extract and fractions were dissolved in 10% dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO; Merck, Darmstadt, Hessen, Germany). Each fraction or extract
was prepared at a concentration of 500 mg/mL and serially
diluted in brain heart infusion broth (BHI; Difco, Detroit, MI,
USA) in a 96-well plate (TPP, Trasadingen, Switzerland), with 0.12%
chlorhexidine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) serving as the positive
control. Ten microliters of the standardized microbial suspension were added
to each well. The plates were incubated at 37 ±
0.5 °C for 24 hours. Bacterial growth was assessed by
adding 20 µL of 0.01% aqueous resazurin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA) followed by incubation at 37 ± 0.5 °C
for two hours. The MIC was defined as the lowest
concentration of the test substance that prevented a color change
of resazurin, indicating inhibition of bacterial growth.
