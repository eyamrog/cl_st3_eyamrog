In this study, we expanded the comparative analysis to include
a broader range of species and additional sites of interaction
between ACE2 orthologues and SARS-CoV-like viruses. Our results indicate that
murine ACE2 shares only 56% sequence identity with human ACE2
and exhibits several critical taxon-specific amino acid substitutions that likely
contribute to the observed resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection in these
species. For the other species and taxa examined, however, the
capacity of ACE2 to mediate or inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection remains
difficult to predict based solely on sequence variation. Preliminary data
suggest that the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), when experimentally infected
with SARS-CoV-2, develops moderate respiratory disease similar to that observed
in most human cases (Munster et al., 2020). Notably, Macaca
mulatta, like other members of the family Cercopithecidae, differs from
humans and other Hominidae (Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus, and Gorilla
gorilla) by only a single amino acid substitution (R559K; see
Figure 2). Additionally, we identified a set of amino acid
changes in the ACE2 of New World monkey (NWM) species,
which may result in altered binding patterns to SARS-CoV-2 and
potentially confer reduced susceptibility compared to humans and great apes.
Although a previous in vivo study (Greenough et al., 2005)
reported SARS-CoV infection outcomes in Callithrix species, the dynamics of
viral replication and the risk of natural infection in this
and other NWM species remain uncharacterized. Consequently, while Callithrix species
have been established as suitable models for MERS-CoV infection (McAuliffe
et al., 2004; Van Doremalen and Munster, 2015), they have
not been validated as animal models for SARS-CoV infection. It
is important to note that MERS-CoV utilizes a different host-cell
entry receptor, DPP4, rather than ACE2.
