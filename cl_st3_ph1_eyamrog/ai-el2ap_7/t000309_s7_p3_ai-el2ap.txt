Digestive symptoms have been reported in approximately half of patients
with COVID-19, with diarrhea and fever occurring alongside respiratory symptoms.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool samples and other
clinical specimens has increased attention to the management of patients
with pre-existing digestive diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),
and to the potential for fecal-oral transmission of the virus.
After infection, SARS-CoV-2-specific RNA and proteins are synthesized in the
cytoplasm, leading to the assembly of new virions. The presence
of viral RNA in fecal samples for 1 to 12
days after respiratory samples have tested negative indicates that viruses
may continue to be secreted from infected gastrointestinal cells. Furthermore,
the duration of viral shedding in pediatric feces is longer
than in adults. These findings indicate that the inflamed gastrointestinal
tract in both adults and children with IBD may be
more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it may serve as
an entry point for the virus.
