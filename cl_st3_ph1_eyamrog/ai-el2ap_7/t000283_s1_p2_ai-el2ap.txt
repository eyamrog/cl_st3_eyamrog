METHODS: This study will employ a rapid living systematic review
methodology with network meta-analysis, in accordance with the recommendations of
the Cochrane Handbook. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs assessing
single or combined pharmacological interventions at any dose for the
treatment of COVID-19 will be included. Comprehensive searches will be
conducted in Medline via PubMed, Embase via Elsevier, the Cochrane
Library (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL]), Portal Regional
BVS (LILACS), Scopus, and Web of Science to identify potentially
eligible studies. No language restrictions will be applied during study
selection. The risk of bias in included studies will be
assessed using the Risk of Bias tool, and the certainty
of evidence will be evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations
Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.
