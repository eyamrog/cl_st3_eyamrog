All extracts tested exhibited higher minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values
against the bacteria evaluated compared to the positive control, 0.12%
chlorhexidine. As noted by Castro et al. (2009), this difference
may be attributed to the fact that natural products contain
bioactive compounds in diluted forms, whereas chlorhexidine is a synthetic
agent with a higher concentration of active ingredients. However, it
is important to consider that chlorhexidine is associated with adverse
effects that restrict its duration of use. According to a
systematic review by Haas et al. (2014), chlorhexidine is effective
in reducing biofilm and gingivitis, but its application is recommended
only for short-term treatments due to these side effects, making
natural product-based agents more appropriate for routine use. Consequently, the
hexane fraction of the ethanolic extract (EE) of S. brasiliensis
Engl demonstrates potential for incorporation into preventive and therapeutic dental
products, given its activity against Streptococcus mitis and S. oralis,
which are involved in the initial colonization of the tooth
surface, as well as S. mutans, a primary etiological agent
in the initiation and progression of dental caries and related
diseases. Additionally, Duarte et al. (2006) have reported the efficacy
of phenolic compounds against S. mutans biofilm, providing further support
for the potential application of this extract in dental care.
