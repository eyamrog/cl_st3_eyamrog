The recent COVID-19 pandemic developed into a global public health
crisis. It is transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces and
exposure to bodily fluids from infected individuals, including saliva and
aerosols. These modes of transmission identify dental offices as high-risk
environments for cross-infection among patients, dentists, and other healthcare professionals,
including those working in hospital-based dental intensive care units. Dental
practitioners are particularly vulnerable due to their close proximity to
patients, frequent exposure to saliva and aerosols, contact with blood,
and the handling of sharp, potentially contaminated instruments.
