Trocar Placement and Pneumoperitoneum: The Veress needle puncture technique is
recommended for establishing pneumoperitoneum. Intraperitoneal pressure should be maintained at
the lowest level that is safely feasible during the initial
puncture, with subsequent pressures between 10 and 15 mmHg to
ensure adequate visualization and maintenance of the surgical field. Prior
to the insertion of any trocar, it is essential to
confirm that all valves are closed to prevent unintentional air
leakage from the pneumoperitoneum into the operating room environment.
