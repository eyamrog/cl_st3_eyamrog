Calculations to better understand the variations in the rates of
incidence and lethality curves across different countries were performed by
determining the initial acceleration (IA), expressed as cases per day
squared per 100,000 inhabitants, from the date of the first
reported case up to the 100th case, and the final
acceleration (FA), calculated from the 101st case to the number
of cases reported as of April 11, 2020 (Figs. 1–3).
The ratio of the acceleration of deaths after the 101st
case to the acceleration during the initial 0–100 cases was
then computed. This ratio is a dimensionless value, where countries
with values greater than 1 are experiencing an increasing rate
of cases, while values less than 1 indicate a decrease
in the mortality rate per 100,000 inhabitants. Only four countries—Japan,
Israel, Chile, and Hungary (Fig. 4)—had ratios less than 1,
whereas the United States exhibited the highest ratio, with an
index of 354.
