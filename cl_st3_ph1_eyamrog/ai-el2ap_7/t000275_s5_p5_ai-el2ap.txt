Recent evidence indicates that both subclinical individuals and those who
have recovered from the acute phase of the disease can
transmit the virus to others, with the risk of transmission
influenced by viral load. These findings underscore the necessity for
personal protective equipment (PPE) and stringent protocols to ensure the
safety of healthcare professionals during all stages of patient care.
It is essential that all healthcare personnel involved in the
management of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic adhere strictly to
established guidelines for hand hygiene and the use of PPE.
