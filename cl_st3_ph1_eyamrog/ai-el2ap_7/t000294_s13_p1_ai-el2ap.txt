The term "virus" is derived from Latin, meaning "poison" or
"toxin." Viruses typically range from 20 to 300 nm in
diameter and possess a genome composed of one or more
nucleic acid molecules, either DNA or RNA, which are enclosed
within a protein capsid and, in some cases, surrounded by
a lipid bilayer envelope. Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses
characterized by a distinctive replication strategy that facilitates variation in
pathogenicity and enables adaptation to diverse environments.
