Airway management should adhere to the principles of being safe,
accurate, and fast (SAF). Safety must be ensured for both
healthcare professionals and patients. Accuracy and precision are essential to
avoid the use of unreliable, unfamiliar, or repeated techniques. Timeliness
is also critical, with efforts made to minimize delays both
in the decision to perform airway management and during the
procedure itself (see Figure 1).
