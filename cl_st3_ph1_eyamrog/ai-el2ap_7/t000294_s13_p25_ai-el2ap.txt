The estimated case doubling time for Canada and the United
States up to March 24 was approximately two and a
half days. By April 7, this interval had increased to
around seven days, indicating a reduction in the rate of
case growth, although the total number of cases remained a
concern. In contrast, Colombia and Brazil exhibited different trends during
the same period, with their doubling times increasing—reflecting a slower
rate of infection—until March 29 and 30, respectively. However, by
April 3, Brazil experienced a higher transmission rate, with the
doubling interval slightly exceeding four days, highlighting the need for
strengthened containment measures to effectively limit the epidemic’s progression. By
the end of the observation period on April 18, doubling
times had generally increased across the region, indicating a further
reduction in the rate of infection. Specifically, in Mexico, Bolivia,
Peru, and Brazil, cases were projected to double in up
to eight days, while the remaining countries depicted in Figure
4 exhibited doubling intervals exceeding eleven days, reaching up to
eighteen days in Colombia.
