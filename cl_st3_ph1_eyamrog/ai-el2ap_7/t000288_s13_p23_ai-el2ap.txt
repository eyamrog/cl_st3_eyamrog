In situations where a patient requires emergency dental care, exhibits
no signs or symptoms of COVID-19, and the dentist does
not have access to an N95 or higher-level respirator, it
is recommended that the dentist use a single-use surgical mask
in combination with goggles and a face shield; however, it
should be noted that this approach carries a moderate risk
of contamination. This procedure is limited by the ongoing community
transmission of COVID-19, including the presence of asymptomatic cases. Current
evidence indicates that the prognosis of COVID-19 is poorer in
individuals over 60 years of age or those with underlying
conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, or cardiovascular disease. Therefore, healthcare
professionals must exercise clinical judgment and implement all available precautions
to minimize the risk of transmission.
