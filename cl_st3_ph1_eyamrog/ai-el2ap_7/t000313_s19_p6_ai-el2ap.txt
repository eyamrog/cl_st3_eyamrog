The five New World monkey (NWm) and Prosimian species exhibit
distinct patterns at positions 82â€“84 compared to other primates. Specifically,
they display a moderately conservative substitution at position 82 (M82T;
Grantham Score [GS] = 81), which also involves a change
in amino acid polarity. Given the prevalence of threonine at
this position across multiple species, and applying the principle of
parsimony, it is likely that threonine represents the ancestral allele.
This suggests that a non-synonymous mutation resulting in a threonine
(T) to methionine (M) substitution occurred in the ancestral lineage
of the Catarrhini clade, while the Platyrrhini ancestor retained the
ancestral threonine allele. At position 41, NWm and Prosimian species
also share the same amino acid. The substitution Y41H (GS
= 83) is moderately conservative and involves a change in
charge, as histidine is an acidic amino acid. Another mutation
at this site, Y41A (GS = 112), represents a moderately
radical change and a shift in polarity, since tyrosine is
polar and alanine is non-polar. Such alterations may reduce the
potential for viral interaction, particularly with SARS-CoV, as reported by
Li et al. (2005b). The distribution of amino acids at
position 41 of ACE2 indicates that both NWm and Prosimian
clades possess the derived histidine allele, which is also observed
in the bat genera Hipposideros and Myotis, as well as
in Equus, suggesting possible molecular convergence.
