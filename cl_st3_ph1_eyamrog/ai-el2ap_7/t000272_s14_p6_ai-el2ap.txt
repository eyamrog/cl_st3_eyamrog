The preparation of red blood cells for the cytotoxicity assay
was conducted according to the method described by Cruz-Silva et
al. (2000). Whole blood was collected from a voluntary laboratory
staff member with blood type O+ and placed in a
heparinized tube. Following centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 5 minutes,
the plasma was removed, and the erythrocytes were washed three
times with 1% saline solution. The washed erythrocytes were then
resuspended in 1% saline, and the suspension was adjusted to
a final volume corresponding to a 5% erythrocyte concentration. For
the assay, 1.5 mL of the 5% erythrocyte suspension was
mixed with 1.5 mL of the test solution at concentrations
of 1.0 mg/mL, 2.5 mg/mL, and 5.0 mg/mL in separate
tubes, and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour to
allow hemolysis. After incubation, the tubes were centrifuged at 2500
rpm for 10 minutes, and the supernatant was collected for
spectrophotometric analysis at 540 nm using a Shimadzu UV-mini 1240
spectrophotometer (Cruz-Silva et al., 2001). Turk's solution (1%) was used
as the positive control, and 1% saline solution served as
the negative control. All analyses were performed in triplicate. The
hemolytic potential (Hp) was calculated using the following equation: Hp
= [(Ae − Ab) / At] × 100, where Ae
is the absorbance of the test sample, Ab is the
absorbance of the negative control, and At is the absorbance
of the positive control.
