Similar results were observed for the weighted SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence.
The variables that were significantly associated with crude prevalence remained
significantly associated with the weighted prevalence. However, weighting the sample
resulted in stronger statistical significance for the 18–29 age group
(OR=1.86; 95% CI: 1.12–3.08), individuals with lower education levels (OR=2.11;
95% CI: 1.35–3.28), and condominium donors (OR=0.45; 95% CI: 0.23–0.86)
compared to Hemorio blood donors. The time period was also
significantly associated with the weighted prevalence (p<0.005), although the odds
ratio was slightly higher for the crude prevalence.
