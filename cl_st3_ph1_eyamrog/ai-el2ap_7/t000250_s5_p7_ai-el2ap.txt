This study has several limitations. First, the cross-sectional design precludes
any inference of causality or directionality in the observed associations.
Longitudinal research is needed to clarify the potential protective effects
of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) against the development of depression
and anxiety during self-isolation. Second, the sample predominantly consisted of
females and young adults recruited via social media platforms (Facebook,
Instagram, Twitter) and emails distributed through a network of researchers.
Although participants were drawn from 24 of the 27 Brazilian
states, the sample was heavily concentrated in Rio Grande do
Sul (62%), with smaller proportions from Rio de Janeiro (14.8%)
and Cear√° (6.5%), thereby limiting the generalizability of the findings.
Third, sampling bias cannot be excluded, as individuals experiencing higher
levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms may have been more
likely to participate (self-selection bias), potentially inflating prevalence estimates. Fourth,
all data were collected through a self-report online survey, which
is subject to recall bias and social desirability bias. Finally,
the study did not differentiate between physical activity performed during
leisure time and that performed in other domains. Future research
should investigate the role of different physical activity domains in
the associations between MVPA and symptoms of depression and anxiety
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
