Over the past 20 years (1997–2017), Garças Reservoir has experienced
various environmental changes, including management interventions such as macrophyte harvesting,
sewage diversion, and the construction of a secondary wastewater treatment
plant at the city zoo. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset, this
study aimed to (1) assess temporal changes in water quality
using a trophic state index (TSI) and (2) determine whether
the management measures implemented to date have resulted in improvements
in water quality. The TSI is widely used in monitoring
studies because it facilitates comparisons of ecosystem productivity and provides
an initial framework for assessing the degree of cultural eutrophication
(Carlson 1977; Salas & Martino 1991; Lamparelli 2004; Cunha et
al. 2013).
