Urban reservoirs are particularly susceptible to anthropogenic impacts because they
collect and retain materials and pollutants from their drainage basins,
as well as receive nutrient inputs that contribute to the
deterioration of water quality (Branco & Senna 1996; Figueredo &
Giani 2001; Dong et al. 2008; Fontana et al. 2014;
Zorzal-Almeida et al. 2017). Additionally, shallow systems are generally more
prone to eutrophication due to enhanced water-sediment interactions and feedback
mechanisms, which increase the system's resistance to restoration efforts (SÃ¸ndegaard
et al. 2003; Bicudo et al. 2007).
