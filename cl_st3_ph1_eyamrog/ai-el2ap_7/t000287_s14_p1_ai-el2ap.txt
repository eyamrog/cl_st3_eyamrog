Between 9 and 29 April 2020, all 60 healthcare workers
(HCWs) employed at CTO were tested for COVID-19. Each HCW
underwent IgM/IgG rapid testing using near-patient lateral flow devices. In
addition, nasopharyngeal swabs followed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
testing for SARS-CoV-2 were performed as a secondary diagnostic method
for those HCWs who exhibited symptoms such as fever, cough,
shortness of breath, or sore throat.
