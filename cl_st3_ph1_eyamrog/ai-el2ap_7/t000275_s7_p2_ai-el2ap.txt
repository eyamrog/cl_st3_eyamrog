There has been a rapid increase in the number of
studies addressing COVID-19 transmission, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, and potential therapies.
However, most of the recently published data lack sufficient scientific
rigor and high levels of evidence. The current situation presents
significant challenges to conducting studies that adhere to robust scientific
methodologies. Hospitals worldwide are facing supply shortages, including insufficient bed
capacity and inadequate numbers of healthcare professionals to provide patient
care. Additionally, there is a lack of essential equipment such
as mechanical ventilators and personal protective equipment (PPE), which are
critical for disease control and for preventing transmission among healthcare
workers. COVID-19 is primarily transmitted from person to person through
direct contact or via respiratory droplets generated by coughing or
sneezing from infected individuals.
