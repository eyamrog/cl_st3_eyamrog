This measure facilitates a gradual transmission of the disease among
individuals, thereby preventing a sharp peak in the incidence curve.
As a result, it enables the healthcare system to manage
cases more effectively by maintaining adequate availability of equipment and
personnel, and helps to avoid the overload experienced in other
countries where a high number of infections occurred within a
short period.
