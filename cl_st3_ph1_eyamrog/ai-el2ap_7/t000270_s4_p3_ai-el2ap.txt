A total of 986 samples were collected for the present
survey. Ninfeias Lake was the most frequently sampled site within
PEFI, with 327 samples collected. This was followed by Garças
Lake with 177 samples, the hydrophytoterium with 157 samples, and
IAG Lake with 152 samples. Ninfeias Lake also contained the
highest number of identified taxa, followed by Garças Lake. Although
the hydrophytoterium ranked third in the number of samples, it
is a highly managed system, and its current floristic composition
may no longer reflect its original state.
