The optimal duration for maintaining a patient on translaryngeal intubation
(TI) without increasing the risk of tracheal injury remains a
subject of debate. However, multiple studies have demonstrated the advantages
of performing an early tracheostomy (TQT), which, depending on varying
definitions, may be conducted within 2, 7, or 10 days
of initiating mechanical ventilation.
