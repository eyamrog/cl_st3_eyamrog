We will use Cochran’s Q test to evaluate the presence
of heterogeneity, considering a P value of less than 0.1
as indicative of heterogeneity. Additionally, we will assess statistical heterogeneity
using the Higgins I² statistic, applying the following thresholds: less
than 25% indicates no heterogeneity, 25% to 49% indicates low
heterogeneity, 50% to 74% indicates moderate heterogeneity, and 75% or
greater indicates high heterogeneity.
