The rapid identification of COVID-19 cases is essential for effective
pandemic containment. This process remains challenging due to the absence
of pathognomonic symptoms and the limited availability of specialized polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) testing, which itself has certain limitations. There
is a critical need to develop fast and accurate molecular
diagnostic methods to identify both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, thereby
reducing viral transmission and supporting appropriate public health measures. Rapid
diagnostic tests may also facilitate the resumption of elective healthcare
services by minimizing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Nevertheless, dental
professionals must continue to consider the potential transmission of other
infectious diseases through saliva and aerosols, including hepatitis B, measles,
and tuberculosis.
