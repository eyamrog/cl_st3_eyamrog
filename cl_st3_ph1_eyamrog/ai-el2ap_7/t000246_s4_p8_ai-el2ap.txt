This study has several methodological limitations, including reliance on a
single researcher and potential variability in the sensitivity of the
descriptors used to identify documents based on their titles. Additionally,
the exclusive nature of the findings may be attributable to
the use of only one database. Future research could address
these limitations by examining whether the observed patterns of co-author
productivity persist or change when a broader range of articles
is sampled from multiple databases. Despite these limitations, certain results
from this study appear to be noteworthy and merit further
investigation.
