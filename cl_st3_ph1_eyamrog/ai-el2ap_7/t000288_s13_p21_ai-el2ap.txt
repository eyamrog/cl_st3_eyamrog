In most countries, dental emergencies or urgent dental care for
patients without signs or symptoms of COVID-19 can be managed
in dental offices. However, due to the high prevalence of
asymptomatic COVID-19 cases, dental practitioners should implement enhanced precautions and
not assume that any patient is free of infection. In
addition to asymptomatic adults, children may pose a significant transmission
risk because they often exhibit milder symptoms compared to adults.
It is essential to maintain patient isolation by allowing only
one patient in the waiting area at a time and
to strictly adhere to infection control protocols, including the correct
donning and doffing of all personal protective equipment (PPE) such
as gowns, goggles, N95 masks with full face shields, and
gloves. Prior to each procedure, patients should rinse with either
1% or 1.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.2% povidone-iodine, and should
wear goggles and a bib throughout the procedure. To reduce
aerosol generation, dentists are advised to use hand instrumentation, high-volume
saliva ejectors, and dental dams, and to avoid the use
of the 3-in-1 syringe.
