Shaoqing et al.12 recently reported on a cohort of 34
patients who required hospitalization for severe COVID-19 symptoms that manifested
only after undergoing surgical procedures. In this study, asymptomatic individuals
with no clinical or epidemiological evidence of prior viral infection,
all residing in Wuhan, underwent surgery and subsequently developed postoperative
pneumonia. The authors concluded that surgical intervention may have accelerated
the onset and increased the severity of COVID-19 disease progression
in these patients.
