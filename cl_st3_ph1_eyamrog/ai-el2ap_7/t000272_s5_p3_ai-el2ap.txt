Other studies involving S. brasiliensis Engl. have demonstrated that increasing
solvent polarity leads to the separation of phytocompounds (Santos et
al., 2014). None of the fractions analyzed in the present
study contained tannins equivalent to catechin; however, the ethanolic extract
(EE) exhibited a tannin content of 15.83 mg/g. This result
may be attributed to the polarity of the solvents employed,
which may have limited the extraction of compounds with polarity
similar to that of catechin. Therefore, the absence of catechin-equivalent
tannins in the fractions does not necessarily indicate that the
bark of S. brasiliensis Engl. lacks tannins. Additionally, the flavonoid
content in each fraction was higher than that in the
EE, likely because the fractions are more concentrated, resulting in
higher measured values. In the study by Santos et al.
(2014), the presence of aurones, catechins, chalcones, flavanones, saponins, and
tannins was qualitatively detected in the ethyl acetate fraction, while
only steroids and triterpenes were identified in the hexane and
chloroform fractions, respectively. Unlike the present study, Santos et al.
(2014) did not quantify these compounds but rather reported their
presence or absence without the use of standard compounds, which
may account for the differing results observed in the ethyl
acetate fraction. Furthermore, when working with natural products, it is
important to consider factors that influence the production of secondary
metabolites in plants, such as the collection period, rainfall, seasonality,
and the presence of natural predators (Gouvea et al., 2012;
Li et al., 2014; Moore et al., 2014). These variables
may explain the differences observed, as the plant material in
the referenced studies was collected from different regions and at
different times compared to the present study.
