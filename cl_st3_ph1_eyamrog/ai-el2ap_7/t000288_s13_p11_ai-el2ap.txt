Remdesivir is an antiviral prodrug that is metabolized to remdesivir
triphosphate, which demonstrates in vitro activity against coronaviruses. Remdesivir triphosphate
functions as an inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and competes
with adenosine triphosphate for incorporation into nascent viral RNA chains.
Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine also exhibit in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2,
and their mechanisms of action include inhibition of viral enzymes
such as RNA polymerase, interference with viral protein glycosylation, disruption
of virus assembly, impairment of new virus particle transport, and
inhibition of virus release. Additional proposed mechanisms involve inhibition of
the ACE2 receptor, reduction of endosomal acidity, and immunomodulation through
the regulation of cytokine release.
