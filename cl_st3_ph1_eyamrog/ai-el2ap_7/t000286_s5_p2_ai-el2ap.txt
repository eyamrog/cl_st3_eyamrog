The equation indicates that government deficit and exchange rate have
a positive effect on foreign direct investment (FDI) in Turkey,
with coefficients of 0.000197 and 0.001518, respectively. This suggests that
a one-unit increase in government deficit or exchange rate is
associated with an increase in FDI by 0.000197 and 0.001518,
respectively. In contrast, inflation and interest rate exhibit a negative
relationship with FDI, as reflected by their coefficients of -0.007553
and -0.022135. This implies that a one-unit decrease in either
the interest rate or inflation rate is associated with a
decrease in FDI by 0.007553 and 0.022135, respectively.
