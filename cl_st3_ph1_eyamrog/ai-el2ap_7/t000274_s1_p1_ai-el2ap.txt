Healthcare professionals are currently confronted with a pandemic caused by
the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). The full clinical spectrum of
COVID-19 infection has not yet been completely characterized, and precise
data regarding its lethality, mortality, infectivity, and transmissibility remain unavailable.
At present, there is no specific vaccine or targeted pharmacological
treatment for COVID-19; management is primarily supportive and nonspecific. In
Brazil, as in other countries, the number of COVID-19 cases
has increased substantially, resulting in a corresponding rise in hospitalizations
and mortality. The states with the highest reported case numbers
are São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Distrito Federal, and Ceará.
The objective of this study is to provide guidance to
surgeons on the management of the airway in patients with
suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.
