Pacifiers, which are commonly used by children, are frequently exposed
to saliva and oral microorganisms, making them potential vehicles for
contamination and microbial transmission, including SARS-CoV-2. Proper hygiene of pacifiers
is therefore essential to reduce the risk of infection. Children
represent a particularly susceptible group for COVID-19 due to the
immaturity of their immune systems, and close contact within families
increases the risk of cross-infection. Given that SARS-CoV-2 can be
transmitted through aerosols and close contact, rigorous disinfection of pacifiers
is especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic.
