Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in pediatric patients is frequently characterized
by greater disease extent and severity compared to adults. Consequently,
SARS-CoV-2 infection presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms is a particular concern
in pediatric IBD (PIBD) populations. As of April 3, 2020,
data from the SECURE-IBD registry indicated that eleven children under
the age of 19 had been reported with SARS-CoV-2 infection
out of a total of 275 IBD patients, with no
cases originating from Brazil. Among these, only one patient was
younger than nine years; all cases were managed as outpatients,
and no fatalities were reported. These observations raise several important
questions: Are PIBD patients at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection?
Is the clinical course of infection in PIBD more severe
than in adults? Should IBD treatment be delayed or discontinued
during SARS-CoV-2 infection?
