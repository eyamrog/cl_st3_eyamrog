Immunization is a fundamental component of primary health care (PHC).
Increased vaccination coverage is associated with a reduction in hospitalizations
due to preventable diseases such as whooping cough, diphtheria, Haemophilus
influenzae, and measles. Currently, there are more than 36,000 vaccination
facilities in Brazil, offering 45 types of immunobiological products, including
vaccines, sera, and immunoglobulins. The Unified Health System (SUS) is
responsible for administering 95% of vaccine doses in the country.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Brazil advanced the start
of its influenza vaccination campaign by one month to mitigate
the impact of this seasonal respiratory disease, which can increase
hospitalization rates and place additional strain on the health system.
The campaign aims to immunize at least 90% of the
target population, comprising 67.6 million individuals.
