It is important to note that imaging findings are influenced
by the timing of imaging in relation to symptom onset
in infected patients (8,12,16). Previous studies have reported that more
than half of patients who undergo CT scans within two
days of symptom onset may have negative results (27). In
the present sample, 30 patients underwent CT imaging less than
two days after the onset of symptoms, and only two
of these cases yielded false-negative results.
