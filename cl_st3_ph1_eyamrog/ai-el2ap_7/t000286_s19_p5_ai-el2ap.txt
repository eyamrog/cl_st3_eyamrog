The results of the co-integration analysis presented in Table 3
indicate that the trace statistics exceed the critical values at
the 5% significance level for both equations, with values of
117.7144 > 69.81889 and 54.35455 > 47.85613, respectively. Additionally, the
p-values are less than 0.05 (0.0000 and 0.0109), further supporting
the rejection of the null hypothesis of no co-integration among
the variables. These findings provide evidence of a co-integrating relationship
among the variables used to model the impact of selected
macroeconomic factors on investment inflow in Turkey during the study
period. Therefore, the test results suggest the existence of a
long-run relationship in two co-integrating equations at the 5% significance
level.
