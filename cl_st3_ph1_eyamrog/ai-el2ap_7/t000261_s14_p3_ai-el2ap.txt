Data analysis was conducted using an adaptation of Carlsonâ€™s Trophic
State Index (TSI) (Carlson 1977), as modified by Lamparelli (2004)
for application in tropical reservoirs. This index was developed based
on data from reservoirs in the same region as the
present study (CETESB 2014). The TSI was calculated using measurements
of total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, and Secchi disk
depth (SD). This approach produced a 20-year time series of
trophic state data.
