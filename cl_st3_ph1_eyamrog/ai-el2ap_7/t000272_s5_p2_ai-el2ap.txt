The samples exhibited no cytotoxicity at the tested concentration, consistent
with the findings of Santos et al. (2014). According to
Bézivin et al. (2003), the selectivity index (SI) quantifies the
extent to which a test compound is more effective against
target cells compared to human cells. For a compound to
be considered a promising prototype for drug development, an SI
value of 10 or higher is generally required (Protopopova et
al., 2005). Reimão et al. (2010) reported that a higher
SI value indicates greater toxicity to microorganisms and reduced toxicity
to human cells. In this study, all tested samples demonstrated
SI values exceeding the threshold suggested in the literature, indicating
their potential as candidates for the development of natural products,
particularly due to their low cytotoxicity and satisfactory antimicrobial activity.
