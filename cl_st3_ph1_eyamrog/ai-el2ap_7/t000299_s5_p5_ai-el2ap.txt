Regular implementation of cleaning and disinfection procedures is a widely
used strategy to control the presence of pathogenic microorganisms. Although
only a limited number of studies were identified, this systematic
review found considerable variation in the disinfectant agents employed for
pacifier disinfection, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. Many of
the procedures described in the reviewed articles were adapted from
protocols originally developed for the general decontamination of products and
utensils intended for human use. Analysis of the included studies
identified nine distinct microbial control strategies, utilizing solutions and products
that operate through thermal, chemical, mechanical, and chemomechanical mechanisms.
