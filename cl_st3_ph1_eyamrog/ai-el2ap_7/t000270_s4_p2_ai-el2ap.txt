The survey of freshwater algae in the PEFI area is
nearly complete and encompasses over 50 years of non-systematic sampling
conducted in various PEFI water bodies. The collection includes samples
from nine reservoirs (Garças, Ninfeias, IAG, Cisnes, Bambus I, Bambus
II, Bugios, Monjolo, and Girinos), which are locally referred to
as “lakes,” as well as from the hydrophytoterium (an aquatic
plant exhibition area in the São Paulo Botanical Gardens) and
Pirarungáua Creek. All sites were visited on multiple occasions, with
some locations (Garças, Ninfeias, and IAG) sampled monthly during specific
ecological studies. Approximately 1,000 sample units were collected over the
57-year duration of this inventory. However, the survey of the
Radiococcaceae (Chlorophyceae) remains incomplete. Within the Bacillariophyta, the Coscinodiscophyceae have
been fully surveyed, and among the Bacillariophyceae, the Eunotiaceae, Pinnulariaceae,
Cymbellales, Surirellales, and Rhopalodiales have been completed. As a result,
all other diatom groups have not yet been surveyed.
