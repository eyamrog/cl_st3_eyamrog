The recent COVID-19 pandemic has developed into a global public
health crisis. The virus is transmitted through contact with contaminated
surfaces and exposure to bodily fluids from infected individuals, including
saliva and aerosols. A significant proportion of infected individuals remain
asymptomatic and can contribute to the spread of the virus.
These factors place dental offices at a particularly high risk
for cross-infection between patients and dental healthcare providers. At present,
there is no effective treatment for COVID-19, and rapid diagnosis
remains challenging. Consequently, all elective dental treatments and non-essential procedures
should be postponed, with only urgent and emergency cases being
managed in dental clinics. Such unexpected situations can result in
financial difficulties for dental professionals, highlighting the importance of incorporating
financial education into dental curricula. Additionally, the use of telecommunication
methods, such as phone calls, text messages, and teledentistry, represents
a promising approach to maintaining patient contact while minimizing the
risk of infection.
