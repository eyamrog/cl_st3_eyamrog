It is essential to assess the impact of testing healthcare
workers (HCWs) within any given service. In this instance, the
identification of three asymptomatic and one symptomatic HCW enabled the
service to implement appropriate isolation measures for individuals who could
pose a risk to themselves and to patients, particularly considering
that the majority of patients attending the CTO are immunosuppressed
to some extent.
