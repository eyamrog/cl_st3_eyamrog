It is essential for dentists, as health professionals, to be
informed about the biological and social factors associated with the
COVID-19 pandemic in order to effectively educate the public and
implement optimal clinical protocols that minimize the risk of perioperative
transmission. Based on the current evidence regarding oral health care,
the objective of this critical appraisal is to summarize prevention
strategies for dental professionals and provide an overview of the
virusâ€™s history, pathogenesis, ongoing pharmacological clinical trials, and approaches to
mitigate the economic and health impacts on the oral health
