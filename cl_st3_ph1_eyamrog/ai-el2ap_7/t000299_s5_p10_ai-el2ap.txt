Daily washing of pacifiers with running water and a neutral
detergent, combined with vigorous mechanical action for a minimum of
five minutes, has been recommended as an effective cleaning method
[8]. Previous studies have reported positive outcomes when this protocol
was followed [25]. Alternatively, immersion of the pacifier in a
2.5% sodium hypochlorite solution for five minutes has been shown
to achieve complete disinfection [8], a result that has also
been observed with toothbrushes [26].
