In summary, a string or interval lc is defined to
account for the new sequences generated at step 𝑙𝑐−1 when
a shift is applied one nucleotide at a time. Each
ordered pair formed during this process belongs to the set
𝐵 × 𝐵, where 𝐵 = {𝐴, 𝐺, 𝑇, 𝐶}.
This procedure is performed for both the original sequence and
its reverse, ensuring that both orientations are considered in the
analysis.
