Despite the Ministry of Healthâ€™s consistent emphasis on the importance
of adopting preventive measures, initial compliance among the population primarily
reflected a process of adaptation, particularly with respect to restrictions
such as social distancing. This adaptation was partially undermined by
concerns over rising unemployment, reduced income, and, in some cases,
the tendency to underestimate the potential risks associated with the
pandemic. Such behaviors may reduce the effectiveness of public health
measures and increase the likelihood of a resurgence in cases,
as illustrated in Figure 2. Health and political authorities at
the state level have undertaken efforts to encourage the population
to remain at home in order to flatten the epidemic
curve and reduce viral transmission, and have also periodically reviewed
and updated their recommendations.
