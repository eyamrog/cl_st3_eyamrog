Materials: Prior to initiating the procedure, ensure the availability of
two standard plastic suction or irrigation tubes, a water seal
device, and a sterile transparent plastic bag intended for laparoscopic
optic coverage. Confirm that the nurse assistant prepares a 2%
or 2.5% hypochlorous acid (HClO) solution by diluting 25 mL
of hypochlorous acid in 975 mL of water to obtain
a total volume of 1000 mL, as this concentration has
recently been reported to inactivate the virus. Alternatively, a stabilized
chlorine dioxide solution at 7% can be used by diluting
5 mL of the product in 1000 mL of water.
These solutions are intended to fill the water seal reservoir,
allowing the distal end of the plastic cannula to be
submerged (Figure 1). After filling, securely close the reservoir with
the designated cover and connect the first suction tube to
the water seal at orifice A, as illustrated in Figure
2A.
