In Turkey, various macroeconomic policies and reforms have been implemented
by the government with the aim of attracting foreign direct
investment (FDI); however, these efforts have not yielded the desired
results, as evidenced by the persistently low and volatile levels
of FDI inflows. This issue has raised concerns among stakeholders.
Consequently, this study investigates the impact of selected macroeconomic policy
variables on FDI inflows in Turkey. Data for the analysis
were obtained from the Central Bank of Turkey statistical bulletin
for the period 1994â€“2018. The variables examined include exchange rates,
inflation rates, interest rates, and government deficit. The findings indicate
that all the explanatory variables collectively influence FDI inflows. Specifically,
government deficit and exchange rates exhibit a significant positive effect
on FDI in Turkey. Based on these results, it is
recommended that the government formulate and implement effective policies that
enhance the attractiveness of FDI by focusing on the identified
macroeconomic variables. These variables have been demonstrated to be important
instruments for promoting FDI inflows. The study further recommends the
creation of a conducive environment to support the growth of
FDI in Turkey.
