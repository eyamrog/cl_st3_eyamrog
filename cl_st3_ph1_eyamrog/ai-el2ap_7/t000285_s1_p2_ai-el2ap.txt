Design and setting: This protocol outlines a rapid living systematic
review that will adhere to the recommendations of the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews. The review will include prospective and
retrospective cohort studies, case-control studies, and case series involving patients
with confirmed diagnoses of both SARS-CoV-2 and arboviral infections. The
literature search will be conducted without language restrictions across multiple
databases, including Medline via PubMed, Embase via Elsevier, the Cochrane
Library (CENTRAL), Portal Regional BVS (LILACS), Scopus, and Web of
Science, to identify published, ongoing, and unpublished studies. Study selection
and data extraction will be independently performed by two authors.
The methodological quality of included studies will be assessed using
the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and the certainty of evidence will be
evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation
(GRADE) approach.
