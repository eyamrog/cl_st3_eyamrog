The EE underwent liquid-liquid partitioning. It was first dissolved in
an ethanol:water mixture (80:20, v/v) at a 1:1 (v/v) ratio.
The resulting EE solution was transferred to a separatory funnel,
and the solvents hexane (Hex), chloroform (Chlo), and ethyl acetate
(EtAc) (all from Merck, Darmstadt, Hessen, Germany) were sequentially added
at a 1:1 (v/v) ratio, followed by stirring. The mixture
was allowed to stand for approximately 10 minutes to facilitate
phase separation. This extraction process was repeated three times for
each solvent to obtain sufficient quantities of each fraction. Each
resulting fraction was then concentrated using a vacuum rotary evaporator
at 40 Â°C and 55 rpm until complete removal of
the solvent was achieved.
