Regarding mortality, groups 1 and 5.1 exhibit the highest rates,
with 11.586 and 9.925 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively. In
contrast, group 4 demonstrates the lowest mortality rate at 0.209
deaths per 100,000 inhabitants; this result may be influenced by
the inclusion of China, given its large population size. However,
group 3, which comprises countries with an expanded vaccine scheme,
has the lowest case fatality rate, with 1.87 deaths per
100 cases (p < 0.001).
