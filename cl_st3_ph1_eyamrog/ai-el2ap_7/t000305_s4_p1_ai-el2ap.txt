The lower incidence of COVID-19 cases and deaths in countries
with established vaccination programs is both noteworthy and biologically plausible.
Current data from the ongoing pandemic indicate a correlation between
vaccination coverage and reduced numbers of cases and deaths in
the countries analyzed. Continued data collection and analysis will be
essential to further substantiate or challenge this association. Rapid implementation
of controlled studies utilizing straightforward methodologies is recommended, and until
a specific vaccine for COVID-19 is developed, existing vaccination programs
may represent the most effective available intervention.
