Human activities and climate variability have significantly affected ecosystem functioning
(Holmgren et al. 2001; O’Brien et al. 2012; Seneviratne 2012),
leading to alterations in natural regeneration processes and introducing novel
dynamics within plant communities (Hubbell & Foster 1992). These influences
may result in shorter forest cycles, increased community dynamism (Körner
2004; Laurance et al. 2009), and shifts in species distributions
(Hubbell 2004; Colombo & Joly 2010; Machado & Oliveira-Filho 2010;
Feeley et al. 2011). Further research on the functioning of
plant communities is necessary, particularly in light of the increasing
frequency of environmental changes (Lavell et al. 2012), the rapid
pace at which these changes are occurring (Feeley et al.
2011), and their potential impacts on remaining ecosystems.
