Two authors (ACPNP and APR) will independently extract data using
a predefined extraction form. Any discrepancies or disagreements will be
resolved by a third author (CRRF). The extraction form will
include information on patient demographic and clinical characteristics, details of
the pharmacological treatment (drug name, treatment duration, and dose), time
points for assessments, the number of patients lost to follow-up
in each group, reasons for loss to follow-up, methods for
handling missing data (including whether data imputation was performed and
the use of an intention-to-treat approach), sources of funding, potential
conflicts of interest, adverse events, outcome measures, and protocol deviations.
To evaluate the feasibility of conducting a meta-analysis, we will
also extract, for each primary and secondary outcome measure, the
total number of patients in each group, the number of
events in each group for dichotomous outcomes, and for continuous
outcomes, the mean, standard deviation, standard error, median, interquartile range,
minimum, maximum, 95% confidence interval, and p-value.
