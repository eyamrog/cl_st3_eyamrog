Each sample was analyzed for gallic acid content using High
Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) according to the method described by
Schieber et al. (2001). The analyses were performed on a
Shimadzu HPLC system (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a
diode array detector (model SPD-M10A) and a C-18 column (Phenomenex
Gemini, 4.6 mm × 250 mm, 3 µm particle size).
The mobile phase consisted of 1% formic acid and methanol
in a 90:10 (v/v) ratio, delivered at a flow rate
of 1.0 mL/min. The column temperature was maintained at 30
°C, and detection was carried out at a wavelength of
272 nm. The injection volume for each sample was 10
µL.
