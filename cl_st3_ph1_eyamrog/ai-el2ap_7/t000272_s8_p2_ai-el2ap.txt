Dental caries is a highly prevalent global disease (Bagramian et
al. 2009). It is a multifactorial and chronic infectious condition
caused by tooth-adherent bacteria, primarily Streptococcus species, which metabolize dietary
sugars to produce acid, leading to the demineralization of tooth
structure over time (Abranches et al. 2018). Streptococcus mitis, S.
oralis, and S. salivarius are involved in the initial adhesion
of bacteria to the tooth surface and can facilitate the
colonization of other oral microbiota, including additional streptococci and periodontopathogens
(Butler et al. 2017). Additionally, S. salivarius has been implicated
in cases of meningitis (Falomir et al. 2014; Suy et
al. 2013; Vignier et al. 2014), while S. oralis and
S. mitis have been shown to enhance the virulence of
Candida albicans (Palma et al. 2019) and are associated with
bloodstream infections in pediatric patients (Basaranoglu et al. 2019). Streptococcus
mutans is the microorganism most frequently associated with the development
of dental caries, as it initiates tooth demineralization by acidifying
the microenvironment and tooth surface (Abranches et al. 2018; Baker
et al. 2016). Furthermore, S. mutans is linked to bacteremia
and endocarditis (Nakano et al. 2005; Nakano et al. 2009).
Therefore, research into effective strategies to minimize these infections is
warranted.
