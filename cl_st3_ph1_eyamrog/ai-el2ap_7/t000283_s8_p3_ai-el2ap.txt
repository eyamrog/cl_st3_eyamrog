Although the mortality rate is a significant concern, the high
transmissibility of the disease presents a greater challenge. Even with
a relatively low proportion of patients requiring hospitalization, the rapid
spread and large number of infections have placed substantial strain
on healthcare systems globally. In response, stringent social distancing measures—including
travel restrictions and the closure of schools and businesses—have resulted
in considerable socioeconomic and psychological consequences. Consequently, COVID-19 has had
a profound impact on quality of life and has posed
substantial risks to the economy, public health, and the sustainability
of healthcare systems (4).
