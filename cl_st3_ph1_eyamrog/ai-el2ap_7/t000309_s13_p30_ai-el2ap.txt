A recent publication by the Pediatric IBD PORTO Group of
ESPGHAN summarized essential data regarding children with inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD) who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and offered specific recommendations
for clinical management. During the pandemic, pediatric gastroenterology specialists from
China and Korea reported 272 cases of children with IBD
and SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas European sources documented eight pediatric IBD
patients aged 14 to 19 years with COVID-19, as recorded
in the PORTO-IBD group and the SECURE-IBD database.
