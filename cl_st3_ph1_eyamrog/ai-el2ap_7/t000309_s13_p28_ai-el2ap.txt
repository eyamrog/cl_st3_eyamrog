Patients with anorectal septic complications (such as perianal abscess secondary
to Crohnâ€™s disease), acute peritonitis, bowel obstruction, severe or toxic
colitis (including toxic megacolon), and gastrointestinal hemorrhage that do not
respond to conservative management are considered potential candidates for surgical
intervention during the pandemic; however, each case should be evaluated
individually. Additionally, patients with advanced colorectal malignancy at risk of
progression to unresectable disease may also be considered for surgery.
When feasible, minimally invasive approaches, such as percutaneous abscess drainage,
should be prioritized.
