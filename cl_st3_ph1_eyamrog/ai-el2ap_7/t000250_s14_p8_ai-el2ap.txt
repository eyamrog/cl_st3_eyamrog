Time spent in sedentary behavior (SB) was assessed using the
question: “Since self-isolating, how much time have you spent sitting
daily?” For analysis, SB was categorized as a dichotomous variable,
with responses classified as either less than 10 hours per
day (coded as 1) or 10 hours or more per
day (coded as 2), consistent with the approach adopted in
previous studies.23,24
