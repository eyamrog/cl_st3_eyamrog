Assessing the prevalence trends of viral infections among blood donors
is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of blood safety strategies
and for informing improvements to enhance transfusion safety, including minimizing
the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through blood transfusion [15].
Additionally, determining the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors can
serve as a means of monitoring viral circulation within the
healthy population, thereby supporting the development of strategies to reduce
transmission risk, particularly in settings where seroprevalence surveys are unavailable.
However, there is a limited number of studies investigating SARS-CoV-2
prevalence among blood donors. Two unpublished studies have reported seroprevalence
rates of 1.7% in Denmark and 2.7% in the Netherlands,
respectively [16, 17].
