Dental caries and periodontal disease are among the most prevalent
biofilm-associated diseases. Due to the numerous side effects associated with
chlorhexidine, there is an increasing demand for new, safe therapeutic
alternatives targeting the microorganisms involved in these conditions. This study
evaluated the antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of extracts derived from
the bark of Schinopsis brasiliensis Engl. against five oral microorganisms,
and analyzed their phytochemical composition and thermal degradation profiles. Liquid-liquid
partitioning was conducted using hexane, chloroform, and ethyl acetate. Chemical
marker identification and quantification were performed, and antimicrobial activity was
assessed by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration. Cytotoxicity was evaluated
based on the hemolytic potential of the samples. Thermal degradation
profiles were obtained using two different analytical methods. Gallic acid
was identified as the principal compound, with the highest concentration
found in the chloroform fraction. All samples inhibited the growth
of the tested microorganisms and exhibited no cytotoxicity. The ethanol
extract demonstrated lower heat absorption compared to the fractions. All
samples displayed an exothermic peak consistent with gallic acid degradation.
These findings indicate that the tested samples are potential candidates
for incorporation into dental formulations aimed at biofilm control.
