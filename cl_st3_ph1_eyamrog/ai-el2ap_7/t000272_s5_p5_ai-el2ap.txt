The thermogravimetric (TG) curve of the ethyl acetate fraction exhibits
three distinct stages of thermal decomposition. The first stage occurs
between 29.35 and 225.23 째C, similar to the pattern observed
in the ethanol extract (EE). In addition to the loss
of moisture and residual solvent, this stage likely involves the
volatilization of another compound, as the total mass loss was
16.97% (1.13 mg). The second stage, observed between 225.30 and
327.87 째C, is attributed to the degradation of flavonoids and
gallic acid present in the sample, resulting in a mass
loss of 26.42% (1.76 mg); this is consistent with the
known exothermic degradation peak of gallic acid at approximately 263
째C. The final stage begins at 328.00 째C and is
associated with the decomposition of carbonaceous residues, leading to an
additional mass loss of 46.23%, although complete degradation is not
achieved.
