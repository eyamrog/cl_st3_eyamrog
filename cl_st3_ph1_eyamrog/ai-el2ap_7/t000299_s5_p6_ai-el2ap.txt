Although numerous studies have described various decontamination protocols and agents,
only a limited range of microorganisms has been tested. The
fungi and bacteria analyzed were consistently from the same genera,
specifically Candida and Streptococcus, both of which are commonly present
in the oral microbiota. Furthermore, even when there was consensus
regarding the microorganisms selected, the microbiological analysis strategies differed: three
studies employed Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) [3,10,15], while four studies
utilized the viable count method [8,9,11,13]. SEM is an appropriate
technique for detailed observation of substrate morphology as well as
for monitoring bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation on biotic surfaces
[21]. The viable count method, which has been used for
decades, is a sensitive approach for analyzing live microorganisms [22].
