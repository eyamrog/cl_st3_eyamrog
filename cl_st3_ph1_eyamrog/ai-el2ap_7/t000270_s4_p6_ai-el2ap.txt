The high numbers of species, varieties, and taxonomic forms identified
in this study can be primarily attributed to the extensive
sampling effort, which spanned more than 50 years of intensive
collection. The prolonged duration of sampling likely contributed to the
identification of a greater number of taxa. In addition to
the length of the sampling period, the investigation encompassed multiple
aquatic compartments within PEFI, including plankton, periphyton, and surface sediments
of semilentic systems such as reservoirs, which further enhanced the
observed taxonomic richness. Notably, the periphyton and surface sediment compartments
together accounted for nearly 40% of the total taxa recorded
in the present flora. These factors collectively resulted in the
most comprehensive inventory of freshwater algal flora conducted in Brazil
to date.
