The study of the algal flora in the Parque Estadual
das Fontes do Ipiranga (PEFI) began in 1962 with the
documentation of 17 desmid species collected from the hydrophytoterium of
the São Paulo Botanical Gardens. However, systematic investigations commenced only
in 1990 with the establishment of the “Parque Estadual das
Fontes do Ipiranga Cryptogamic Flora” project. The research has primarily
utilized material collected from plankton, periphyton, and surface sediments of
PEFI water bodies, as well as samples from tree bark,
rocks, and soil. To date, forty-two fascicles of the algal
flora have been published, documenting 869 taxa, including species, varieties,
and taxonomic forms. It is estimated that approximately 95% of
the local algal flora has been surveyed, and the completion
of the inventory is projected for the end of 2020.
