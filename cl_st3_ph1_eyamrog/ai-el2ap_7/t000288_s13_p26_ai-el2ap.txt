In private offices, the restriction of dental and medical activities
to only urgent and emergency procedures has had a significant
economic impact on these sectors. This economic crisis has prompted
considerations that extend beyond clinical safety and social distancing, emphasizing
the importance of social security and financial education. These factors
should be addressed by organizations that regulate dental practice to
facilitate discussions and provide support for dentists during periods when
they are required to suspend routine clinical activities, such as
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
