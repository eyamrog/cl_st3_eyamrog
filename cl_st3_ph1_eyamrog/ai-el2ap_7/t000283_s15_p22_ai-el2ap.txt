We will conduct a critical appraisal of the included studies
using the Risk of Bias tool (10), as recommended by
the Cochrane Collaboration. The certainty of evidence will be evaluated
using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)
approach (11). GRADE assessments will consider the overall risk of
bias, consistency of results, directness of evidence, publication bias, and
precision of results for each outcome. The GRADE profiler software,
which is available online, will be used to summarize the
findings regarding the certainty of evidence (12). Two review authors
will independently assess the risk of bias (ACPNP and KMMM)
and the certainty of evidence (VTC and NCJ). Any disagreements
in these assessments will be resolved through discussion or, if
necessary, by consulting a third author (ANA).
