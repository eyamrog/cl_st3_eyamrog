This study examines the relationship between Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
inflows and key economic indicators in Turkey, specifically the Real
Effective Exchange Rate (REER) and Gross Domestic Product per capita
based on Purchasing Power Parity (GDP PPP). The inclusion of
the GDP (PPP) variable is justified by its demonstrated causal
impact on the REER, as well as its association with
the volatility of the U.S. Dollar exchange rate in the
Turkish stock market.
