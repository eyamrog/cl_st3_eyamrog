The maximum height recorded in the community was 18 m,
observed in a specimen of Aspidosperma olivaceum MÃ¼ll.Arg (Apocynaceae). The
median diameter at breast height (dbh) for the shrub-tree synusia
was 5 cm, with the largest dbh measured at 43.3
cm in a specimen of Tapirira guianensis Aubl. (Anacardiaceae). For
climbers, the median dbh was 4.6 cm, and the maximum
recorded value was 22.3 cm. The distribution of dbh values
for live plants in 2012 did not differ significantly from
that in 2006 (Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, n1 = 367, n2 =
385, D = 0.05, p = 0.81; see Figure 2a).
The mean relative diameter growth rate for plants in the
shrub-tree synusia was 1.14% per year (median = 0.58% per
year), with a minimum growth rate of zero and a
maximum of 9.05% per year, the latter observed in a
specimen of Cryptocarya mandioccana Meisn. (Lauraceae). The diameter growth rates
of plants with 2.5 < dbh < 5 cm (median
= 0.48% per year) did not differ significantly from those
of plants with dbh > 5 cm (median = 0.7%
per year; Mann-Whitney Test, n1 = 185, n2 = 166,
z = 1.549, p = 0.12; see Figure 2b).
