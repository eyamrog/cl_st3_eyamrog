The removal of macrophytes in 1999 resulted in a significant
increase in mean Trophic State Index (TSI) values, which corresponded
with a shift to a more turbid state, elevated phosphorus
concentrations, and the activation of feedback mechanisms (Bicudo et al.
2007). This led to a continued rise in TSI values
until late 2001 and early 2002, as determined by point
break regression analysis (Figure 5). In the years following this
abrupt change, TSI values began to decline, a trend that
can be associated with specific management interventions documented in the
system's history (Tables 1 and 3). Notably, the implementation of
secondary wastewater treatment at the city zoo in October 2007
appears to have played a significant role. Additionally, there is
evidence of a reduction in internal phosphorus loading since 2005,
as indicated by lower surface phosphorus concentrations in the time
series (Figure 3) and a decrease in bottom soluble reactive
phosphorus concurrent with increased bottom oxygen levels (DCB, unpublished data).
Consequently, after 2007, the combined effects of these processes contributed
to the initial improvement in water quality. Furthermore, from 2008
onwards, a marked limnological shift was observed, characterized by a
change in cyanobacterial dominance from Microcystis aeruginosa (Kützing) Kützing to
Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (Woloszýnska) Seenayya & Subba Raju (Crossetti et al.
2019).
