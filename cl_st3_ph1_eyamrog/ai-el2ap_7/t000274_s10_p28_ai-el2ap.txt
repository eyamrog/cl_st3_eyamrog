Wear disposable gowns that are resistant to liquids and fluids
(waterproof). If a permeable gown is used, a disposable plastic
gown should be worn underneath. The gown must be sterilized,
have long sleeves with mesh or elastic cuffs, and feature
a rear opening. Additionally, it should be constructed from high-quality,
non-allergenic, and durable materials. The gown must provide an effective
antimicrobial barrier, facilitate the performance of tasks comfortably, and be
available in various sizes.
