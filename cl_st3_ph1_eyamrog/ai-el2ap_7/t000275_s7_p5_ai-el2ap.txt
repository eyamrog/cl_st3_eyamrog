There is evidence that laparoscopic procedures can generate aerosols containing
viral particles. However, it remains unclear whether conventional open surgical
procedures are safer than laparoscopic approaches in the context of
COVID-19. Devices such as the AirSeal iFS® System and the
Laparoshield™ Laparoscopic Smoke Filtration System have been developed and approved
for use in filtering surgical smoke, with the aim of
removing particles, cells, and viruses. Nevertheless, there are currently no
studies demonstrating their effectiveness specifically against SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the availability
of these devices during the pandemic, particularly in low-income countries,
is limited.
