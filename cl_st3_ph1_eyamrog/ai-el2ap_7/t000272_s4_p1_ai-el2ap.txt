Given the satisfactory antimicrobial activity observed against bacteria associated with
the initial colonization of the tooth surface and the early
stages of dental caries, as well as the low cytotoxicity
and high selectivity demonstrated, all samples of the ethanolic extract
(EE) from the bark of Schinopsis brasiliensis Engl. may be
considered potential candidates for inclusion in dental formulations aimed at
controlling oral biofilm.
