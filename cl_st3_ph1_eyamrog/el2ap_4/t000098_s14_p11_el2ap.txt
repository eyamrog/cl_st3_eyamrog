A last relevant general methodological information is that the numbers
of deaths that served to calculate mortality rates by age
group (mij) were not those directly obtained from the reported
sources. When disaggregated by age groups, the reference dates for
this information vary greatly and are not homogeneous even in
the case of the most developed countries surveyed. As can
be seen in Chart 1, despite the great effort made,
in some countries, the most recent data obtained refers to
dates as far as 9/11/2020 (Ecuador), 10/25/2020 (Turkey) or 11/6/2020
(Poland). Whatever the time lag, international benchmarking requires that the
numbers of deaths by age group correspond to a single
date. The procedure for this temporal standardization was very simple
and involved solely the distribution of the accumulated contingent of
deaths in each country until 1/28/2021, according to the pattern
identified up to the most recent date the disaggregation by
age group was available. In other words, this age pattern
of mortality was extrapolated to that date6.
