The present study provides insight into the characteristics of study
protocols with randomized clinical trials by showing which protocols might
be more suitable for a given study, as well as
which instruments are most used for obtaining physical and psychological
outcomes. The survey carried out and shown in this scoping
review will help further research that involves physical activity and/or
physical exercise for women with breast cancer.
