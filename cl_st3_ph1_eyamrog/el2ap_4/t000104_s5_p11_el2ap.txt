The collection of organisms in mesohabitats proved to be adequate
considering that these zones favor the establishment and presence of
benthic macroinvertebrates, providing, for example, food source, breeding place and
physical substrate. But variation of these factors may influence the
distribution of organisms throughout the different locations of mesohabitats (GORNI;
ALVES:, 2012). In addition, these organisms are good spatial representatives
of habitat disturbances, considering their low mobility in the environment
(BEGHELLI et al., 2012).
