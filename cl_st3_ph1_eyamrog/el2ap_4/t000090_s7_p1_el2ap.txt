Academic evaluation is a problem that has been considered for
a long time in education. In Brazil, evaluations have been
made for a long time in higher education (GUIMARÃES and
ESTEVES, 2018). Regarding graduate programmes, the “Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamente de
Pessoal de Nível Superior” (CAPES) evaluates these Programmes for several
decades now (RODRIGUES et al., 2020). At this moment, there
is a strong modification in the criterions under study, using
concepts of the multidimensional approach.
