Garrison et al. (1999) claim that appropriate cognitive presence and
social presence are dependent upon the presence of a teacher
whose role includes defining and initiating discussion topics, building understanding,
among other things. Based on peer-facilitation techniques, a study by
Chen, Lei, and Cheng (2019) revealed that teacher presence may
affect the level of cognitive presence in online classes. The
intervention of peer facilitators during the course, especially when asking
questions of a specific type, affected the level of cognitive
presence. For Braga (2007), the facilitation of discussions can also
have a distributed character in online educational experiences as course
participants may facilitate discussions that involve, for example, encouraging discussions,
identifying points of convergence and divergence, and proposing new ideas,
a role generally played by a teacher.
