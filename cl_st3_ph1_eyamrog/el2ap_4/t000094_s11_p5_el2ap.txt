Picturebooks are a clear example of multimodal texts that combine
written texts and visuals to create meaning. Different authors have
studied the combination of different semiotic modes to express meanings
in multimodal discourse (Kress & van Leeuwen, 2006; Molina &
Alonso, 2016; Oâ€™Halloran 2004, 2008; Unsworth, 2006, 2014; Painter et
al., 2013, among others).
