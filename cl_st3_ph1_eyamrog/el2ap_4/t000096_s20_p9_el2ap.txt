This Master's Program in ICT-mediated Learning Management proposal stems from
a study of relevance and demand developed by the UMAYUK
research group of UNACH. First, it was possible to evidence
the limited offer in Ecuador of master's programs aimed at
developing the digital skills of teachers, even less in the
online mode, despite the fact that the scientific literature mentions
high possibilities of guaranteeing formal learning (Martín, Mora, Añorbe &
González 2017; Quiroz 2017).
