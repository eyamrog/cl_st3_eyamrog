Leaf formation was first detected in seeds at 14 days
of culture, concomitantly to roots (figures 1d and 2). The
same occurred for leaves of NS, although roots were detected
at 28 days (figure 2). Accordingly, it was reported that
Acanthostachys strobilacea (Schult. & Schult.f.) Klotzsch seedlings develop roots earlier
than leaves (Pereira 1988) while in node cultures, shoots are
generally formed prior to roots, requiring hormonal addition to the
media to induce rooting (George et al. 2008) â€’ although
this is not the case for A. strobilacea (Santos et
al. 2010, 2017).
