The physical outcomes most found in the study protocols comprised
the physical conditions and limitations of women with breast cancer,
such as decreased function of the upper limb71, decreased range
of motion and muscle strength19, and cardiovascular consequences72. In almost
all studies, the limiting factors related to the disease were
investigated, given that there is a concern with the return
of these women to daily activities. Thus, the Disabilities of
the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) test, the Sitting- rising
test in 30 seconds (30s - SRT) and the 6-minute
walk test (6MWT) were the instruments most often used by
the studies assessed. These instruments have a low cost and
are fast to be applied.
