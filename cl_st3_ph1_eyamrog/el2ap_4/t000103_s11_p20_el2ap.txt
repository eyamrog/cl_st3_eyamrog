Inspired by Valenzuela et al. (2011), the resolution of zero
and pronominal forward and backwards anaphora in Spanish and Portuguese
will be compared to non-emphatic and emphatic pronominal forward and
backwards anaphora in English. After our pilot-studies (Bruscato & Baptista,
2022a, 2022b), we have expanded our research to investigate how
L1 and L2 speakers solve ambiguity in these languages.
