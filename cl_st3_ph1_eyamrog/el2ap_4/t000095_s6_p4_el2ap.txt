São Paulo has more hospital beds per inhabitant compared to
Rio and greater primary health care coverage in 2020 (62.9%
and 58.9%, respectively)5, but these differences are not that great
to explain the discrepancy in hospitalized patients with Covid. Greater
disorganization of the health system in Rio de Janeiro compared
to São Paulo is an ongoing process. In July 2019,
the Regional Labor Court of the 1st Region in Rio
de Janeiro determined the seizure of R$ 38 million of
accounts to the municipality of Rio de Janeiro to pay
compensation to 1,500 health agents dismissed by the Institute of
Basic and Advanced Health Care (Iabas, acronym in Portuguese, Instituto
de Atenção Básica e Avançada à Saúde)6. This same institution
was involved in the disastrous administration of the field hospitals
during the pandemic and, as is well known, corruption in
the health department of Rio de Janeiro culminated in the
arrest of the state health secretary.
