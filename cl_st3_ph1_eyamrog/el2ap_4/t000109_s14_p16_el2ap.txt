For each Ha, there is a method that measures whether
there is another agent within a 2-m range [39][40][41]. If
this proximity lasts for 15 minutes or longer and either
agent is infected (symptomatic or asymptomatic), then the epidemiological state
attribute of the not infected Ha changes to exposed (E),
with probability 𝑣(𝑇𝑒𝑚𝑝) ∗𝛽.
