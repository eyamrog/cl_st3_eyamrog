The present paper made a study of the academic international
multidimensional ranking “U-Multirank”, which is a ranking that has five
Dimensions and 36 Indicators. This ranking was studied by Capes
during the preparation of the new evaluation of the Post-
Graduate programmes in Brazil (CAPES, 2019). This fact justifies further
studies of this ranking using data already available; to have
an idea of what type of results it may give
when applied in Brazil.
