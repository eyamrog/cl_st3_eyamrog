Since it is an ABM, the core of the model
is constituted by agents named human (Ha). Each Ha has
the ability to acquire and transmit SARS-CoV-2 virus; to change
the symptoms and health state, according to the infection spread,
and to change behaviors accordingly (Infectivity submodel, Section 3.1). Besides,
each Ha has specific characteristics and attributes corresponding to specific
risk factors and comorbidities (Epidemiological characterization submodel, Section 3.2).
