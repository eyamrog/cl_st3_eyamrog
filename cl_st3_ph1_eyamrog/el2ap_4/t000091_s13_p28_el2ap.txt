Movafegh et al. (2008) conducted a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled
clinical trial with 60 patients randomly assigned to receive either
Passiflora incarnata (500 mg) or placebo as a premedication 90
minutes before the surgery. Anxiety, sedation, and psychomotor function were
evaluated. They concluded that the oral administration of Passiflora incarnata
as a pre-anesthetic medication reduces anxiety without inducing sedation.
