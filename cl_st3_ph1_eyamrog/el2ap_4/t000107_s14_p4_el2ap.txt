To further verify the reliability of the portal, we carried
out a search on Google.com by simultaneously entering the terms
dissertação, mestrado, and tradução médica (thesis, master’s, medical translation, respectively).
Such search returned approximately 1,910,000 hits for master's thesis and
1,080,000 for doctorate dissertations. Some of the hits that met
our selection criteria and were not found in our initial
search, at www.dominiopublico.gov.br, were listed and searched for again, at
the Domínio Público website. More specifically, we only searched again
for the hits included in the first two pages of
the Google search engine, because to search once more for
all the hits that met our criteria – and were
left out of our initial search in the Domínio Público
website – would be too time-consuming. Such process identified master
theses and doctorate dissertations, which were completed in the time
period set for our study, that were not catalogued at
the Domínio Público website. This mismatch motivated an expansion of
the methodology proposed by Alves and Vasconcellos (2016), which was
entering keywords at www.dominiopublico.gov.br only.
