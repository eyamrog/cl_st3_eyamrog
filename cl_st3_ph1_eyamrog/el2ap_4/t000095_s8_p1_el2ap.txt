At the end of June 2021, more than 504,000 deaths
of COVID-19 have been reported in Brazil and the number
is increasing at a fast rate. At this point, the
state of Rio de Janeiro has the second-highest COVID-19 mortality
rate (329 per 100,000 inhabitants) in Brazil1. Rio de Janeiro
is the second-largest economy in the country, second only to
SÃ£o Paulo, which makes the high mortality rates observed in
the state, in comparison to other states, inexplicable.
