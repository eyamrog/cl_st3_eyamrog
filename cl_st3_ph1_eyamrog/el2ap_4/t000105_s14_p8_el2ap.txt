A three-stage conglomerate sampling design was adopted: census sector (selected
for stages 1, 2, and 3 of survey, randomly and
without replacement), households (selected from a systematic sampling process), and
residents (one resident selected randomly, using the “Sorteador de Nomes®”
applicative) [15].
