Among the 337 survey respondents, 240 are career civil servants.
About half of those are concentrated in two federal careers:
Specialist in Public Policy and Government Management (EPPG) and Technical
Analyst of Social Policy (ATPS). The concentration of respondents in
those two careers may help explain, as discussed later in
the article, the recourse to exit, as both careers, especially
the former, allow their members to move between federal institutions.
