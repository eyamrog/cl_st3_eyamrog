Also, the present work shows that there is no standardization
in the cataloguing of studies by higher educational institutions on
websites, despite CAPES administrative regulation 13/2006. Therefore, this study makes
two important contributions to the field of translation studies: the
mapping of theses and dissertations conducted in the field in
Brazil and the finding that the websites, which host Brazilian
scholarly works, should be standardized and regularly fed. The latter
could be achieved through a revision of CAPES administrative regulation
13/2006, which would, in turn, contribute substantially to other mapping
studies or bibliographic reviews in different areas.
