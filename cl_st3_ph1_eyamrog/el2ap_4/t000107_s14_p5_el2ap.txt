As a result, two other websites were included in our
study, namely the websites Biblioteca Digital de Teses e Dissertações
(BDTD; Digital Library of Dissertations and Theses)4 and Catálogo de
Teses e Dissertações da CAPES (CAPES Dissertations and Theses Catalog)5.
Both these websites aim to give access and visibility to
Brazilian theses and dissertations. The BDTD website is maintained by
the Brazilian Institute of Information in Science and Technology. On
its homepage, the user finds a simplified keyword search window
with four filter options, todos os campos (all fields), título
(title), autor (author), and assunto (topic) (Figure 2) as well
as an advanced search option with a greater variety of
filters (Figure 3).
