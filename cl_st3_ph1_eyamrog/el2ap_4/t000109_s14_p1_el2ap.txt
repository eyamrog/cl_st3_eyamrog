Repast [29] is a platform with a set of open
source modeling and simulation tools based on agents that runs
on different operating systems. For each experiment or new scenario
tested, a computer cluster is required to run several instances
of the model simultaneously, which generates results based on central
trends, given the stochastic nature of the phenomenon under study.
This platform allows the implementation of agentsâ€™ characteristics, behaviors and
interactions with each other and with their environments. The general
scheme of the model is presented in Figure 1, and
it shows different levels of detail. The first general level
represents the complete model (black block), with its initial conditions,
inputs and outputs. The second level shows the main blocks
of the system (blue blocks): a block for the simulation
of the spread of the virus for each host (left
side) and another for the transmission of the disease between
hosts (right side), as proposed by other authors [30]. The
next level (green blocks) shows the submodels of Epidemiological characterization
and Infectivity for each agent and their corresponding parameters. It
also presents Interpersonal contact, Location and Mobility/Activity submodels, and the
specific parameters for this submodel. Finally, the third level also
shows the Transport and Infectious trail submodels (magenta blocks). Each
submodel will be described in further detail in the following
sections.
