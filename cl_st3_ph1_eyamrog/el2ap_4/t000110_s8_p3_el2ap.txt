Diatoms have been widely used among the biological groups preserved
in the sediments, because of their taxonomic distinction, abundance, preservation
in the sediments, and rapid response to environmental changes (Reid
2005, Bennion & Simpson 2011). However, use of diatoms to
indicate environmental changes requires high taxonomic precision (Birks 1994), since
misidentifications may modify the interpretation in obtaining reliable data on
modern diatom biodiversity (Buczko & Magyari 2007, Wetzel & Ector
2014).
