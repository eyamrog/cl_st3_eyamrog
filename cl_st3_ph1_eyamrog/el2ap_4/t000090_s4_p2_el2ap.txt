Sometimes the “U-Multirank” makes a list of “best performers” by
country for a given year, which is not an easy
task for multidimensional rankings. We showed that there are several
ways to make such a general classification. The “U-Multirank” uses
an “Olympic Medals Table” format, considering the best ones as
the institutions that obtained the highest number of maximum scores.
The present paper showed some problems generated by this rule
and proposed two other forms to make this general ranking:
the simple average of all the Indicators and the average
of the Dimensions, which was considered better in the present
paper, because it uses all the data available and gives
the same weight to all the Dimensions. This point is
important, since some types of classification will be required if
multidimensional evaluation is used by Capes.
