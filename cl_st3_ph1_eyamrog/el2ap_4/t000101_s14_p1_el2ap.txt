As part of a larger, multi-­‐year research project, current and
former federal employees participated in an online survey and in
a 1-­‐1.5 hour semi-­‐structured interview conducted via Zoom.5 As indicated
above, the survey counted on 337 respondents, of which 129
have been interviewed. Research participants were not part of a
representative or purposive sample. The Brazilian government does not facilitate
access to databases with contact information of the federal bureaucracy,
therefore impeding the design of representative samples for research that
is not developed by government research institutions. Consequently, this research
project used a snow-­‐ball sample based on the promotion of
the survey via social media. The survey questionnaire was piloted
during the Summer of 2019 with a small group of
federal civil servants at Brazil’s National School of Public Administration
(ENAP). The initial questionnaire was also discussed with public policy
professors and researchers based in Brazil. After adjustments were made,
the survey was widely distributed.
