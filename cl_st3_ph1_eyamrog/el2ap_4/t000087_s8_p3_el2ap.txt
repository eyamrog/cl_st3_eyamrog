The BNT62b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccine was the first to be
authorized under emergency use for individuals over 16 years old
on December 11 2020 (Office of the Commissioner, 2021). On
March 31 2021, it was the first vaccine with published
results of its phase 3 on adolescents 12-15 years of
age, finding that it was well tolerated, safe, immunogenic and
had 100% efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 (Frenck et al.,
2021). However, there is not much information on the dynamic
of COVID-19 in adolescents, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, under conditions
that differ from those in an experimental trial.
