With the aim of achieving an approximate representation of locations
where citizens live, work, consume and perform leisure activities, GIS
tools included in Repast were used. This information, together with
movements verified during the day, configures the gregarious habits of
each Ha. These habits were determined through 441 individual field
surveys, complying with age and sex quotas, and with the
requirements of the Ethics Committee in charge of evaluating and
authorizing the structure, anonymization and informed consent of the surveys6.
