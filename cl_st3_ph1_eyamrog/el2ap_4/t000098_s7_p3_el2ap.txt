Comparisons between countries with different demographic sizes require considering rates
related to their populations. In the case of Covid-19, demographers
[GOLDSTEIN & LEE, 2020; HEUVELINE & TZEN, 2021; QUEIROZ et
al. 2020] insist, however, that the calculation of per capita
rates is absolutely insufficient for several purposes, such as comparing
the performance of the countries in coping with the disease.
The enormous disparity in Covid-19 case-fatality rates according to age
was recently summed up in a study based on data
from 45 countries, which estimated that they range from 0.001%
in the age group of 5 to 9 years to
8.29% for those aged 80 years or older [O'DRISCOLL et
al., 2021: 142]. On the other hand, there are also
huge differences between the age pyramids of the countries. The
comparison between the populations of Pakistan and Portugal provides an
extreme but enlightening example of the magnitude of these discrepancies.
Although the Pakistani population is 22 times larger than the
Portuguese population, there are more inhabitants in Portugal aged 90
years or older than in Pakistan.
