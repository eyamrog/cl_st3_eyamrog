Results: 806 articles were found. The duplicates and the ones
that did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded, thus,
17 articles remained for the review. The Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool
was used for the methodological evaluation of the studies classified
as having a ‘low risk’ of bias, which showed methodological
rigor. Aerobic exercises, endurance training, dance, Pilates, exercises guided by
applications and internet software were highlighted. Moderate intensity exercises were
evidenced, with a frequency of three times a week and
duration of 30 minutes. The great majority of the women
who participated in the interventions were between stages 0 and
III of the disease. The study protocols showed improvement with
regard to the physical aspects (physical fitness, physical activity level,
cognitive function and body composition), and psychological aspects (quality of
life, fatigue, depression and anxiety), which reinforces the use of
physical activities for this public.
