The literature review allowed us to identify two studies whose
central objectives were to promote adjustments in Covid-19 mortality rates
that are close to those proposed in this article. VILLANI
et al. (2020) calculated analogous age-standardized mortality rates, but for
only five European countries and based on data available up
to 8/30/2020. More recently, HEUVELINE and TZEN (2021) have undertaken
a much more geographically comprehensive effort, covering 186 countries and
some subnational units particularly affected by the pandemic. In contrast
to the wider geographical scope, this study allowed for a
less complete procedure of mortality rates adjustment. Indeed, the “indirect”
standardization they calculated neutralizes the effects of different age pyramids
on rates but assumes for all countries and localities the
same pattern of mortality by age group – in this
case, that observed in the USA. Even defending the procedure
adopted when the availability of data hinders the “direct” standardization,
the authors do not fail to recognize problems arising from
it, especially in the case of differences in mortality rates
between countries in the older age groups. It is precisely
the most complete adjustment procedure for a wide range of
countries that this article proposes to do.
