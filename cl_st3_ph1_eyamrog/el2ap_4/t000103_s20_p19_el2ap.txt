As we have reported in previous studies (Bruscato & Baptista,
2022a, 2022b), English native speakers do not seem to be
influenced by the order of the clauses or the salience
of the anaphor. They tend to interpret the anaphor as
corresponding to the subject of the main clause. Learners, on
the other hand, do not show a clear preferential interpretation.
They seem uncertain in most of the cases, except for
Brazilian advanced students, who seem to interpret the stressed pronoun
in subject position of the subordinate clause as corresponding to
the complement of the main clause; and Portuguese students, who
seem to interpret non-emphatic pronominal cataphora as corresponding to the
subject of the main clause.
