Next, on page 16, Emily appears in the park, and
it is Dad who pushes her on the swings âˆ’
she is foregrounded and appears on the right. The next
page refers to this action, where apart from the written
text on the right centred position, written on the grass,
we find Daddy and Max just observing the action of
Dad, and Emily on the swing. This is a very
clear example of Dad being active while Daddy just observes
the action of the other father.
