This is a clear example of a picturebook in which
the visual illustrates the message of the written text. In
fact, the story could be clearly understood just by looking
at the visuals because they show the main actions that
the written text narrates. Consequently, children will not have difficulty
understanding the story and observing how the visual and verbal
modes combine to reinforce the main meanings that the actions
by the characters communicate. The fact that there is no
fixed place for the written text (sometimes it appears before
the visuals and in other cases it is after them)
suggests that its place does not really affect the way
in which children understand the plot of the picturebook.
