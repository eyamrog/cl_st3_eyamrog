General characteristics for the whole studied population are described using
categorical and continuous data by frequency and percentage, and mean
and standard deviation (SD), respectively. Two different cohorts were created:
vaccinated and unvaccinated. Vaccinated were defined as individuals who had
received 1 or more doses of a COVID-19 vaccine at
the time of the event. Unvaccinated were defined as individuals
without any vaccine dose. We further describe how many adolescents
were fully vaccinated with all recommended doses administered more than
14 days prior to the event, and how many were
partially vaccinated.
