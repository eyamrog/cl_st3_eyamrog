Kava (also known as kava-kava) has been widely used during
the last decades. Kava kava gained popularity in western countries
due to its anxiolytic properties (Baek et al., 2014). Kavapirones
or kavalactones are the constituents of the kava-kava phytotherapeutic medicine.
This phytotherapeutic, in addition to anxiety control, is used to
modulate mood, functions as a skeletal muscle relaxant, and slightly
depresses CNS activity (Fajemiroye et al., 2016).
