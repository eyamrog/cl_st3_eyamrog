When learning a foreign language, Portuguese native speakers seem to
be influenced by their L1 anaphora resolution strategy (PAS) regardless
of their level of proficiency in the L2. In Spanish,
Brazilians again tend to interpret zero anaphora as corresponding to
the subject of the main clause more than Europeans do.
However, learners have shown some uncertainty to choose the antecedent
of the pronoun in Spanish (especially in cases of cataphora)
and in English.
