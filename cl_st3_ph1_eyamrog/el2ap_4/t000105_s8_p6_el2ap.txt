Therefore, immunochromatographic tests for antibody detection represent an important tool
for epidemiological surveillance services enabling the identification and interruption of
the virus transmission chain, subsidizing the health surveillance actions that
aim to increase monitoring and individual care, such as the
adoption of prevention measures [8-10]. Therefore, a seroepidemiological survey that
aimed to determine the prevalence and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection
in the population of two medium-sized Brazilian cities, in the
Inconfidentes region, and the subsequent socioeconomic and health effects, was
conducted. This paper describes the methodological procedures adopted and estimated
the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population studied.
