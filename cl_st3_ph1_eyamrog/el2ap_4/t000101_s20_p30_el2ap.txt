“In fact, there was much dismantling there [the Institute for
K] during the Bolsonaro administration. I should not say there
was, because it is still occurring. They started replacing superintendents
that had been very important, people with 30, 40 years
of dedication to policy K, high-­‐level individuals. They have been
replaced by movie-­‐makers, friends of members of Congress, etc. Various
directors have been fired in recent months (…) It is
widespread and objective dismantling and it is not just my
opinion, people are being replaced by anyone, you see? At
all levels. (…) It is a kind of change without
any project, that is what bothers me the most. If
you have a project that indeed won the elections and
you have control of the situation, that is normal, there
is no problem. This is politics, let’s discuss it. But
no, there is no project, the project is to dismantle
what has been done and this is very evident in
what has been happening at Institute K” (interviewee 35).
