The overall number of reported cases of COVID-19 by June
2021 in the state of SÃ£o Paulo is five times
the number notified by the state of Rio de Janeiro,
whereas the respective population is 2.6 times greater (about 44
million compared to 17 million inhabitants). Therefore, comparing the two
states and their capitals in relation to the characteristics and
evolution of hospitalized patients and deaths by COVID-19 may clarify
the high mortality rates observed in the state of Rio
de Janeiro.
