The second example shows a discussion on the use of
GPS for pedagogical purposes in Group 3. Participant B adds
his ideas to the topic and also gives positive feedback
to Participant Aâ€™s suggestions on how to integrate the GPS
in the classroom. Participant B uses both the Smirking Face
With Starry Eyes emoji and the Clapping Hands emoji to
support cognitive presence. These emojis illustrate the connection of ideas
during these discussions.
