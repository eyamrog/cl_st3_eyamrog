Educate Together rejects the fundamental premise that one specific religious
or philosophical outlook is necessary for a moral or ethical
purpose or for human well- being. The experience of our
schools has repeatedly proven the contrary. The Educate Together movement
has shown that once a school asserts a strong value
system of equality and human rights and builds a school
culture (or “ethos”) around this, it is perfectly able to
engage with the full educational and social needs of pupils
and to provide a rich, comprehensive and nourishing school experience
(Rowe, 2016).
