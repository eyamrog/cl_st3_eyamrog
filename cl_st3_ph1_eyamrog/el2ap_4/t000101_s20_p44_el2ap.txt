“Currently, there is a process of curtailing our individual freedom
to express as civil servants; there are various agencies in
which people are being persecuted for any kind of public
statement in opposition to the government. I remember, for instance,
that I used to go to street demonstrations, I had
my opinions, and I expressed myself on social media, in
protests, etc. Nowadays, I do not say anything anymore, because
I feel there is monitoring of what we say in
private forums. And there is real risk, political persecution is
the least that may happen” (interview 7).
