The Catálogo de Teses e Dissertações da CAPES (CAPES Catalog)
website catalogs theses and dissertations completed in higher education institutions
in Brazil, following the agency’s administrative regulation number 13/2006. Its
homepage has only one window for typing keywords and a
search button. There are, apparently, no filters available. However, after
a first search is conducted, the results page displays several
filters for an advanced search. These filters allow the user
to search by tipo (type), ano (year), autor (author), orientador
(supervisor), banca (evaluation committee), grande área de conhecimento (major knowledge
area), área de conhecimento (knowledge area), área de avaliação (evaluation
area) área de concentração (area of expertise), nome do programa
(graduate studies area), instituição (institution), and biblioteca (library). We started
our search in the CAPES Catalog website with the keyword
tradução (translation). As such action retrieved several thesis and dissertations
that were of no interest for this study, we used
the filters listed above to narrow down the list. We
also ran a search with the keywords tradução médica (medical
translation) and tradução de artigos científicos (translation of scientific articles)
using some (or none) of the filters, as the filter
options provided by the system varied according to the keywords
used.
