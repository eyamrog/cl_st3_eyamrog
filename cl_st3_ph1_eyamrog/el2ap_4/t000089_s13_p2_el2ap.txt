Among the proponents of the neutralist-liberal conception in Ireland are
organisations such as the Humanist Association of Ireland (HAI), the
Education Equality group and Atheist Ireland. Although they all share
the view that the educational system in Ireland has to
be reformed, so as to prevent discrimination in admission and
enforce children’s and parents’ rights of conscience, their proposals regarding
the study of religion at present are somewhat different in
nuance.
