Biomonitoring uses data on the distribution of organisms in each
habitat to diagnose the environment. Thus, the sampled organisms were
identified at the lowest possible taxonomic level with the aid
of identification keys. The method proposed by CETESB (2019) proposes
the attribution of points to each organism, according to their
sensitivity and tolerance to pollutants, being (5) sensitive species, (4)
indifferent, (3) tolerant, (2) second order opportunists and (1) first
order opportunists (BORJA et al., 2000; BORJA; MUXIKA:, 2005). A
biological index is then created from the sum of the
values to indicate the water quality, ranging from very poor,
poor, fair, good and excellent quality (BUSS, 2008; CETESB, 2019).
The determination of the indices allows the establishment of qualitative
comparisons between the sampling sites.
