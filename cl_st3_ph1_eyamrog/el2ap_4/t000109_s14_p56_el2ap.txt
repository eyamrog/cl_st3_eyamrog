Finally, in order to test the model against habits verified
for Argentine cities, a simulation was run with actual data
obtained from the district of Loncopué, Neuquén province10 11. For
this implementation not only local habits were considered, but also
a phase change of PMSI. Since the reported daily case
data for this city are compatible with the model outputs,
this information can be used as a measure of AbCSim
validity, thus defining the values presented in Table 1.
