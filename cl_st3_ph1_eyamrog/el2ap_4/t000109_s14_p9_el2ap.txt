Taking into account the aforementioned characteristics of human agents, this
submodel operates as follows: the susceptible Ha becomes infected with
a probability 𝛽 due to interpersonal contact with another infected
Ha either symptomatic (I) or asymptomatic (A). This probability of
infection is modulated by a variable v, dependent on daily
mean temperature. If the susceptible individual (S) becomes infected, Ha
becomes part of people exposed to the virus (E). Exposed
individuals, 1 𝛼 days later, become asymptomatic or symptomatic, according
to a characteristic probability 𝜂 , depending on Ha’s age
range. Once infected, there are two possibilities. The first option
is that Ha requires hospitalization (H) in intensive care unit
(ICU), with a certain probability 𝛾, according to Ha’s age
range, comorbidities and risk factors. Risk factors or comorbidities are
attributes of each Ha, and the increase in the probability
of moving to ICU that they represent is shown in
Table 2 in the following section (Epidemiological characterization submodel). If
Ha, after 1 𝜇 days is not transfered to ICU,
then it is considered recovered and not re-infected, at least
for an average period of 11 months, according to [32].
During the stay in ICU, individuals have a death probability
𝜔 [33] after an average period of 1 𝛹 days
[34][35]. After this period,4 Ha vacates the ICU bed and
moves to Recovered compartment.
