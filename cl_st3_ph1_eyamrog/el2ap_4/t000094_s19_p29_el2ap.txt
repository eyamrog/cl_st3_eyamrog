The pages where there is written text are given attention.
Regarding the visual, it is given importance by different patterns.
In some cases, there are characters following a centrifocal-polarised pattern
because they are in two different corners of the following
pages: 7, 11, 16, 20, 23, 27, and 28. However,
there are other cases where characters are represented in lines,
following the iterating: aligned pattern, as in pages 8, 12,
15, 19, and 24. When characters are represented in lines,
they consist of a single focus of attention. But when
the pattern is centrifocal-polarised, there are different focuses of attention
joined by vectors.
