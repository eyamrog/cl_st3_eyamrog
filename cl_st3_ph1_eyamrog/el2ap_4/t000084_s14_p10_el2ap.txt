Upon completion of the coding, it was discovered that 117
unique emojis were used by the participants during the 8-week
course. In order to answer the first research question and
determine the types of emojis used to support cognitive, social,
and teaching presence that occurred during the interactions in the
course, frequencies were then computed on each emoji type. More
specifically, within each group, the number of times each type
of emoji was used (e.g., or ) was counted and
summed for each CoI category (e.g., Triggering Event or Emotional
Expression). Emoji use for each CoI category was then combined
to produce a total count for each CoI element (or
presence type; see Table 1). This was done for each
of the six groups, and then all six groups were
combined to produce the total number. In other words, for
each unique emoji, tallies were computed within and across the
six groups for each CoI category. Each CoI category was
then grouped into the CoI Element (i.e., cognitive, teaching, or
social) to give the total number of times the emoji
was used for each presence. Upon completion, a total of
2,079 emojis were used across the groups to represent cognitive,
teaching, and social presence during the course. Emoji clouds were
created to visually present the data. Additionally, rich descriptions from
the text (WhatsApp course interactions) were included to support how
the various emojis were used to support each presence.
