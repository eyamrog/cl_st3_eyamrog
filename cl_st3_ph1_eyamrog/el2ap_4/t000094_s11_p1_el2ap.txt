Following Halliday (1978, p.27), language is understood as ‘meaning potential’
due to the fact that the communicative situation will determine
speakers’ choices. Consequently, text and context are interrelated and language
is seen as social semiotics (Halliday, 1978). Thus, semiotic resources
are “system (s) of meanings” that constitute “the ‘reality’ of
a culture” (Halliday, 1978, p.123).
