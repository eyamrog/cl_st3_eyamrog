These results show that the average of Dimensions varies very
much for each Academic Institution, because they do not have
homogeneous performances in all the Dimensions, even for the European
countries. It indicates that making a general classification is really
not a good idea, because it will hide a diverse
performance and there are no reasons to consider one Dimension
better than the others, at least in general.
