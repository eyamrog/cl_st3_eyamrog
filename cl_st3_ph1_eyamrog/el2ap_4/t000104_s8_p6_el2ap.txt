The Brazilian System of Protected Areas (which acronym is SNUC)
includes, within its objectives, the development of means and incentives
for scientific research and environmental monitoring (BRASIL, 2000). One of
the tools that can be used to achieve these objectives
is the biomonitoring, which consists of assessing bioindicator organisms or
communities, i.e., identifying the presence of organisms that have known
tolerance ranges to pollutants, according to the literature (PHILLIPS; RAINBOW:,
2013). A commonly used form of biomonitoring is the analysis
of the benthic macrofauna, through the taxonomic identification of macroinvertebrates
to assess water quality, in view of the responses to
the environmental variations provided by these organisms (PIEDRAS et al,
2006). Macroinvertebrates are organisms of high ecological importance and represent
important links within the food chain. Because they are found
associated with the substrate, submerged vegetation and/or water column, and
are sensitive to environmental changes, they are commonly used to
monitor the quality of water bodies around the world (FRANÃ‡A;
CALLISTO:, 2012). There is a range of protocols available for
biomonitoring of watersheds through microbenthic communities (MORSE et al., 2007;
BUSS, 2008).
