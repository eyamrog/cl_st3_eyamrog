Much of the reported literature on modeling and simulation of
epidemics, in particular COVID-19, proposes global models based on differential
equations of SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered) type or similar
ones, with their different variants adapted to this disease [14][15].
However, the epidemic modeling community has been using local or
fine-grained models [16], including agent-based models (ABM) [10][13][17][18], such as
the one used in this work. These models allow greater
expressiveness and control of different aspects of the epidemic, the
inclusion of the randomness inherent in these systems, and the
possibility of time-space monitoring of the simulation runs [10][11][19]. On
the other hand, they require greater computational power and access
to a large amount of local data in order to
be adapted to particular situations.
