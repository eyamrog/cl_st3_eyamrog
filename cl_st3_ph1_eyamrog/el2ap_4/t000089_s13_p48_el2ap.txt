In Cornwall, the justification of the priority of Christianity over
other faith traditions is explained in view of the fact
that it articulates moral perceptions and provides a set of
meanings that informs society’s way of life: “Christianity shapes the
lives of all citizens of the United Kingdom irrespective of
their individual beliefs. Christianity shapes our year, our language and
our culture. It continues to inform our moral perspectives” (United
Kingdom: Cornwall Council, 2014, p. 12). In considering the development
of other faith traditions, it draws special attention to particular
features of local groups and their historical development, promoting an
attitude of ethical enquiry based on communal experiences. For example,
whilst acknowledging that Buddhism is the largest non-Christian tradition in
Cornwall, the document points out that the majority of those
who identify themselves with that faith were not born into
the Buddhist tradition. As a consequence, teachers and pupils should
be questioning why that religion became so popular, besides looking
into the links of Cornish Buddhism with other versions of
that tradition as found in Asian contexts.
