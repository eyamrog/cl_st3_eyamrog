Showing contact or expressing affection is associated with new forms
of masculinities. The reinforcement of an egalitarian masculinity is essential
to create new family models that are far from the
classical model of hegemonic masculinity, which has been present quite
often in classical heterosexual families. In fact, the construal and
representation of new masculinities, both in heterosexual and in homosexual
couples, constitutes a challenge for the patriarchal system, which is
mainly based on a social structure that gives more power
and privileges to men and an ideology that justifies the
said social structure.
