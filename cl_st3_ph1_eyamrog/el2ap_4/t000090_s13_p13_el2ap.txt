To give an idea of the effects of using the
rules defined by the “U-Multirank”, Figure 2 shows the average
of the Dimensions, in the vertical axis, as a function
of the position of the Academic Institution as given by
the “U-Multirank” in the horizontal axis. All the 1070 European
Academic Institutions listed in the 2020 version are considered for
this study. Of course there is a tendency of higher
averages for the best performers, but the correlation is not
strong, as clearly seen in Figure 2. Many Institutions with
grades above 2.5 are among the last 300 hundred positions
in the general ranking. It shows that the rules defined
by the “U- Multirank” need to be considered with caution,
and even be revised.
