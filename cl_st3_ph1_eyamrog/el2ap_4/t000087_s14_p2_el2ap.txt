We sent a questionnaire to all the high school adolescents
invited to the private event (N=199). Only those that attended
the event were included in the study (N=164). Informed consent
was requested at the start of the questionnaire. For those
under 18 informed consent was asked from one of the
parents based on guidelines from the WHO (World Health Organization,
2021). We emphasized that participation in the study was anonymous
and voluntary, and we held an open virtual meeting with
adolescents and their parents to share the objectives and methods
of this study. The questionnaire included close-choice items and one
open-ended question. We collected data on age, sex, prior COVID-19
infection, status of the COVID-19 rapid antigen test before the
event, result of the COVID-19 test after the event, the
use of face masks, the amount of time spent at
the event, vaccination status, symptoms after the event, and people
from their close contacts that developed COVID-19 after the event.
