An informative folder was attached in the door to randomly
selected household, indicating that that household had been selected for
the collection which would take place during the weekend. Taking
into consideration the possibility of loss (refusal or closed household),
an informative folder was attached to the neighbors on the
left and right of the selected household (Appendix 2).
