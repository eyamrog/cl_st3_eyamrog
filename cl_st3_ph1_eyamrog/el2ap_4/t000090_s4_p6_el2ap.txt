Based on the “top 300 performers” in Europe in 2020,
it is possible to say that the Dimensions and Indicators
selected by the “U-Multirank” make a good set of elements
to evaluate Academic Institutions, with not many cases of redundancy
in the measurements. The multidimensional approach introduced by the “U-Multirank”
is very important, because the majority of the Institutions do
not have homogeneous performances in all the Dimensions, and general
classifications would hide those strong differences.
