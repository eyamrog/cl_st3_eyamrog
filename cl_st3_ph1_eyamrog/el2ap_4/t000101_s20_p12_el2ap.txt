“All civil servants [of my former department] left and went
to other departments. I negotiated my transfer to another area,

(…) You keep trying to find a place where it
is possible to survive, right? This is the feeling that
I have. (...) So I think my decision to move

where it is possible to work with some sense of
dignity, that is the bottom line” (interview 8).
