In addition to the SUS underfunding, the Covid-19 epidemic increased
the costs of health services. The expenditure associated with the
average length of stay in hospital for COVID-19 treatment had
the highest mean total amount spent in the South region
of Brazil compared to the other ones, but in Rio
de Janeiro the cost was almost half of the South
region mean and Rio de Janeiro had also higher lethality
rate 13.
