Dad appears next to her drawing like Emily. On page
11, it is Daddy who plays with Emily (“I spray
my Daddy with the hose, until it runs between his
toes”). Moreover, apart from observing Emily while she is painting,
he looks at her while she is serving tea, page
15, and while Emily is on the swing, page 17.
Daddy is also located behind Emily, protecting her, while they
are in the stream, on page 20. He is also
the one behind Emily when both fathers are represented running
with Emily on page 23, whereas Dad is represented running
right after Max, the dog. However, on page 24 there
is a change in the picturebook, because it is Dad
who appears on the right, trying to catch Emily while
Daddy observes. In this picture, it is the dog that
is foregrounded.
