The second and most important contribution is the calculation of
adjusted mortality rates based on mortality rates by age group
and the age profile of populations. This adjustment was previously
indicated by demographers who focused on the subject [QUEIROZ et
al. 2020: 3689]. It is essential to filter the effect
of disparities in age pyramids and to enable the appropriate
use of mortality rates in assessing the success or failure
of measures to address the pandemic [GOLDSTEIN & LEE, 2020:
5]. In fact, at least two previous studies have attempted
to move in this direction. Notwithstanding, whether due to the
broader spatial and temporal scope in relation to one of
them [VILLANI et al., 2020] or to the methodologically more
complete procedure in relation to the other [HEUVELINE & TZEN,
2021], we can argue that our results in this article
offer important developments. From them, one can infer an international
ranking of Covid-19 mortality very different from that based on
crude rates. More than that, adjusted rates reveal that the
“protective” effect of younger demographic profiles on populations in poorer
countries [GUILMOTO, 2020: 8; DOWD et al, 2020: 9,697], at
least in the case of several Latin American countries and
South Africa, was not enough to prevent these countries from
staging some of the more dramatic impacts of the pandemic.
The primary explanation for this is the existence, identified in
this article, of rather different mortality patterns by age in
developing countries and, more specifically, the higher mortality in lower
age groups.
