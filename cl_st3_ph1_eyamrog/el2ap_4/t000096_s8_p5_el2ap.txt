Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the importance of using
educational platforms to address emerging remote education situations (Crick et
al. 2020). The obligatory confinement made on-site/in-person work unfeasible, as
happened in Ecuador, a Latin American country, where remote education
for all educational levels was adopted. Something that, in itself,
confirmed the importance of online learning as a requirement for
the development of knowledge in the 21st century (Meier 2021).
