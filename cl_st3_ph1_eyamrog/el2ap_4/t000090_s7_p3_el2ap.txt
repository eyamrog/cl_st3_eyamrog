A multidimensional evaluation in academic institutions, as considered by CAPES
nowadays, is not a new idea. This concept appeared in
Europe in 2008 and a multidimensional ranking was proposed (VAN
VUGHT and ZIEGELE, 2012). Aspects related to which Dimensions and
Indicators must be used are very important, as well as
to take a first look at the level of independence
of those Dimensions and Indicators. The current evaluation made by
CAPES is focused on the Dimension “Research” of the “U-Multirank”,
so it is interesting to see the correlations of this
Dimension with other dimensions, to have at least a rough
estimate about what may happen in a multidimensional evaluation when
made in Brazil.
