It should be noted, therefore, that both the Learn Together
curriculum and the Diversity and Citizenship in the Curriculum report
err in reducing the aims of the ethical curriculum to
the mere expression of different worldviews. In pursuing this approach,
they eschew ethical questions of truth and moral validity, assuming
that a common concern with equality and human rights would
bring about social cohesion, despite the emergence of conflicting narratives.
Indeed, in emphasising the idea of common links between religions,
and evoking notions of human rights, these documents tend to
assume a postmodern perspective, the orientation of which bears some
resemblances with some protestant schools of educational thinking of the
nineteenth century – especially those associated with Friedrich Schleiermacher’s theological
framework, which emphasises experiences over conceptual knowledge – that allows
for a view of religious diversity as merely linguistic versions
of common human phenomena (Barnes, 2007, p. 325-326). This view
underestimates the self-constitutive character of cultural schemes of reason, since
different philosophical and cultural schemes cannot help but lead to
incompatible moral claims.
