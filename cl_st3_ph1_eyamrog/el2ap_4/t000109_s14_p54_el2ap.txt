Based on the values proposed by the literature [31], an
initial calibration of parameters linked mainly to virus spread in
the hosts was generated. To adjust the parameters values of
virus spread in the host, information on the evolution of
epidemic variables from March to May 2020 in the municipality
of Vo (small village in northern Italy) [46] was used
and, in addition, the geographical, climatic, demographic and habits data
of its inhabitants8.
