To keep the constant supply of environmental goods and services
by the ecosystem processes, a good quality of water is
required. However, 53% of Brazilian cities show a reduction in
the quality and quantity of water resources, 38% of which
are affected by water pollution (CAMPANILI et al., 2010). In
developing countries, such as Brazil, domestic, industrial effluents or agricultural
runoff are frequently discharged into water bodies without effective treatment
(SNIS, 2017). The massive presence of contaminants in the water
causes the degradation of the riverine ecosystems; besides, the decomposition
of organic matter from sewage and industrial effluents leads to
a decrease in the dissolved oxygen levels, affecting aquatic species
(CETESB, 2019). Furthermore, fertilizers, which have a large amount of
phosphorus in their composition, contribute to induce or increase the
eutrophication process and the disordered growth of algae, including those
capable of producing and releasing toxic substances into the water
(BARRETO et al., 2013). The disposal of other chemical pollutants,
such as drugs, pesticides, and pharmaceutical and personal care products
(PPCPs), associated with sewage, industrial wastes, and agricultural systems, aggravates
the contamination of waters (Khan, 1977; Liu et al., 2013).
In addition, the natural flow of rivers favors the transport
of pollutants over long distances, reaching environments far from the
source (ABESSA et al., 2018).
