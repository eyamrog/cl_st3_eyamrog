Survey respondents were asked to provide their email address if
they agreed to be contacted for a follow-­‐up interview. Interviews
were conducted during the Spring of 2021, therefore over two
years after Bolsonaro had taken office. The interviews were particularly
telling for the purpose of the research questions raised in
this paper. Various interviewees, particularly those still in the federal
government, had to be provided with several reassurances that their
identities would not be revealed. This led the research team
to take several precautions to erase identifiable information in all
data sources. Some interviewees would open up only at the
end of the interview and after the structured questions had
been asked, only then disclosing their perceptions and revealing current
challenges.
