As has been pointed out by Mawhinney (2007) and Fischer
(2016), the Irish educational system is inadequate in terms of
democratic pluralism in view of its reliance on denominational schools
to attend the needs of public schooling, which results in
discriminatory policies of enrolment and ethos enforcement. Insofar as parents
of children with different religious or secular orientation are not
given fair opportunities of choice and have their children exposed
to a monological process of faith induction, liberal criticism to
current state policies is valid to a certain point, since
– even though Ireland may not be in breach of
European human rights laws – they fail to meet the
requirements of communicative rationality. .
