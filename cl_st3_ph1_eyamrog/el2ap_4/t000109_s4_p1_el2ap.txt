This work presents an agent-based model called AbCSim, capable of
reproducing the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic at a local
city scale. The model explicitly incorporates various aspects of the
epidemic, which facilitates its adjustment to different case studies. The
methodology used to adjust the system's parameters is provided, as
well as the methodology to consider changes in social distancing
measures, in people's activity and climate variations over time. As
a case study, the model was applied to Paran√° city
in the second half of 2020.
