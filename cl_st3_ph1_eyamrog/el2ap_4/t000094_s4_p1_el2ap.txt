When children read picturebooks like the one analysed in this
article, they are exposed to new family models in their
socialization process. Representing the girl, who is the protagonist of
the story, doing actions with her two fathers that any
other child could do with a heterosexual couple, such as
cooking, playing, and running, contributes to the normalization of this
type of family. This reinforces an alternative gender ideology where
different types of families are normalised. The balance between the
actions that take place inside and outside home also contribute
to normalize the life of the family represented in the
picturebook.
