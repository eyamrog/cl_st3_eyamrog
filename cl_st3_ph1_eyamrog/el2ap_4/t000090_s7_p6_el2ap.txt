Since the “U-Multirank” has a much larger number of Indicators
(36), when compared to one-dimensional rankings, which usually have less
than 15 Indicators, it is expected that a lack of
data may be a potential problem, which could be a
negative point of this ranking. Of course this is not
as important as it is for one-dimensional rankings, since a
general classification is not made, and the user can just
neglect the missing information and concentrate in the available data,
loosing part of the information, but not the whole ranking.
But the amount of missing data is not negligible in
many situations and the present paper will look at this
point later.
