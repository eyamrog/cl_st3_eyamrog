Second, in reference to the study of demand developed in
a previous phase, which also justifies the proposal of this
master, an online questionnaire was applied to 130 people (teachers
and graduates in the field of education), which was distributed
via email. It was determined that 90% of the respondents
would like to take a master's program related to ICT-mediated
learning management and 49% are interested in studying that program
online.
