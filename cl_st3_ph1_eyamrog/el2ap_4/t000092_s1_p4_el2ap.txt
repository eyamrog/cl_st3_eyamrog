Discussion: The high and low frequency components known as HF
(High Frequency) representing predominantly parasympathetic function, and LF (Low Frequency)
which is both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity; can be obtained
through the analysis in the frequency domain. The relationship between
these two elements would thus represent the sympatho-vagal balance and
is expressed as the LF / HF ratio. We observed
that 41.2% of the studied patients showed elevated LF /
HF ratio
