The visual representation of the two fathers suggests that they
have different personalities and different roles when taking care of
the child: Daddy is represented smiling, whereas Dad appears more
serious. Moreover, the fact that Dad wears a blue shirt
suggests that he has a masculine role. This blue shirt
clearly foregrounds masculinity on page 19, when Dad is in
a pirate costume, which contrasts with the pink costume worn
by Daddy, clearly giving him a more feminine role. As
already mentioned, colour is a textual strategy that contributes to
the creation of meaning, following Painter et al. (2013, p.35),
“[…] a colour may be used cohesively as a kind
of visual rhyme to link different parts of a narrative”.
