This is a mixed-­‐methods research project initiated in the Summer
of 2019, six months after the inauguration of Jair Bolsonaro
in the Brazilian presidency. Data collection covered the span of
two years and involved a snow-­‐ball survey with 337 former
and current federal employees, of whom 129 were part of
semi-­‐structured interviews of 1 to 1.5 hours. Participants were asked
about their personal trajectories and career decisions. They were not
asked directly about policy dismantling. Reported data represents information that
respondents volunteered to the interviewing research team. Interviews were coded
and analyzed with the aid of the NVivo software.
