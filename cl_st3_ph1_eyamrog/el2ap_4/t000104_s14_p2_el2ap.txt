The creation of rules for disciplining the use of the
site to avoid adverse impacts is a necessary action, considering
that tourism, even if classified as ecotourism can still constitute
a potentially impacting activity (RUSCHMANN, 1993). In this context, contamination
of water bodies by tourists can occur from the use
of products such as sunscreens, repellents, moisturizing creams, solid waste,
silting and others (RUSCHMANN, 1993). The present study aims to
assess water quality at Cachoeira do Paraíso waterfall (Peruíbe, SP,
Brazil), based on the biomonitoring of benthic macrofauna.
