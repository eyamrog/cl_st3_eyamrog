As it was stated in the Introduction, the purpose of
this study is to determine: (a) how ambiguity resolution strategies
differ in English, Spanish, and Portuguese; (b) how L2 learners
are influenced by their L1 regarding ambiguity resolution; and whether
(c) the order of the main and subordinate clauses, (d)
the salience of the anaphor, or (e) the lexical choice
of verbs may affect this process.
