Ambiguity is a classic problem in anaphora resolution, and a
considerable amount of literature has been published on this subject
(Alonso-Ovalle et al., 2002; Keating et al., 2011; Lobo &
Silva, 2016; Sorace & Filiaci, 2006; Valenzuela et al., 2011).
These studies tried to explain how L1 and L2 speakers
solve ambiguity in different languages, but to date there has
been little agreement on what theory would better describe this
phenomenon.
