The strengths of this study are the high rate of
participation, that almost all were tested for COVID- 19 before
and after the event, and that the conditions during which
the private event was held were constant for most of
the attendees. The limitations of this study are that it
was not possible to sequence all COVID-19 positive adolescents to
determine if they all had the Delta variant and not
all of the vaccinated individuals were fully vaccinated. Future studies
are needed to determine the incidence of COVID-19 in adolescents
in fully vaccinated individuals in bigger samples to be able
to determine if the incidence is similar to what is
observed in this smaller population and if the symptoms of
vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals are similar.
