This form of studies is also highly valued at present,
since during 2020 and until the date of submission of
this paper, due to the global pandemic of COVID-19, the
whole world adopted an emerging mediated form of education by
technologies, where the need for teachers to have knowledge for
an adequate use and integration of ICT in learning processes
is constantly evident. Therefore, a postgraduate program where ICT-mediated learning
has been designed. The curriculum design proposal includes lines of
study which must be analyzed from a holistic and integrative
perspection such as: digital literacy for the new society; teaching
in new digital environments; the design and development of content
and digital resources for learning; new ways of learning and
innovating in education; and, of course, research in educational technology.
Finally, it is essential that in this type of curricular
proposals that involve the use and exploitation of ICT in
learning, due to the same level of updating and improvement
that they experience, flexible study modules are incorporated, so that
future cohorts can adapt its curricular contents to the constant
innovations and trends in the use of technologies in learning.
