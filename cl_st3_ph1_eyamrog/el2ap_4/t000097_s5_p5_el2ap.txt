Current modalities seen in the protocols, that is, exercises performed
at home with interventions using electronics, such as watches to
monitor physical activity, internet software and smartphone applications, have been
encouraged for providing changes in living standards, especially considering the
pandemic and relocation of professional activities for home-office. In other
previously studies, such as that by Dong et al10, the
findings of an intervention based on combined exercises of an
internet software showed positive effects on muscle strength and quality
of life in patients during breast cancer postoperative period. Galiano-Castillo
et al66 indicated a physical exercise program that uses an
Internet software, through which it was possible to improve and
maintain the quality of life of breast cancer patients, as
well as to reduce pain and fatigue, and improve muscle
strength, which resulted in improved functionality related to daily activities.
These strategies, such as the use of online tools and
the fact that the interventions are carried out at home,
can be adequate alternatives to assist both, researchers and participants,
since they provide a larger network for a great number
of participants. The current moment, with the recommendations for staying
at home, has led us to increase the demand for
digital tools, in addition to raising peopleâ€™s awareness on how
much these methods can be explored. It would not be
possible to carry out the interventions without such tools. Problems
related to the capability of some software, the lack of
skills to use the applications, difficulties in accessing the Internet
and a possible lack of interest by the participants are
likely to be limitations. However, these strategies can work as
a useful tool in changing behavior, besides facilitating and bringing
the researchers and participants closer together67.
