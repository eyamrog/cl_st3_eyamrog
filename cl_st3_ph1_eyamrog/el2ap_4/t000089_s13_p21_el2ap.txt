The pragmatist/postmodern educational framework has the advantage of taking into
account pupilsâ€™ particular experiences in faith activities as a starting
point for the educative endeavour. Nevertheless, while this account also
departs from the objectivism of liberal positions, it also fails
to provide an epistemological or even an ontological foundation for
systematic procedures of critical thinking and self-criticism. Indeed, with its
emphasis on the individual and social utility of self-oriented practices,
and its disregard for an all-encompassing account of public morality,
this perspective cannot help falling into the paradox of an
autonomous thinking agent that, in exercising its own freedom, may
opt for disengagement and adopt a conservative stance on ethical
and moral matters
