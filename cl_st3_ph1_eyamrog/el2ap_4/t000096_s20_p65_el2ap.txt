In this way, it is important that teachers are prepared
to train new generations, which is why the need arises
to generate training processes to develop digital skills that allow
to facilitate and manage learning, evaluate adequately with the support
of ICT, integrate didactic strategies to innovate in classrooms, promote
educational research, and be in constant reflection and preparation (Professional
Development), for its proper integration into teaching practice (Gutiérrez, Prendes
& Castañeda 2015).
