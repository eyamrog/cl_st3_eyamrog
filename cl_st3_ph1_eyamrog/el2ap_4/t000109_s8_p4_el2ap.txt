ABM are computational modeling and simulation methods used to study
the organization and dynamics of complex systems. They consist of
an artificial society integrated by autonomous and heterogeneous agents that
interact in a non-trivial way with each other and with
the environment, according to certain rules, forming a social architecture.
The social aspect is given by the heterogeneity, autonomy, interdependence,
and social embedding that characterize the computational agents [20]. To
our knowledge, few models with this characteristics have been applied
to COVID-19 [10][11][21][22][23]. Furthermore, most of these models have been
designed for specific situations in some region or country and
it is difficult to extrapolate them to new particular situations,
as lot of scientific and technical knowledge is required for
this purpose.
