Infectivity submodel makes behavior of Ha change according to its
epidemiological compartment. If Ha is in the Susceptible compartment, then
Ha meets the daily activities and movements pre-established as attributes
and defined by Mobility submodel. However, if Ha is in
a compartment different from Susceptible or Exposed, then Ha stops
moving, since it is assumed that it remains at home
to avoid transmiting the disease to other Ha. From that
moment on, the household members are in the Exposed compartment.
