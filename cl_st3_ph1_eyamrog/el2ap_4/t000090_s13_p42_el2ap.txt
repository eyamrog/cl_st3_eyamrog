The results show that there is only one “very strong”
correlation, for the Indicators “Citation Rate” and “Top Cited Publications”.
They have a correlation index of 0.9402, indicating near perfect
positive relation. It means that the Institutions that have more
citations are also the ones who have the most cited
publications. This fact is not surprising, but the high value
of this index says that we are getting nearly the
same ranking in both Indicators and those Indicators are redundant.
