The Position of Antecedent Strategy was not confirmed with Spanish
nor with English native speakers. Both native groups tend to

the subject of the main clause, though Spanish native speakers
have a stronger preference to establish that correspondence in cases
of zero anaphora rather than of pronominal anaphora.
