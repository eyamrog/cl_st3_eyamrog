The assumption that policy change is always needed in developing
countries has fallen apart in places where far-­‐right governments have
praised the dismantling of previously existing progressive policies. This phenomenon
has not been exclusive to developing countries. It has ranged
from immigration policy in the United States under Trump; to
criminal and drug policy in the Philippines under Duterte; to
environmental, social, human rights, and education policies in Brazil under
Bolsonaro.
