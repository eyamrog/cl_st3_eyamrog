The analysis evinces that face emojis are very much used
as social affective manifestations that are oftentimes intertwined in the
interactions coded as cognitive and teaching presence. This supports the
findings of Garrison at al. (2007), Molinari (2010), Celani and
Collins (2005), and Beuchot and Bullen (2005), who view social
presence as a foundation for cognitive presence. Thus, it is
possible to affirm that emojis, like written discourse and emoticons,
are elements in online interactions that may support cognitive presence.
