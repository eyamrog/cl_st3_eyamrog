Data from Portuguese and Brazilian speakers who study English or
Spanish in a Brazilian or a Portuguese university are compared
to data from native speakers of these languages. They volunteered
to answer an online questionnaire that tested their proficiency level
in the L2 and asked them to identify the subject
of ambiguous sentences in their L1 and L2.
