The Itinguçu State Park (PEIT) is one of the protected
areas comprised in the mosaic, and includes the Cachoeira do
Paraíso waterfall, which it is formed along the flow of
the Itinguçu river. So far, the biota of the region
includes 29 species of fish, divided into 12 families, in
addition to insects, lizards, squirrels, snakes, sloths and others (MAGINI;
ABESSA:, 2017). The waterfall is the main tourist attraction in
the region, having the highest peak of visitation in the
summer. In 2008, for example, the site received 45,217 visitors
(SMA, 2009), which led the authorities to reduce the visitation
by the establishment of limits for the daily number of
visitors, until further studies could assist the park in defining
the maximum number of visitors (MAGINI and ABESSA, 2017).
