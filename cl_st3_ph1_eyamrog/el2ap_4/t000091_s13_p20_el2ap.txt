Studies have also shown that the use of Valeriana officinalis
extracts does not produce side effects, such as dizziness, gastrointestinal
problems, allergy, or the paradoxical effect (Pinheiro et al., 2014).
Additionally, Yao et al. (2007) verified that the ethanolic extract
of V. officinallis did not have adverse effects on embryonic
development and fertility of rodents.
