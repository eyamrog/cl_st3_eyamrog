We have concluded that Portuguese native speakers seem to follow
the Position of Antecedent Strategy to resolve ambiguous anaphora and
that Brazilian speakers tend to interpret zero anaphora as corresponding
to the subject of the main clause more than Europeans
do. For participants from both varieties, however, it seems that
pronominal cataphora is more difficult to resolve than the other
types of anaphora. Although most of the participants only chose
the subject or the complement of the main clause as
the antecedent of the anaphor, some of them chose another
referent (which was not previously stated in the sentence) as
the antecedent in cases of pronominal cataphora, as it had
been observed before in Italian by Sorace and Filiaci (2006).
