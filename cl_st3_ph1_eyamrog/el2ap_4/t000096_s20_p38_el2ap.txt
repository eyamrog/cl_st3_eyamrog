Throughout the years, education has been a controversial issue due
to the connotations that are generated around it (psycho-pedagogical, social,
cultural), and even more, in a time when students are
different, and in turn, demand for another type of educational
system with teachers who master the didactic knowledge of the
content, in an attempt to improve the relationship between these
two parties (teacher-student) (Imbern√≥n 2014).
