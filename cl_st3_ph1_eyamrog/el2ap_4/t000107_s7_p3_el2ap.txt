This study draws on the discipline of translation studies. It
is one of the investigations conducted by the MapTrad research
group1 and falls within the Bibliometric Mapping in Translation Studies2
line of research. Its primary objective is to map master’s,
doctoral, and post-doctoral studies on medical translation in Brazil, identifying
the topics covered, the institutions, and the geographic regions of
such studies. We believe that the mapping of translation studies
can potentially help students and researchers – who are interested
in working with the translation of texts in the medical
field – choose study centers and lines of research as
well as guide policies toward a better distribution of resources
to the development of translation studies in Brazil.
