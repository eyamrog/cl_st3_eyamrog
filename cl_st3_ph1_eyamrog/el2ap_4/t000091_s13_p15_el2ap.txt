A double-blind clinical trial assessed the level of anxiety of
women undergoing hysterosalpingography, a stressful and painful procedure, after using
the herb in capsules. In this study, three valeric capsules
containing 500 mg were given in a single dose (1,500
mg total), along with prophylaxis, 30 minutes before the procedure.
They found that the valeric drug was effective in reducing
anxiety in women undergoing this test (Gharib et al., 2015).
