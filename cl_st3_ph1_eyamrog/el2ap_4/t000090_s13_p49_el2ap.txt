There are also four “moderate” correlations, as shown in Table
6. The average of the magnitude of all the Indicators
of this Dimension is 0.2722 and the standard deviation is
0.1985, which also shows that this Dimension has a good
group of Indicators, with only one redundancy out of seven
Indicators, in the group of Institutions used here.
