Despite the homogeneity of the benthic macrofauna assemblies among the
3 sampling sites, some minor aspects were explicit in the
cluster analysis. First, in general there was a good similarity
between replicates; and second, the sampling sites tended to exhibit
subtle differences, as shown in Figure 2. The causes of
such differences are unknown and can be related with natural
factors (such as hydrogeochemical characteristics) or even anthropic factors (pollution
or trampling).
