Examples (1) and (2) have pronominal anaphora since the anaphor
is a pronoun. In Spanish or Portuguese, however, there is
no need to use a pronoun in the subject position
of the subordinate clause if the antecedent is also in
the subject position of the main clause. These languages are
called pro-drop languages, also known as null subject languages (Chomsky,
1981; Rizzi, 1982). They allow null or zero anaphora when
the antecedent is grammatically or pragmatically inferable, as seen in
(3).
