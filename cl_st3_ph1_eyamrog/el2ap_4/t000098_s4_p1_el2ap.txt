This article presents two main contributions to the analysis of
the planetary spread of Covid- 19. The first is the
systematisation of data on mortality rates by age group for
a set of 28 countries that, on 1/28/2021, concentrated 82%
of deaths because of the disease. This is a valuable
result in itself, since no source is known to have
already published age-disaggregated information with the same geographical coverage. Based
on them, we can infer whether the notorious growth of
lethality with age is the same everywhere, an interrogation launched,
for example, by VILLANI et al. (2020). As we have
seen, there are important differences between countries and at least
three patterns are discernible.
