Grundmann et al. (2008) carried out a research with the
objective of evaluating the anxiolytic properties of a commercial extract
phytochemically characterized from Passiflora incarnata in the elevated plus maze
test in mice. After oral administration, the extract exerted an
anxiolytic effect, which was comparable to that of diazepam (1.5
mg/Kg) at a dose of 375 mg/Kg and exhibited a
U-shaped dose- response curve. In addition, they performed antagonistic studies
using the antagonist flumazenil for the GABA/benzodiazepine receptors and the
antagonist WAY-100635 for the 5-HT1A receptor. The active dose was
effectively antagonized by flumazenil, but not by WAY-100635. This study
was the first in vivo demonstration of the GABA-mediated anxiolytic
activity of an extract of Passiflora incarnata.
