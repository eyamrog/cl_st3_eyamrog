Two study protocols assessed in this scoping review included interventions
through dance36,50. Others, such as the ones by Loo et
al62 and Ho et al63 showed that dance practice enabled
to achieve an increased physical activity in breast cancer survivors.
The quality of life was also improved by increasing vigor
and reducing problems associated with obesity, and reducing stress and
pain in these women. Considering the interventions with Pilates, the
study by Eyigor et al64 showed that such a method
is a safe and effective exercise for breast cancer patients,
since it enables the improvement of functional capacities, fatigue, quality
of life and helps to reduce depression. According to the
results shown in the study by Alpozgen et al65, Pilates
also provided improvement in pain, muscle strength, besides being effective
as a rehabilitation exercise for women with breast cancer. Thus,
this method can be considered an alternative treatment for this
public.
