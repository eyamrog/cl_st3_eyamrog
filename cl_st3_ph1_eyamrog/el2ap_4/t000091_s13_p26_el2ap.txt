As benzodiazepines cause some undesirable effects during their therapeutic administration
(Akhondzadeh et al., 2001), conducted a study comparing a Passiflora
incarnata extract (45 mg/day) with oxazepam (30 mg/day) in the
treatment of generalized anxiety. Results demonstrated that the effect of
the passiflora extract had a slower onset, but no decrease
in cognitive functions and work performance during use was observed,
unlike oxazepam.
