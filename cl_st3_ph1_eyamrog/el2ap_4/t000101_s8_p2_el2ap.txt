From a normative perspective, policy change is seen as crucial
to improving social conditions, reducing inequality, and promoting sustainability. The
public policy literature on policy change is extensive and has
provided policy scholars with multiple conceptual frameworks to understand the
mechanics of the policy change process. Alongside that literature, Michael
Bauer and colleagues have addressed a specific kind of policy
change, which they have termed “policy dismantling”. It is defined
as “the cutting, reduction, diminution, or even complete reduction of
existing policies” (Bauer et al., 2012, p. v).
