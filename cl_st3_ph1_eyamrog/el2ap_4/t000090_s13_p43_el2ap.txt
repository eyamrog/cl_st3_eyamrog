After that, the second highest correlation coefficient is between “Research
publications (absolute numbers)” and “Research publications (size-normalized)”, with a value
of 0.6953, just in the limit for a “strong” correlation.
It means that the rankings of total publications and publications
by faculty member are similar, but not the same. I
believe that the publications/faculty member is a better indicator, because
it is not correct to compare those numbers for Institutions
of different sizes, but the results are not so different.
