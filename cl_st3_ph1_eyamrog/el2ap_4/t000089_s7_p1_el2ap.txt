How can religious education (RE) meet the requirements of intercultural
learning in democratic contexts? In this article, I assess different
conceptions and models of RE in Ireland and England, with
a view to construing a normative framework that meets the
requirements of a dialogical rationality. Pointing out the links between
cognitive and experiential knowledge, I reject the liberal view that
religious education should be purely information-oriented. Furthermore, I stress that,
without a transcendental perspective of truth enquiry, egalitarian models of
religious education are not well suited to motivate citizens to
expand their cultural horizons beyond the boundaries of their local
communities. With this in mind, I make the case for
an ethical-dialogical account of religious education, which allows for the
articulation of moral perceptions from each pupilâ€™s experience of the
religious phenomenon, as well as the critical appreciation of religious
and secular truth claims.
