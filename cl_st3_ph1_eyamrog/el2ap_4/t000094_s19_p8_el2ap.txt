After a few pages where the action takes place outside
home, on page 26, the action is again situated at
home. There is no doubt that it is Emily’s bedroom
because there is a clear reference to this in the
written text (“I lay by books upon my bed”), which
is on the left of the page in a centred
position, written on the wall. It is clear that this
action takes place in Emily’s room because a small part
of the bed can be seen as well as a
part of Dad’s legs. Then, on the next page, Emily
appears surrounded by her two fathers in bed. In this
case, it is Daddy who is located on the right,
the place of prominent position. This has to be connected
with the written text, which makes it clear that it
is he who reads: “My Daddy reads in silly voices,
and then I laugh with all my might, until it’s
time to say ‘goodnight.’” The three characters are looking at
the book, which is held by Emily and by Dad.
