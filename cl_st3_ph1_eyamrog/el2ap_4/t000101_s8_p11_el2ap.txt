“a change of direct, indirect, hidden or symbolic nature that
either diminishes the number of policies in a particular area,
reduces the number of policy instruments used and/or lowers their
intensity. It can involve changes to these core elements of
policy and/or it can be achieved by manipulating the capacities
to implement and supervise them3” (Bauer et al., 2012, p.
35).
