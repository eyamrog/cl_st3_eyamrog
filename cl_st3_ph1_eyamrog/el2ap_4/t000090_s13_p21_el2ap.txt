Looking first at the global picture, for the 300 top
European academic institutions performers listed in the 2020 ranking, we
expect 10,800 grades, considering the existence of 36 Indicators. However,
it is noted that we have only 9,258 data available,
which corresponds to 85.72%. We also have 1102 missing data
(10.20%) and 440 data (4.08%) that were considered as “not
applicable”. It means that we have about 15% blank data
for this select group of Academic Institutions, which is not
negligible.
