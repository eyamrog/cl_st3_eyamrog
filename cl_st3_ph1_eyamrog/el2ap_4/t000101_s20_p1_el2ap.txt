Elite Squad is one of the Brazilian movies that made
it to international movie theaters in the late 2000s. It
presents the story of Capitain Nascimento, the leader of an
elite squad in Rio de Janeiro, tasked with combating crime
at any cost. In an infamous line and scene, Nascimento
violently grabs a new recruitee who is not being able
to handle the training and says: “ask me to quit,
ask me to quit” (pede pra sair). The scene portrays
the actor Wagner Moura grabbing the recruitee by his collar,
shouting, and slapping him on the face multiple times. In
Brazil, the scene has become a meme for any situation
in which someone is forced to opt out. In theory,
it is the individual’s choice. In practice, it was coercion
and violence that forced him/her to leave. Violent trainings at
military and police academies are one of the many enduring
legacies of Brazil’s many years of military dictatorship (1964 –
1985).
