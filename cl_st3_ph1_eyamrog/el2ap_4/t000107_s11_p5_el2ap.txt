One of the justifications for the use of bibliometrics is
that it can be employed to cover long periods of
production as well as to identify, spread, and make important
information related to a variety of study areas salient (Ribeiro,
2017). Such characteristics also allow for the (re)designing of fields
of activity, be them the most or the least prominent.
In the case of translation studies, for example, research mapping
contributes to the organization of specialized texts, by giving an
overview of research done on the translation of scientific articles
in the medical field. Mapping is also useful for research
funding agencies as it provides them with data that highlight
the most and the least frequently studied topics. Another contribution
of bibliometric research is the categorization of academic production according
to its researchers, regions, and higher education institutions, which, in
our case, could facilitate the search for researchers interested in
the translation of medical texts.
