The pages where Emily appears with her two fathers show
that Daddy and Dad are situated in different positions: on
the right, page 7, surrounding her, pages 8, 14, and
27, in the centre and on the left, page 19,
and in the background with Daddy on the right joined
with vectors to Emily, page 23 and 28. When she
is represented with Daddy, Emily is on the right on
page 11 and on the left on page 20. Dad
is the first one mentioned on page 6, the first
page there is written text: “This is my Dad, and
my Daddy”, and he appears in the prominent position (on
the right, i.e., the place of new information) the first
time he is in the visual, page 7. He is
also doing the action of drawing, page 8, and cooking,
page 12, i.e., he is more active than Daddy.
