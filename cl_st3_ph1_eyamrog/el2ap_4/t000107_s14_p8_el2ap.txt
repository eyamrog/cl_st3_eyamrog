To further expand the methodology proposed by Alves and Vasconcellos
(2016), we conducted a search using the authors’ names −
which were previously identified on DomínioPúblico, BDTD, and Catálogo de
Teses e Dissertações da CAPES − to check which of
these websites hosted the theses and dissertations included in our
study. This step was important because an additional filter could
reduce the possibility of selecting studies that did not meet
the mapping inclusion criteria. Finally, to investigate the topics covered
by these theses and dissertations, we downloaded the files and
examined the abstracts. The results are shown in section 4.
