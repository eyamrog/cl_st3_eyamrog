In this sense, a general Education about Religions and Beliefs
and Ethics programme can be valid even for denominational schools,
however the NCCA’s proposal of a specific subject, or cross-curricular
area of development, that sets out to present religious contents
“without promoting one faith perspective above another”, raises questions about
its underlying philosophy. Is it meant to promote a neutralist
or postmodern conception of religion that presupposes a common framework
of political principles in the public sphere, while endorsing a
relativistic epistemology in the private realm? Or does it actually
allow for cross- cultural learning to the extent that pupils
are supposed to place themselves in each other’s position? If
the former, then the Catholic Church is right in pointing
out the incompatibility of the project with their own belief
system and educational goals, and the proposal fails to bring
about a dialogical attitude of truth enquiry for the reasons
I have highlighted before. If the latter, it should be
noted that reflectivity can only be fully realised in terms
of substantive criticism, whereby the inconsistences and flaws of one
tradition can be overcome by the acquisition of new conceptual
knowledge, which, after evaluative processes, should lead social groups to
arrive at an unifying ethical system.
