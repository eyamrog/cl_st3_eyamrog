In our previous studies (Bruscato & Baptista, 2022a, 2022b), we
had the participation of only 5 Spanish native speakers (all
learners of Portuguese), and respondents seemed to follow PAS, except
for cases of pronominal cataphora. Now that we have twice
as many participants (not learners of Portuguese), we can see
that the exception was not only in cases of pronominal
cataphora, but also of pronominal anaphora. It seems that, although
Spanish native speakers tend to interpret the ellipsis in subject
position of the subordinate clause as corresponding to the subject
of the main clause more than they do when the
anaphor is a pronoun, they do not tend to interpret
the unstressed pronoun in subject position of the subordinate clause
as corresponding to the complement of the main clause. These
results corroborate the findings of Alonso-Ovalle et al. (2002) and
Keating et al. (2011).
