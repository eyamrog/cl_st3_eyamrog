Studies (INED). Information from the nine other countries in this
group – South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, the Philippines, Hungary,
Mexico, Peru, and Poland – comes from the health authorities'
websites in each of these countries. Finding them often required
the use of search expressions in the native languages of
each country and the translation into English of the headings
of tables and graphs. As in other studies that adopted
similar procedures in the collection of information [PECKHAM et al.
2020: 5], Google Translator was used for this purpose.
