The results obtained are consistent with those reported by different
official sources, such as PMUC, in particular with the number
of ICU beds for COVID-19 patients in the city. It
was also verified that model outputs agree with the number
of deceased people reported for the period of time considered.
It can be concluded that the model can be used
to predict the most likely evolution of the number of
cases and number of beds to be occupied in the
short term.
