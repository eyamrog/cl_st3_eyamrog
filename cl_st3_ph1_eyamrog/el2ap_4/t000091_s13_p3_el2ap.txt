The mechanism of action of medicinal plants that have anxiolytic
properties usually exert effects on GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), the main
inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system (CNS). In addition,
these effects may be on the connection with its receptor,
through direct action on ion channels, on cell membrane modulation,
on the inhibition of GABA transaminase, or on the inhibition
of glutamic acid decarboxylase. The subsequent increase in GABA neurotransmission
has a hindering effect on stimulatory pathways, which ultimately has
a calming effect (Baldwin & Polkinghorn, 2005; Manayi et al.,
2016; Sarris et al., 2018; Farah et al., 2019).
