Despite a legitimate attempt to bring about pluralism in the
curriculum, the research relies on a constructivist perspective to highlight
the fluid character of national identities and the problems associated
with educational policies that aim to inculcate a certain set
of controversial political values. Although the report presents a strong
case for the reformulation of the History Curriculum, in a
manner that takes account of the contribution of minorities to
the country’s development – for instance, the authors cite Peter
Fryer to point out that “whilst Asian and Black African
and Caribbean people played a significant role in fighting both
world wars, this is often not shown in contemporary representations”
(Maylor et al., 2007, p. 55) – it does not
articulate a deliberative framework of moral perceptions for the purpose
of critical thinking. In fact, while assessing current perspectives on
citizenship education – which in Britain is still diffused among
different curriculum areas, including moral and spiritual education – the
report stresses that conceiving public virtues in terms of national
public values is to disregard social struggles for identity-renegotiation. Hence,
instead of the promotion of common values and a shared
conception of citizenship, the curriculum should emphasise “antiracism and the
study of universal human rights”, while allowing for the flourishing
of multicultural identities in the public life (Maylor et al.,
2007, p. 50).
