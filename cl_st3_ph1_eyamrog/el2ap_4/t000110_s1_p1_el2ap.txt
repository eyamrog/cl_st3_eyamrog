(Holocene diatoms from Xingu river: new records for the Brazilian
Amazon and Brazil). Present study is the floristic survey and
the distribution of diatoms observed in two sediment cores of
the Xingu river, Par√° State, north Brazil, and represents the
past ~6,000 cal yr BP. Thirty-eight taxa distributed in twenty
genera were recorded, among which five were new records for
Brazil and nineteen new for the Brazilian Amazon. The most
representative genus based on species number was Gomphonema Ehrenberg with
six species. In brief, present new records represent a 75%
increase in the total number of records for the Brazilian
Amazon, and indicates that this region has not only been
poorly investigated, but also suggests that its biodiversity assessment is
underestimated. These findings highlight the efficacy of the paleolimnological approach
as a tool for assessing biodiversity before the human impacts
begin to affect the pristine conditions of the area.
