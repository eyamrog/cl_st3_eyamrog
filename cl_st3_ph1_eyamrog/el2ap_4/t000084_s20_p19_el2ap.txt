Another point that has contributed to the high frequency of
emojis identified as social presence is that WhatsApp is an
application that allows almost real time replies as users can
answer messages instantly. This feature of WhatsApp may have been
used to signal that the participants were following the course
of interactions, often using short messages with emojis or only
emojis as teachers are always on go. As Pegrum (2014)
claims, the essence of mobile learning happens on demand or
just in time interactions that are usually combined with brevity
and not too much or too little information.
