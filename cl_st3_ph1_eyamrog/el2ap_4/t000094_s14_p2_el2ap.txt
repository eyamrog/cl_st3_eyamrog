Regarding the categories for the analysis, Painter et al. (2013)
refer to the layout, the framing, and the focus as
elements to be explored to deepen in the compositional meaning
of picturebooks. This model is based on Kress & van
Leeuwen (2006), where the authors explore information value, salience and
framing in order to decontruct textual meanings. For this reason,
the analysis will mainly concentrate on the said elements to
shed some light on the narrative of both picturebooks.
