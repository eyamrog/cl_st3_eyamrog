According to the literature, several factors can explain the differences
found in SARS- CoV-2 infection rates between regions and distinct
population groups, such as disparities in the stage of infections,
low testing, and late detection of cases; divergence in the
adoption of control strategies, such as restrictions on the movement
of people, local sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics, and environmental and
meteorological factors, such as humidity and air pollution [4,29].
