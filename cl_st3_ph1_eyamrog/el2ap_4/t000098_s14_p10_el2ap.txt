Information from the other eight countries – Chile, Ecuador, the
USA, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Czech Republic, and Turkey –
of the 28 countries is more heterogeneous, especially concerning the
age groups of the deceased. Each adopts a different criterion
to define age groups. Although this jeopardizes a little the
comparability of results, it does not prevent the calculation of
the adjusted mortality rate, since population data are available with
a disaggregation compatible with any age brackets that can be
defined. Also, except for the USA, whose data were compiled
by the INED, the information was obtained by the same
case-by- case procedure reported in the previous paragraph. Again, sources
were almost always the websites of the national health authorities.
India and Pakistan are exceptions. For Pakistan, the source is
the website of the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE).
For India, one of the main Indian newspapers, Hindustan Times,
cites the Ministry of Health and the Family Welfare5.
