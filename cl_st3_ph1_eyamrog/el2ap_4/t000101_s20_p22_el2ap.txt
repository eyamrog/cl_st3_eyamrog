Also on January 3rd, 2019, Onyx Lorenzoni, who had just
taken office as Minister of the Center of Government (Casa
Civil), tweeted: “We will fire all political appointments working at
Casa Civil. We have to have people who are committed
to what we represent”12. The mass lay-­‐ offs on the
third day of the administration were symptomatic of the assumption
that no one previously working at the federal government might
be possibly committed to ‘what the new administration represented’.
