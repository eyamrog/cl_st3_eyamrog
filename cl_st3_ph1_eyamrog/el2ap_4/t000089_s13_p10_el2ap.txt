As in Ireland, the organisation Humanist UK, formerly the British
Humanist Association, pushes for RE to become “an inclusive, impartial,
objective, fair, balanced and relevant subject allowing pupils to explore
a variety of religions and non-religious worldviews” (Humanist UK, 2017).
Even though the group welcomed the initiative of the Qualifications
and Curriculum Authority to publish a non-statutory National Framework for
Religious Education (NFRE) (2014), their leadership have been raising concerns
about the proper place given to Humanism in the composition
of RE syllabuses, as suggested by that document. In fact,
even though the NFRE recommended the study of Christianity throughout
all key stages, it endorsed a demographic logic for the
appreciation of other religious and secular ethical systems. In this
sense, humanism should become part of the RE syllabus, only
“where appropriate”, while the decision regarding its inclusion should be
at the discretion of each Local Education Authority (LEA). Thus,
against what they refer to as the “NFRE’s deliberately light
touch approach”, the organisation has been seeking parity in the
treatment of Humanism and other religions, which in their view
can only be achieved through the centralisation of the RE
syllabus in accordance with a National Framework (Watson, 2007, p.
2).
