This submodel comprises all the COVID-19 pandemic specific characteristics, such
as important epidemiological effects caused by asymptomatic infectious individuals (A)
or with mild symptoms. The fraction of individuals requiring hospitalization
in intensive care (H) is also considered and it is
assumed that all human agents have the possibility of accessing
a respiratory ventilator, since the local healthcare capacity was not
exceeded in the city under study.
