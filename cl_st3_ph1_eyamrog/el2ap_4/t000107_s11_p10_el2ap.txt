The mapping described in this paper will add to the
mappings being carried out by the University of Brasiliaâ€™s search
group MapTrad. Among such mappings we find the mapping of
game translation/localization (Barcelos & Malta, 2020), didactics of translation, translation
studies for children and adolescents, Spanish <=> Portuguese translation, and
black feminist translated literature.
