A study aimed to determine the effectiveness of passionflower in
reducing anxiety during dental procedure. Sixty-three patients with moderate, high,
and severe anxiety (according to ASA), who required periodontal treatment,
participated in the study. In one group, patients received 20
drops of the passionflower extract the night before and 20
drops the morning after the treatment (at least 90 minutes
before treatment). In another group, placebo was administered in the
same way as the previous group. Finally, a third group
received no drugs. It was observed that administration of passionflower,
as a pre- medication, is significantly effective in reducing anxiety
(Kaviani et al., 2013).
