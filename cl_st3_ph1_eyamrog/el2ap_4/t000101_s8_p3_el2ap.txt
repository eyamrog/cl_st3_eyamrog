The distinction between ordinary policy change and policy dismantling may
not be clear to some. Is policy dismantling simply policy
change that usually comes after a new administration takes office
and sets the course to undo the works of a
predecessor? Is policy dismantling just some kind of undesirable policy
change, therefore breaking with the supposed neutrality of the “theories
of the policy process” (Sabatier & Weible, 2014)?
