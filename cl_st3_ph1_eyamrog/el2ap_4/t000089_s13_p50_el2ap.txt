Regarding non-state schools, in 2014, Ofsted published a report, following
the inspection of some maintained faith schools, in which it
highlighted their importance to the promotion of their denominational ethos
through a specific routine of prayers, celebrations, and holidays. In
Muslim schools, for example, there are usually five prayer-times distributed
throughout the school day, while physical education can be restricted
during Ramadan. In one Hindu school, Sanskrit classes were provided
along with the National Curriculum, and all food provided was
vegetarian (United Kingdom, Ofsted, 2014, sec. 68, 72). Yet, the
document expressed concern about the fact that some Muslim schools
“may well attempt to be creative and try to teach
the skills within the National Curriculum within a variety of
contexts”. In this regard, the report stressed that “inspectors may
need to ask the school how the curriculum is organised
such that the necessary skills and subjects within the National
Curriculum are taught” (United Kingdom, Ofsted, 2014, sec. 33). In
particular, it drew attention to the fact that in those
schools “art and music can be restricted but they are
still required to teach these subjects as part of the
National Curriculum” (United Kingdom: Ofsted, 2014, sec. 42).
