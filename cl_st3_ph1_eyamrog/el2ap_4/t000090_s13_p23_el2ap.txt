The first observation is the existence of two Indicators that
are very weak from this point of view, with less
than 100 (33%) data available: “Strategic research partnerships”, with only
missing data; and “Industry co-patents”, with 91 grades available, 5
missing and 204 “Not Applicable”. Since we have other 34
Indicators that are more complete, those two Indicators will be
removed from the statiscal analyses from now on, to avoid
the influence of large number of unavailable data.
