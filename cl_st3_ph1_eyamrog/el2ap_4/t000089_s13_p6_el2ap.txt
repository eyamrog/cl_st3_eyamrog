The relegation of issues of belief to the private sphere,
combined with an egalitarian conception of education that, drawing on
“shared human values”, precludes differential treatment for majority groups and
minorities, points to a liberal perception that separates objective and
practical knowledge. According to this view, a RE syllabus should
have as its only purpose the examination of the factual
and cognitive dimension of religious phenomena.
