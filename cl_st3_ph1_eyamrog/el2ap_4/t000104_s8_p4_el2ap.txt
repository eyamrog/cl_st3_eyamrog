The growing establishment of protected areas around the world is
often driven by the need to protect habitats and/or species
that are threatened or in critical condition (BORRINI-FEYERABEND et al.,
2017), but the water conservation is often overlooked. However, in
any situation, estimating the carrying capacity of the protected area
is essential for the conservation of the ecosystem in question
(JALLIAN et al., 2012) and, therefore, should be conducted and
monitored.
