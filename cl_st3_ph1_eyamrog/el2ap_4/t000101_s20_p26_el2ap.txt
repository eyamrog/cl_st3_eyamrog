The removal process did not stop in the early months
of the Bolsonaro government. As explained by an interviewee, every
new appointment goes through a ‘background check’ at the presidency,
which is now meant to verify not only if an
individual is a PT supporter, but also if he/she had
a political appointment during any of the previous governments. Interviewees
expressed perceptions of an environment of generalized mistrust and contempt
for civil servants.
