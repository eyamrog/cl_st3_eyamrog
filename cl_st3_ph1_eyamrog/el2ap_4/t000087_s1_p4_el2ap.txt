Conclusion: The results of this study shows that unvaccinated susceptible
adolescents have a higher incidence of COVID-19 than vaccinated adolescents.
But once infected, both unvaccinated and vaccinated adolescents had similar
symptoms including fatigue, runny nose, anosmia, fever, cough, and ageusia.
Adolescents recovered from previous COVID-19 infections were not reinfected. The
lack of infection-mitigating strategies resulted in a superspreading event.
