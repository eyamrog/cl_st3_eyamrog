In this paper, we will test PAS with English and
Spanish learners and native speakers, as well as with Brazilian
(BP) and European (EP) Portuguese native speakers. Many authors (Duarte,
2000; Holmberg et al., 2009; Kempchinsky, 1984) claim that Brazilian
Portuguese, unlike European Portuguese, is one of the “partial null‐subject
languages, that is, languages which allow null subjects but under
more restricted conditions than consistent null‐subject languages” (Holmberg et al.,
2009, p. 1). Thus, ambiguity resolution might differ in these
varieties.
