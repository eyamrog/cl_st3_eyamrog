Water samples were taken to validate parameters such as pH,
dissolved oxygen, conductivity and temperature, using a multimeter probe. Sediment
samples were also collected and stored at 4°C in the
laboratory for further analysis of organic matter (OM) and calcium
carbonate (CaCO3) contents, and grain size distribution. Initially, the sediment
samples were dried at 60 °C for 48 hours (CARMO;
SILVA:, 2012). The quantification of OM was performed using Goldin's
gravimetric method (1987), in which 5g aliquots were distributed in
porcelain crucibles and weighed before and after conditioning in the
muffle for 4 hours at 550 °C. The OM content
was indicated by the loss of mass of the incinerated
waste. The calcium carbonate content was calculated using gravimetry by
hydrochloric acid (HCl) digestion, which reacts with CaCO3, releases a
volume of carbon dioxide and solubilizing the Ca, resulting in
sample weight loss (GROSS, 1971; LORING; RENTALA:, 1992). The grain
size distribution was carried out through the dry-sieving method. Basically,
the 60g of dry sediment were sieved in a set
of meshes (φ scale), and mechanically agitated for 15 minutes;
subsequently, the amount present in each mesh was weighed on
a high precision balance to determine the amounts of each
class of particle size of the sample. The granulometric classification
method was based on the Wentworth (1922, 1933) (mm) and
Krumbein (1934) (Fi) scale.
