Clinical studies have evaluated the efficacy of a kava extract
versus placebo in patients with anxiety symptoms. The results showed
a significant decrease of those symptoms (Witte et al., 2005;
Sarris et al., 2013). In addition, this phytotherapeutic agent shows
satisfactory results regardless of symptoms and type of disorder, including
nonspecific anxiety, tension, agitation, phobias, GAD, and insomnia (Baek et
al., 2014).
