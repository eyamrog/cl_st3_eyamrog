It is interesting that Me, Daddy & Dad starts with
some pieces of paper and pencils on the floor in
a foregrounded position, but none of the characters are represented.
However, they are referred to in the written text and
also in the pictures that appear in the background. The
written text appears on the wall, with the exception of
one line that appears on the carpet; it is highlighted
because it appears right in the centre of the page.
The next page shows all the characters: dad and daddy
appear in the background and Emily, the protagonist of the
book, appears on the left foreground partly covered by Max,
their pup, sitting on a carpet that functions as a
frame. The three characters are wearing casual clothes: jeans, t-shirts,
and shirts. Dad has dark hair, and Daddy is blonde,
like Emily.
