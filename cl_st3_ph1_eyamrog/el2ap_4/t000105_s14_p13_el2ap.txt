The videos that explained the theme of the project were
also disseminated to community health agents who were responsible for
guiding the coordinators in the census sectors of the areas
of greatest social vulnerability, which were randomly selected in the
first stage of the survey in both cities. All the
videos were created in a language accessible to the target
audience and addressed the role of each professional in the
data collection team.
