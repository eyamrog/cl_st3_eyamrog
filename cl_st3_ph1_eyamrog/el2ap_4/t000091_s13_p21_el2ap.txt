Currently, one study assessed the effects of a single dose
of Valerian (1600 mg) on sedation through the standardized field
sobriety test and performance parameters of a driving simulator. The
authors verified that the acute intake of the phytotherapeutic agents
did not affect performance of the participants in the driving
simulator (Thomas et al., 2016).
