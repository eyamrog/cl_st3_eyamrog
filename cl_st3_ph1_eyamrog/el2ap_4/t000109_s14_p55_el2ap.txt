To validate the model, the initial conditions and parameters related
to host transmission in the city of Hoyo de Manzanares
were applied9 [47]. In this case, following the methodology presented
by other epidemiological models based on agents [13][48], it was
verified that AbCSim outputs agree with data collected on field,
and that the model output dispersion, measured in terms of
the interquartile range, is acceptable.
