Statistical analysis comparing presence values between Events and the different
Series identified temporal patterns of change as a function of
both Event and Series for Factors III (Hope) and XI
(Receptivity). Specifically, a significant interaction was observed between Event and
Series, indicating that the presence values of the PMSL Factors
varied according to both the type of Event and the
Series to which they belonged (Figure 3). For Factor III
(Hope), presence values in the TR-PRE phase of Series 1
were significantly higher than those in Series 2 (p=0.001) and
Series 3 (p=0.000), and TR-PRE values in Series 2 were
higher than those in Series 3 (p=0.001), demonstrating a progressive
decline of Factor III (Hope) across the Series. Additionally, Factor
III (Hope) presence values in Series 1 MATCH were higher
than those in Series 2 (p=0.001) and Series 3 MATCHES
(p=0.039), confirming the same declining trend throughout the competition Series.
Factor XI (Receptivity) exhibited a similar pattern, with TR-PRE presence
values in Series 1 exceeding those in Series 2 (p=0.001)
and Series 3 (p=0.000), and higher presence values in Series
1 MATCHES compared to Series 2 (p=0.005), as well as
in Series 2 MATCHES compared to Series 3 (p=0.028). In
contrast, Factor VII (Interest) demonstrated statistically significant differences based on
Event and Series independently, but no significant interaction between these
variables was detected.
