In examining the relationships between representatives and local actors, scholars
frequently investigate the extent to which party affiliations influence the
formation of alliances. Specifically, the focus is on whether alliances
predominantly occur among co-partisans or involve any form of party
coordination, thereby positioning brokers as agents of the party and
resulting in electoral support for the party’s candidates. Empirical evidence
from Brazil indicates the presence of partisan brokerage, as documented
by Baião and Couto (2017), Avelino, Biderman, and Barone (2012),
Barone (2014), Bezerra (1999), and Meireles (2019).
