The modal structure of the Oral-B advertisementâ€™s conversational modes, as
presented in the Total (vertical) aspect of Table 3, demonstrates
the presence of both mood and residue units. The residue,
however, receives a higher score than the mood, with 15
points specifically attributed to the complement. This distribution supports the
view that the residue of a clause functions as the
rhematic component, which contains the core information of the message
(Halliday & Matthiessen, 2014; Dalamu, 2018a).
