These plants range in size from a few centimeters to
up to 10 meters in height. Key characteristics of this
group include a rhizomatous stem that typically stores starch, the
presence of a pseudostem (with a true stem being rare),
and parallel-pinnate leaf venation. Their inflorescences are either terminal or
basal and are generally surrounded by colored bracts. The flowers
are usually complete and bisexual, with the exception of Musaceae,
which presents unisexual flowers. The group exhibits 1 to 6
fertile stamens and 1 to 5 sterile stamens (staminodes) that
may resemble petals. The ovary is inferior and trilocular, with
each locule containing one or more ovules. The fruits can
be either fleshy or dry, and the seeds are generally
provided with an aril (Costa et al., 2011).
