An HP 2000® laptop and an MTN® Internet modem were
used to facilitate the download of a video from YouTube
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F69YVBvF58) by employing Savefrom.net to convert the video into an
accessible format. It should be noted that this advertisement is
not the only Oral-B advertisement available on YouTube. This particular
advertisement is characterized by the depiction of social actors who
consistently display smiles and demonstrate an awareness of time throughout
the video.
