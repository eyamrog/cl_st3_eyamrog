Randomized clinical trials have reported positive outcomes for several topical
therapies in the management of malignant fungating wounds (MFWs). Analgesic
agents with demonstrated efficacy include lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5% and morphine gel
0.2%. Antimicrobial agents with positive results include metronidazole 0.8% solution,
polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) with betaine 0.1% solution, octenidine solution, honey,
and silver. In addition, the combined use of topical therapies
on the wound bed and periwound skin, along with the
implementation of dressing change techniques designed to prevent pain, may
further improve pain management in individuals with MFWs (Figure 3).
