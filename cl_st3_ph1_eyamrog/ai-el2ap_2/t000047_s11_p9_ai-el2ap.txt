Gestural activities have played a significant role in meaning-making within
the Oral-B Toothpaste communication by visually reinforcing verbal messages and
enhancing the clarity of the intended information. Through deliberate hand
movements, facial expressions, and body language, presenters are able to
emphasize key product features, demonstrate proper usage techniques, and convey
positive emotional responses associated with the product. These nonverbal cues
facilitate audience understanding by providing additional context and aiding in
the retention of information, thereby supporting the overall effectiveness of
the communication strategy.
