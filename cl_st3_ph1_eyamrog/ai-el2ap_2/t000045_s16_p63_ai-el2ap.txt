Our analysis was not limited to the electoral period; consistent
with previous research (Auyero, 2000; Zarazaga, 2014; Hoyler, Gelape, and
Silotto, 2021), we emphasize the significance of non-electoral activities undertaken
by brokers. These activities include executing public works, implementing public
policies, conveying local demands to state authorities, and addressing both
individual and collective issues faced by voters. Thus, brokers contribute
to a range of political outcomes beyond the generation of
votes.
