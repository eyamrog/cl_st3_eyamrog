Social Actor 2 establishes a sense of belonging for Social
Actor 1 by providing and having him wear a white
lab coat, thereby creating an indexical relationship between the two
individuals (Dyer, 2005). The act of donating and wearing the
lab coat suggests that only dental professionals are qualified to
promote Oral-B in a manner consistent with the brand’s marketing
objectives. Social Actor 2 implicitly communicates to Social Actor 1
that laypersons are not suitable representatives for advertising Oral-B, and
that only reputable dentists affiliated with the Oral-B Institute possess
the authority to inform the target audience about the product’s
qualities.
