The impact of COVID-19 in Brazil and India must be
analyzed in relation to two historically entrenched factors that predate
their current authoritarian governments: racism and discrimination. In Brazil, Black,
mixed-race, and indigenous Amazonian populations—who collectively constitute more than half
of the national population—experienced disproportionately adverse outcomes during the pandemic.
Similarly, in India, despite the 1950 Constitution’s prohibition of discrimination
based on religion and caste, the Muslim minority, Dalits (historically
marginalized groups formerly referred to as "untouchables" and often engaged
in menial labor), and inter-state migrant workers were subject to
social segregation and were disproportionately affected by the nationwide lockdown.
The initial wave of COVID-19 in both countries aligns with
one of the three phases described in Charles Rosenberg’s "epidemic
drama" model. According to this framework, communities attempt to rationalize
pandemics in ways that offer a sense of control, which
may include minimizing their own vulnerability and responsibility, and attributing
blame for the spread of disease to minority groups.
