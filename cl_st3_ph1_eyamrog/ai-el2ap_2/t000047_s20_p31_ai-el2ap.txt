Based on the data presented in Table 2, the Oral-B
video incorporates four HLMA segments. This segmentation informs the distribution
of HLMA frequencies, as shown in Table 3. Figure 11
demonstrates that HLMA 1 contains the highest number of grammatical
components, with 21 instances, surpassing all other segments. Both HLMA
4 and HLMA 2 utilize 10 components each to engage
the target audience and promote product consumption, while HLMA 3
contains only six linguistic components. These findings suggest that the
advertising strategy involves a greater use of verbal elements in
the introductory and concluding segments of the video. In contrast,
HLMA 2 and HLMA 3 rely more heavily on visual
and auditory elements, such as images, colors, and sounds, rather
than spoken language.
