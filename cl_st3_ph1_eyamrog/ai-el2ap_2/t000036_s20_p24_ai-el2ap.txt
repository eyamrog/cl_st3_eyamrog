The Law on the Work of Women and Children, and
Protection of Maternity, strictly prohibited the employment of minors under
14 years of age. Employers were required to ensure that
workers under 18 years of age received formal primary education.
For workers under 18, the maximum allowable working time was
limited to eight hours per week. Regarding female workers, employment
during night shifts was prohibited, and employers were mandated to
provide a subsidy for a total of six weeks, comprising
three weeks before and three weeks after childbirth.
