The coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic represents one of the most significant
global health challenges of the 21st century. By 2022, two
years after the initial outbreak in China in late 2019,
COVID-19 had resulted in more than 62 million deaths worldwide.
The unpredictable trajectory of the pandemic has contributed to sustained
levels of stress, fear, and psychological distress among populations (Danese
et al., 2020). Previous studies have documented a broad spectrum
of psychosocial impacts at the individual level during infectious disease
outbreaks (Abad et al., 2020). Common psychological responses include fear
of illness or death, feelings of helplessness, and experiences of
stigma (Wang et al., 2020).
