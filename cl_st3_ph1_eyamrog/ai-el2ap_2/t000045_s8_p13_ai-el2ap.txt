Ames, Baker, and Renn√≥ (2008) provide evidence that voters frequently
select candidates for the national legislature based on local concerns,
favoring those who are perceived as effective in securing resources
for their constituencies. Ames (1994) refers to the electoral outcomes
resulting from this reciprocal support as "reverse coattails effects."
