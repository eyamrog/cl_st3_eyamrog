A Regierungserklärung, translated here as ‘policy statement’, is typically delivered
by the chancellor at the beginning of their term as
an inaugural address. However, according to German law, chancellors may
present a Regierungserklärung at any point during their mandate, and
such statements are generally followed by a parliamentary debate (Korte,
2002, pp. 452–453; Stüwe, 2005, p. 21). The term is
composed of Regierung (‘government’) and Erklärung, which denotes both ‘explanation’
and ‘declaration’. Consequently, the concept is inherently ambiguous, as it
encompasses both an interpretive and justificatory account of government policy
in relation to the current context, as well as an
official declaration or directive clarification regarding a specific situation (Pörksen,
2003, p. 40).
