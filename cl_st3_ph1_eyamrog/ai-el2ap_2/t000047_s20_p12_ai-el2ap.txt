The advertisement presents evidence supporting the claimed 2-IN-1 superiority of
Oral-B in HLMA 3. The LLMA sequence begins at O-BT24
and concludes at O-BT27. In these segments, the progression of
time is emphasized, as indicated by timestamps displayed at 7:00,
7:43, 13:00, and 19:00. The narrative provides a chronological account
of product usage, suggesting that the individual identified as Social
Actor 3 brushed her teeth with Oral-B at 7:00 in
the morning and left for work at 7:43, purportedly with
fresh breath. This sequence aligns with the initial directive, "You
clean your teeth every morning." At 13:00, while at the
office, the advertisement asserts that the fresh breath persisted. Furthermore,
at 19:00, upon returning home from work, the advertisement claims
that Oral-B continued to maintain fresh breath, thereby reinforcing the
productâ€™s long-lasting effectiveness as promoted.
