The mandibular canal (MC), situated within the mandible, contains the
inferior alveolar nerve and inferior alveolar vessels. This neurovascular bundle
is susceptible to injury during mandibular surgical procedures. Consequently, thorough
preoperative evaluation of the MC is essential to minimize the
risk of intraoperative damage and reduce the incidence of postoperative
complications.
