During 2020 and 2021, the Virtual Laboratory of Affective, Cognitive,
and Behavioral Neuropsychometry (LAVINACC) conducted a study entitled "Physical and
Psychological Reactions as Health Indicators throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic." Among
various indicators, the study investigated peri-traumatic stress during the COVID-19
pandemic in Brazil by administering the Peri-Traumatic Distress Scale (CPDI)
(Qiu et al., 2020) to a sample of 1,844 participants
(Abad et al., 2020).
