Regarding the category of “Self-care,” we observed a notable emphasis
on the individual's role in establishing boundaries and strategies for
maintaining health. In line with Bracht (2019), self-care can be
understood as comprising two distinct dimensions: the first occurs when
self-care practices are influenced by external pressures or oppression, leading
the individual to engage in these behaviors due to coercion;
the second dimension arises when self-care is undertaken consciously and
autonomously, reflecting the exercise of personal freedom, wherein the body
is regarded as an active participant in the development of
a chosen lifestyle.
