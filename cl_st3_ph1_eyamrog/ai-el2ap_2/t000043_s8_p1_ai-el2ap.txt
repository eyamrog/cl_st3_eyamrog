The Self-controlled Case Series (SCCS) method is an observational epidemiological
study design used to investigate the temporal association between a
time-varying exposure and the occurrence of acute events. In this
design, individuals who have experienced the event of interest serve
as their own controls, allowing for within-person comparisons over different
time periods (1â€“5).
