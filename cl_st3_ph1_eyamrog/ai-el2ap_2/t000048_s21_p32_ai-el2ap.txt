Maas (1977) noted that R. petasites is a relatively variable
species, exhibiting considerable differences in inflorescence size depending on the
collection site. This variation is evident when comparing specimens from
the present study area with those from other locations. In
the study area, the specimens displayed scapes ranging from 8.5
to 37.4 cm in length and inflorescences measuring 3 to
7.2 cm in length, which are notably smaller than those
reported from other regions, where scapes can reach up to
50 cm and inflorescences up to 30 cm in length
(e.g., H. Mos√©n 2966, Reitz & Klein 4027, and L.A.
Mattos Silva 3673).
