Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, leading German politicians have
consistently described the situation as a “Zeitenwende” (a turning point),
a “watershed,” a “new era,” and a “new reality.” In
his policy statement on 27 February 2022, German Chancellor Olaf
Scholz stated, “With his attack on Ukraine on Thursday, President
Putin has created a new reality.” Similarly, German Foreign Minister
Annalena Baerbock, in her speech at the United Nations, asserted,
“Russia’s war marks the dawn of a new era. It’s
a watershed moment. Yesterday’s certainties are gone. Today, we face
a new reality that none of us chose. It is
a reality that President Putin has forced upon us.” Notably,
the term “truce” was absent from these speeches. Rather than
calling for de-escalation and dialogue, Scholz announced an armament plan
that would position Germany as the world’s third largest defence
spender. Although Germany has not historically been as pacifist as
some national narratives suggest (Dalgaard-Nielsen, 2005; Rathbun, 2006), Scholz’s decision
nonetheless represents a significant shift in German military policy.
