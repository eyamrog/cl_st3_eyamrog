Twenty-two patients were initially selected for phase I of the
project; however, one patient did not attend the denture fabrication
appointment, two patients were rehabilitated with partial dentures, and one
patient did not attend the one-year reevaluation, reporting non-use of
the dentures due to the expectation of receiving implants. Consequently,
in accordance with the exclusion criteria, nineteen participants were included
in phase I of the study (four rehabilitated with maxillary
dentures and fifteen with both maxillary and mandibular dentures), and
eighteen participants were included in phase IV.
