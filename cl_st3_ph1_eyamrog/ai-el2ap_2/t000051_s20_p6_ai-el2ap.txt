The discourse also includes references to personal war experiences, as
evidenced by mentions of “Erzählungen unserer Eltern und Großeltern […]
vom Krieg” (‘our parents’ or grandparents’ tales of war’), which
evoke memories of World War II and frame the current
situation as unprecedented in Europe since that time, utilizing affective
expressions such as “Entsetzen” (‘horror’) and “für die Jüngeren ist
es kaum fassbar: Krieg in Europa” (‘for younger people it
is almost inconceivable: war in Europe’). This thematic assertion is
reiterated when Scholz claims that Putin is dismantling the European
security order that has existed for nearly half a century
since the Helsinki Final Act. Although the war in Ukraine
may represent the first large-scale invasion by land, air, and
sea in Europe since World War II, the implication that
Europe has not experienced war or violent changes to borders
in the intervening period is inaccurate and overlooks the contentious
involvement of NATO and Germany in the Yugoslav wars.
