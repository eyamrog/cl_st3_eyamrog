Advisors refer to their activities involving municipalities and local leaders
as “political affairs” (“trabalho político”), distinguishing these tasks from other
responsibilities. All interviewees provided estimates of the number of allied
municipalities, and nearly all presented spreadsheets listing the municipalities associated
with the legislator. Although the format of these spreadsheets varied,
they generally included the names of the municipalities, the number
of votes received by the state legislator in the most
recent election, and the name of the primary broker, who
could be the current mayor, a councilor, a former mayor,
a former councilor, or, less frequently, a community leader.
