The nitrate industry was among the sectors that received differentiated
wage regulations. On January 8, 1934, the minimum daily wages
for this industry were established as follows: single workers received
10 pesos per day; married workers or those identified as
heads of family received 15 pesos per day; and workers
who were older adults, had a disability, or were minors
received a wage equivalent to 50% of the salary designated
for single workers.
