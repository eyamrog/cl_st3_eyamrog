Due to the lack of official data, this study adopts
an initial estimate and extrapolates it to the 1930s. In
1930, approximately 14% of the population resided in urban centers
with more than 20,000 inhabitants (Bethell 1998: 31). Based on
these figures, it is estimated that approximately 116,480 individuals were
employed in the urban economy, while about 715,520 were engaged
in the rural economy. According to De la Torre (1993),
in 1936, 55% of Quitoâ€™s population was marginally employed, with
10.4% working as day laborers, 23.5% as independent workers, and
21.1% as domestic workers. Public sector employment accounted for 16.6%
of the workforce in 1936 (Naranjo, 2017).
