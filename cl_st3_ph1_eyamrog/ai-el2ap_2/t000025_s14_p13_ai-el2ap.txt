Following the searches, all identified records were consolidated and managed
using Mendeleyâ“‡ (Mendeley Ltd., Elsevier, The Netherlands), which was also
used for duplicate removal. Two independent reviewers screened the titles
and abstracts of the records according to predefined inclusion criteria.
Full texts of potentially relevant documents were then retrieved and
assessed in detail by the same two independent reviewers, again
using the inclusion criteria. Any disagreements between the reviewers at
any stage of the selection process were resolved by consultation
with a third reviewer.
