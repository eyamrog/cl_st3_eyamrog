The initial consultation, conducted approximately 45 days prior to the
commencement of the campaign, was designed to identify indigenous individuals
in need of dentures. During this phase, the village health
team dentist performed anamnesis and clinical examinations to select candidates
for dental rehabilitation. A semi-structured interview was administered to assess
issues related to edentulism and to document patient expectations regarding
denture use. All participants completed a socio-clinical-demographic questionnaire and underwent
a baseline quality of life assessment using the OHIP-14 instrument,
which evaluates seven dimensions—functional limitation, physical pain, psychological discomfort, physical
disability, psychological disability, social disability, and handicap—across 14 items. Each
item was rated on a five-point scale: Never = 0,
Almost never = 1, Occasionally = 2, Almost always =
3, and Always = 4.
