The Self-controlled Risk Interval (SCRI) design is a variant of
the Self-Controlled Case Series (SCCS) method in which each case
serves as its own control. This design defines a risk
period and a control interval, with the control interval positioned
either before or after the exposure. In the SCRI approach,
the control interval is intentionally reduced; for example, in vaccine
studies, a short period immediately before or after vaccination and
close to the risk period is selected as the control
interval. This reduction aims to minimize time-related confounding factors such
as age and seasonality. Typically, the duration of the control
interval is matched to that of the risk period. For
instance, in a study assessing adverse events following varicella vaccination
in Taiwan, the risk interval was defined as days 1
to 42 post-vaccination, while the control interval comprised days 43
to 84 post-vaccination.
