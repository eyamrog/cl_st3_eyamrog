The second pillar involves the implementation of a simplified technique
in which the fabrication and delivery of dentures are completed
within a single day. In the morning, patients undergo anatomical
and functional impression taking, intermaxillary registration, and the assembly and
trial of the dental arches. In the afternoon, laboratory procedures
are performed, including muffle inclusion, polymerization of thermally activated acrylic
resin using a microwave, and subsequent finishing and polishing. As
a result, patients receive their complete conventional dentures by the
end of the same day.
