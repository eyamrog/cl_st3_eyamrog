Among the Heliconia species found in the State of São
Paulo, H. farinosa is morphologically similar to H. subulata Ruiz
& Pav., but can be distinguished by its exclusively elliptical
leaf blades, the presence of foliate basal bracts that may
be either fertile or sterile, and oval-lanceolate bracteoles, whereas H.
subulata exhibits elliptical or oblong blades, fertile basal bracts, and
elliptical bracteoles (Braga 2020). Additionally, H. farinosa can be distinguished
from other Zingiberales present in the Núcleo Curucutu by its
characteristic boat-shaped bracts and predominantly lacerated leaves.
