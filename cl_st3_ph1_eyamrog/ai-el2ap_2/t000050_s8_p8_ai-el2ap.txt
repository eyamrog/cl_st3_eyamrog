The transmission of American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) south of the
Amazon River system remains inadequately characterized [8,9]. While it has
frequently been reported that human Leishmania infection is either rare
or absent south of the Negro and Amazon Rivers [8,10],
available data indicate that the incidence of leishmaniasis in some
southern areas is comparable to that observed north of these
rivers [9,11]. Guerra et al. (2011) [12] investigated the epidemiology
of mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) south of the Amazon River and
identified not only a high prevalence of ML but also
a distribution of Leishmania species similar to that found north
of the river. Nevertheless, the etiologic agent responsible for cutaneous
leishmaniasis (CL) in these southern regions has not been determined,
and both the sylvatic reservoir and the vectors involved in
transmission remain unidentified south of the Amazon River system [8,13].
