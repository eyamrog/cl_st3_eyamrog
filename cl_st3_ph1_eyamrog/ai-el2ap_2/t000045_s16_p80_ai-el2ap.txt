In addition to challenges in evaluating broker performance, actors are
not always able to achieve the outcomes anticipated by their
allies. According to the interviewees, local brokers frequently underperform due
to factors outside their control, including shifts in local political
alliances, party decisions that limit available options, and changes in
power resulting from state and municipal elections. Consequently, respondents appear
more likely to recognize the positive contributions of local allies
rather than attribute poor outcomes to their actions. This suggests
that, contrary to some theoretical assumptions, principals are not always
able to effectively sanction or credibly threaten brokers to ensure
compliance.
