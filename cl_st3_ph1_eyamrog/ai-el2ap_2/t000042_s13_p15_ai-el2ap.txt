By mid-October 2020, similar to the situation in Manaus in
late 2020, Indian officials speculated that urban areas in India
were nearing herd immunity and anticipated a subsequent decline in
COVID-19 cases. Although the number of new cases had decreased
by the first half of February 2021, transmission was not
fully controlled, and a second wave was imminent. Concurrently, the
national immunization campaign was launched under the assumption that herd
immunity had already been achieved, with the belief that over
70% of the population had acquired some level of immunity
through prior infection, thereby reducing the perceived need for widespread
vaccination in this group. On January 3, 2021, two vaccines
received approval: Covaxin, developed by Bharat Biotech, and Covishield, produced
by the Serum Institute of India in collaboration with AstraZeneca
and Oxford University. The national vaccination program faced several ethical,
legal, and transparency challenges, which contributed to vaccine hesitancy and
public criticism. For instance, Covaxin was approved based solely on
Phase I clinical trial data. The vaccination rate increased slowly,
hindered by competition among state governments and private hospitals for
limited resources such as vaccines, ventilators, oxygen cylinders, and hospital
beds. Additionally, the abrupt policy shift from prioritizing individuals over
50 years of age to including all adults over 18,
implemented without prior consultation with state authorities, further complicated the
rollout. Between January and mid-May 2021, only 13% of the
population had been vaccinated, while most non-pharmacological interventions were discontinued.
