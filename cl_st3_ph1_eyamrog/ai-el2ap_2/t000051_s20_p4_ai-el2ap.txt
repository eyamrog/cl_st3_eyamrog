This analysis diverts attention from the involvement of contemporary major
powers in the Ukraine war and reduces the conflict to
a solely historically revisionist act. It further suggests that powerful
states do not routinely violate international law, a claim that
appears inconsistent with the documented history of recent NATO operations
worldwide and the war in Yugoslavia in Europe (Gray, 2018;
D. Johnstone, 2022). Although Scholz asserts that the invasion of
Ukraine signifies the beginning of a new era, the armament
policies introduced in response are purportedly intended to prevent such
a transformation and to maintain the existing international order. Consequently,
the precise nature of this "new era" remains ambiguous. It
is unclear whether Scholz refers to "warmongers like Putin" because
he anticipates the emergence of similar actors in the future.
If the stated objective is to uphold the current European
security order and international law, rather than revert to a
period characterized by military aggression and conflict, the rationale behind
Scholz and other German politicians' strong advocacy for increased defense
spending as indicative of a new era warrants further clarification.
