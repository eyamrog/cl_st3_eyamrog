Regarding budget amendments, legislators’ offices typically maintain spreadsheets that catalog
all requests, specifying the type of expenditure (such as public
works, equipment, or vehicle purchases), the requested amount, the municipality
involved, and the intermediary who facilitated and submitted the request.
Prior to the official allocation of an amendment to a
specific locality, the office generally contacts the requesters to communicate
the feasible options. Given that it is often not possible
to accommodate all requests, mayors and councilors must determine their
priorities. According to most interviewees, particularly those who characterize the
legislator as a “municipalist,” budget amendments represent the resources most
highly valued by mayors.
