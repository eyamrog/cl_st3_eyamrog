The Wajãpi are organized into autonomous local groups known as
"iwanã-ko," each originating from a specific region that contains several
villages. However, not all members of an "iwanã-ko" reside in
the same region, as intergroup marriages often result in one
spouse relocating to the other's region, which may be a
temporary arrangement. The Wajãpi utilize three spatial categories: areas of
concentration (rural villages and dwellings), intermittent dispersal sites (primarily used
during the dry season for hunting, fishing, and gathering), and
"koo kwerã" sites, which are designated wildlife reserves left undisturbed
to support animal populations for future hunting. The interplay of
social, political, and ecological factors influencing the Wajãpi's patterns of
settlement and mobility appears to correspond with the distribution of
diseases within the Wajãpi Indigenous Territory (TIW). Specifically, the trend
of families concentrating near the Perimetral Norte highway, which provides
access to the TIW, is associated with a higher incidence
of infectious diseases [16,21].
