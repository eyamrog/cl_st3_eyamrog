According to Silva, Silva, and Lüdorf (2015), body valorization in
contemporary society is primarily associated with concerns about health and
aesthetics, and is significantly influenced by media exposure. In this
context, the statements made by teacher Larissa suggest that the
interplay of these factors can contribute to risky behaviors. Silva
et al. (2017) further argue that media influence affects individuals’
habits and social relationships, which can have both positive and
negative impacts on young people. Consequently, there is evidence of
an expanded conception of health that shapes individual behaviors, which
may, in some cases, result in actions that increase the
risk of health problems.
