We reviewed 70 studies investigating 20 topical therapies, including dressings
with various mechanisms of action, analgesic drugs, and antimicrobial agents,
which reported promising results in pain mitigation. However, only 31.4%
of these studies utilized standardized pain assessment tools, such as
the Visual Analogue Scale, Numerical Verbal Scale, McGill Pain Questionnaire,
or categorical assessments (no pain, mild, moderate, severe). Additionally, a
survey assessing attitudes and knowledge regarding pain assessment and management
among healthcare providers found that nurses demonstrated a lower level
of knowledge in this area (Nuseir et al., 2016).
