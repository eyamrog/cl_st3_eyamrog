The role of gestures in teacher-student interactions during teaching and
learning processes warrants examination, particularly regarding their function as a
significant communication channel in classroom settings. This literature review addresses
key questions: the ways in which gestures can facilitate teaching,
the extent to which gestures contribute to educational outcomes, and
the current state of research on gesture analysis within educational
contexts. To address these issues, a comprehensive review of the
relevant literature was conducted, focusing on empirical studies and theoretical
frameworks that explore the impact of non-verbal communication, specifically gestures,
on teaching and learning. The central research question guiding this
review is: What is the contribution of gestures (non-verbal communication)
to the teaching and learning process?
