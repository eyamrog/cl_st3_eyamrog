Linguistic and communication studies employ various methods for realizing meaning,
a principle that underpins the concept of multimodality, which bases
meaning-making on the selection and construction of modes. Page (2010)
defines a mode as a means of interpreting the material
world, characterized by its capacity to generate meaning potentials. These
capacities can vary, often depending on factors such as the
audience's background, the intended type of meaning, and the subject
matter represented by the modes (Herman, 2010). Consequently, modes can
be considered fluid and open-ended entities. Since a mode is
realized through a medium, it can convey different meanings depending
on the specific media context. This dependency suggests that modes
are contingent on their situational context for meaning determination.
