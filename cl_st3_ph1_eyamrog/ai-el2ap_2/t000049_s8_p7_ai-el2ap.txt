This research was conducted on an exploratory basis with the
objective of identifying and analyzing the most effective contexts—specifically in
terms of space, time, and educational approaches—for fostering the development
of scientific thinking in kindergarten children. The initial project design,
overseen by a team of researchers and supervisors, was subject
to minor adjustments in response to observations of the children
and the ongoing review of collected documentation. The final analysis
focuses on the children's progress in scientific understanding, which is
found to be closely linked to the specific contexts in
which the activities were implemented. These contexts—including the selection of
tools, allocation of time, and educational strategies—were deliberately chosen by
adults and were systematically documented, monitored, and evaluated from multiple
perspectives to optimize the experience for children, teachers, and families.
