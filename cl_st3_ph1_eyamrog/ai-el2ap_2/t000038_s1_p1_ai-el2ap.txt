An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to empirically determine
the factor structure of the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI)
using data from the Physical and Psychological Reactions as Health
Indicators Research (Virtual Laboratory of Affective, Cognitive and Behavioral Neuropsychometry
– LAVINACC), which assessed peri-traumatic stress during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The EFA was performed using a polychoric correlation matrix and
the Robust Diagonally Weighted Least Squares (RDWLS) extraction method. Parallel
analysis with random permutation was employed to determine the number
of factors, and Robust Promin was used as the rotation
technique. Model adequacy was evaluated using the Root Mean Square
Error of Approximation (RMSEA), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), and Comparative Fit
Index (CFI). The Ratio Communality Index (RCI = 0.998452) indicated
that both subsamples shared a similar amount of common variance.
The polychoric correlation matrix demonstrated adequacy, as evidenced by Bartlett's
test of sphericity (χ² = 21116.6, df = 276, p
< 0.00001) and a Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) value of 0.939. Additional
indices, including UniCo (0.918), ECV (0.85), and MIREAL (0.200), supported
the suitability of a two-factor structure for the CPDI, with
the first factor representing internal stressors and the second factor
representing external stressors. Further replication studies are recommended to confirm
the validity and reliability of these findings.
