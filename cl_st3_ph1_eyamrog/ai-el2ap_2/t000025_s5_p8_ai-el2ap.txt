Topical opioids represent an additional therapeutic option. Opioid receptors are
located in the peripheral nervous system, where they are synthesized
in the dorsal root ganglia and transported axonally to peripheral
terminals; these receptors become detectable following peripheral injury and inflammation.
The presence of an inflammatory process in malignant fungating wound
(MFW) beds may account for the observed analgesic effects of
topical opioids (Vardhan et al., 2019). Future research should investigate
the efficacy of more potent opioids, such as fentanyl, in
this context (Wang et al., 2017).
