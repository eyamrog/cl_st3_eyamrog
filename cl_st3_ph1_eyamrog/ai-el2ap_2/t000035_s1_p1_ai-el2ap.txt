The rehabilitation of edentulous Indigenous individuals residing in villages with
dental prostheses has posed significant challenges for institutions responsible for
Indigenous health care, primarily due to logistical difficulties associated with
transporting patients to urban centers. This retrospective observational study involved
nineteen edentulous Indigenous participants who were rehabilitated using the simplified
"Prosthesis in One Day" technique. Prior to prosthesis fabrication (t0),
participants underwent a clinical examination and an interview during which
the Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14) was administered. Prosthesis adjustments
were performed as needed. After one year (t1), a follow-up
interview was conducted, which included the OHIP-14 and additional questionnaires
assessing patient perceptions of prosthesis quality, comfort, and chewing ability.
Results demonstrated a significant reduction in the oral health impact
on quality of life across all OHIP-14 domains (median t0
= 33.0; median t1 = 0.0; effect size = 4.69).
Overall, patient-reported scores for both upper and lower dentures were
high after one year of use, and there was a
reported improvement in chewing ability. The "Prosthesis in One Day"
technique appears to be an effective alternative for the rehabilitation
of Indigenous villagers, with a positive impact on their quality
of life.
