Both survey waves indicate that one of the most frequently
reported activities is interacting with government agencies to fulfill requests
from mayors within their region. Among respondents who identified mayors
or councilors as one of their two primary sources of
support, 71.7% in the 2007 survey reported engaging in this
activity regularly. This proportion increased to 73.3% among respondents in
the 2012 survey.
