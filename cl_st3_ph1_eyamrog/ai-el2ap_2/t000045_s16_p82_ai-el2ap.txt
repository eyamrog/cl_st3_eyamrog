Our empirical findings and their interpretation are grounded in an
analysis of the institutional design established in Brazil in 1988,
which allocates power, resources, and authority both horizontally and vertically
among the branches of government and the entities of the
federation. Existing literature has documented that Brazilian institutions generate a
complex system of overlapping responsibilities, characterized by various asymmetries, a
combination of autonomy and dependency, and concurrent incentives for both
cooperation and competition. This institutional arrangement influences the career incentives
of politicians, who often do not pursue national-level positions (Samuels,
2003; Santos; Pegurier, 2011), and shapes the ways in which
politicians at different governmental levels interact, coordinate, and collaborate to
address policy challenges, implement programs, and achieve electoral objectives. These
relationships cannot be accurately described as purely horizontal, nor can
they be characterized as strictly hierarchical.
