The quality assessment tool used in this study is an
adaptation of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (19) for evaluating the quality
of cohort studies, as presented by Wachira et al., and
incorporates the fundamental assumptions of the Self-Controlled Case Series (SCCS)
and Self-Controlled Risk Interval (SCRI) methods (21). The adaptation was
developed by V.W. and subsequently evaluated by H.M. and M.R.
Additionally, the tool has been utilized by two other researchers
in their respective systematic review studies (22, 23).
