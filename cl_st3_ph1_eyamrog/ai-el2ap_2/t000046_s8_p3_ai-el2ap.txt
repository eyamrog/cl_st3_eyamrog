Based on this perspective, Bracht (2013) argues that physical education
(PE) has been regarded as an extension of the medical
institution, primarily functioning through the implementation of physical exercises. According
to Rigo, Pardo, and Silveira (2007), this viewpoint contributed to
the categorization of individuals within society and schools as either
healthy or unhealthy, and as more or less skilled, thereby
increasing the potential for student exclusion. This conceptualization of PE
has undergone modifications as a result of advancements in the
human and social sciences, particularly in fields related to health,
since its initial, limited framework was found to be insufficient
in addressing the various influencing factors (Paiva et al., 2017).
