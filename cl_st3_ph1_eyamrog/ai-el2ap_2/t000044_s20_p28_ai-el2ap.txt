Wray et al. (2017) investigated whether children with language disorders
utilize gestures as a compensatory strategy for their language difficulties.
The findings indicate that gesture and language constitute an integrated
communication system, with deficits in gesture frequently co-occurring with impairments
in spoken communication.
