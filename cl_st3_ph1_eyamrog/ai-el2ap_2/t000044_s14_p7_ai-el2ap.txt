After selecting the 69 articles based on the established criteria,
we initially categorized them according to teaching levels to identify
the stages of the academic trajectory with the highest concentration
of research on gestures in teaching and learning processes. Additionally,
we organized the articles chronologically by publication date to assess
trends in the volume of research on gestures over time,
thereby indicating potential changes in research interest. The final categorization
of the articles identified in phase 1 was conducted through
a content analysis of each article, with categories emerging inductively
from the reading process.
