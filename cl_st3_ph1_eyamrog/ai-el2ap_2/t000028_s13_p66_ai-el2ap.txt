The numbers can be represented on cards using tactile materials
such as relief glue, popsicle sticks, or beads. If the
student is familiar with these formats, both numerals and number
words can also be presented in Braille. Image 7 provides
examples of such cards in Braille, which were developed as
part of a Special Education course.
