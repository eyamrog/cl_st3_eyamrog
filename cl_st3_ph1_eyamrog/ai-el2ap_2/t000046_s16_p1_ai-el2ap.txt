This study employs a descriptive research design, which, according to
Thomas, Nelson, and Silverman (2012, p. 293), is defined as
"a study of status." It utilizes the qualitative approach outlined
by Minayo (1994), which addresses specific research questions and focuses
on aspects of reality that are not amenable to quantification.
