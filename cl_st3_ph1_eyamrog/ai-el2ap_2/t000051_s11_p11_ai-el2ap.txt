This perspective represents a significant advantage over other approaches to
discourse studies. Many critical discourse approaches conceptualize ideology as an
external force that distorts or corrupts an otherwise ideal social
order, and they often assume that Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA)
can reliably distinguish truth from falsehood through discourse analytic methods
(Pennycook, 2021, p. 106). Structuralist or neo-Marxist frameworks, in particular,
tend to position ideology as a form of falsehood that
is intertwined with power—reflecting dominant worldviews—while positing that truth exists
outside these power structures and can be revealed by the
analyst (Pennycook, 2021, p. 112). This orientation risks adopting a
patronizing stance, implying that individuals are passive recipients of ideology
and that only the analyst possesses the capacity to expose
ideological distortions (Pennycook, 2021, p. 107).
