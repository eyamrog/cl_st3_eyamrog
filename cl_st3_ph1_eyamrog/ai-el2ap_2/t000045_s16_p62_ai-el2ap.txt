It is therefore necessary to distinguish between the dynamics of
mediation during election periods and those that occur between elections.
Much of the existing research on brokers (Szwarcberg, 2012; Munoz,
2014; Aspinall, 2014; Gingerich, 2020) concentrates on electoral periods and
often generalizes findings to the entire term of office. As
a result, these studies may overemphasize factors specific to election
periods while overlooking dynamics that persist beyond these moments. While
it is reasonable to assume that politicians are motivated by
electoral success, this does not imply that all brokerage dynamics
can be reduced to campaign logic or that they cannot
acquire different political meanings outside of electoral contexts.
