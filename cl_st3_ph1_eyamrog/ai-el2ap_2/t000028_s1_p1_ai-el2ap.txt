The objective of this study is to propose adaptations of
activities from an English language textbook for use by blind
students in the sixth year of Basic Education. This qualitative
research, situated within the field of Applied Linguistics, includes a
literature review focused on the adaptation of educational materials for
blind students, drawing on previous studies in this area. Key
themes identified in the literature include a scarcity of research
and adapted materials for blind students, insufficient teacher preparation to
address the specific needs of these students, and challenges related
to fostering autonomy and inclusion in the classroom. The literature
was also examined to identify methodologies and strategies for adapting
didactic materials in the context of English language instruction. Subsequently,
the most widely adopted sixth grade English textbook in public
schools in Santa Maria in 2021, “Way to English for
Brazilian Learners - 6” (Franco & Tavares, 2015), was analyzed.
The analysis indicated that the “Vocabulary Corner” section, which contains
vocabulary activities for all units, is the most pertinent for
adaptation. Based on the findings from the literature review, adaptations
were proposed for six activities in the textbook to enhance
their inclusivity and accessibility for blind students.
