Autistic adults demonstrated a higher tendency to use unilateral rather
than bilateral gestures, which is a motor characteristic of individual
gestures associated with autism symptoms. Researchers suggest that co-speech gestures
may serve as a connection between non-verbal communication symptoms and
established differences in motor performance observed in individuals with autism.
