By the end of 2020, Brazil and India reported the
second and third highest numbers of coronavirus-related deaths globally. Both
countries were governed by right-wing authoritarian populist leaders: Jair Bolsonaro,
who became President of Brazil in 2019, and Narendra Modi
of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), who was
re-elected as Prime Minister of India in 2019. In his
first major address regarding the pandemic on March 24, 2020,
Bolsonaro claimed that Brazil was not particularly susceptible to the
virus. Concurrently, Modi criticized the media for what he characterized
as excessively pessimistic coverage of the pandemic, while the Indian
Council of Medical Research (ICMR), reportedly seeking to align with
the Prime Ministerâ€™s expectations, announced that a coronavirus vaccine would
be available by July 2020. In both countries, there was
a notable discrepancy between the empirical realities of the pandemic
and the narratives promoted by national leaders. The primary political
authority during the pandemic in both Brazil and India was
a charismatic executive who frequently regarded mainstream scientific experts as
adversaries.
