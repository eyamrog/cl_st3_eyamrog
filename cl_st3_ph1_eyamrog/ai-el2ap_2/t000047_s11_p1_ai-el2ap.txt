This study has established its focus on modes as the
central elements in meaning production within multimodality, and has further
clarified that mode serves as the primary conceptual framework for
analysis. In this context, mode functions as a tool for
examining the various manifestations of modes. This approach aligns with
Halliday and Matthiessen’s (2009) observation that grammar can be used
to illuminate itself, a process they term "grammatics," and is
analogous to Hall’s (1966) derivation of "proxemics" from the concept
of proximity. This raises the question of whether a self-referential
theory of modes, potentially termed "Modics," could be developed. As
previously discussed, mode is characterized by its systemic nature, which
is reflected in its attraction to system networks. Figure 1
below illustrates the systematic organization of mode.
