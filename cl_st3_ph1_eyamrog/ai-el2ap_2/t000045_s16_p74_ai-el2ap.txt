Our interviews indicate that representatives may be less dependent on
mayors for credit claiming than is commonly assumed in the
literature. Credit for benefits can be attributed through various actors,
including city councilors, former mayors, or other local supporters affiliated
with the representative’s political group. Additionally, legislative offices actively promote
the visibility of their actions, thereby limiting opportunities for mayors
to appropriate credit. Interviewees also noted that the increasing use
of social media enhances voters’ ability to access information independently
and enables representatives’ offices to communicate directly with constituents, further
reducing the mayor’s significance in the credit-claiming process.
