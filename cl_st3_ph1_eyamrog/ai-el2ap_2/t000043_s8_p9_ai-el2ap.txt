Similar to the Self-Controlled Case Series (SCCS) design, the Self-Controlled
Risk Interval (SCRI) design controls for fixed confounding factors such
as sex, race, genetic predispositions, preexisting health conditions, and geographical
location. However, for time-varying confounders such as seasonality and age,
explicit adjustments are necessary. For example, in vaccine studies, adverse
effects may vary particularly among children and can fluctuate over
the follow-up period, potentially leading to confounding with other factors
and resulting in false positive associations with vaccine effects (13,14).
Unlike the SCCS design, which includes both vaccinated and unvaccinated
individuals when analyzing adverse effects following vaccination, the SCRI design
includes only vaccinated cases (13). This characteristic is a primary
strength of the SCRI design, as it reduces bias that
may arise from differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals (16).
