Studies on distributive politics in Brazil indicate that: (i) voters
consider local concerns in their voting decisions, which increases the
likelihood of electing legislators known for securing resources for their
municipalities; (ii) a substantial proportion of legislators actively seek to
allocate resources and deliver services to municipalities; (iii) local leaders,
particularly mayors, play a significant role in mobilizing electoral support
for legislators; and (iv) the allocation of resources to municipalities
yields electoral benefits for both legislators and mayors.
