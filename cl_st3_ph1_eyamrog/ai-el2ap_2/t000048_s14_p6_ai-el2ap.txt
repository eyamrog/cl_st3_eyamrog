Flowering and fruiting data were collected through the analysis of
herbarium specimens, field observations, and a review of relevant literature.
Morphological terminology was adopted in accordance with the definitions provided
by Gon√ßalves and Lorenzi (2011). Illustrations were produced by hand
with the assistance of a stereomicroscope and finalized by the
illustrator Klei Rodrigo de Sousa.
