The species was considered extinct in Minas Gerais due to
the lack of recorded collections over a 30-year period, resulting
in its removal from the regional species list in 2008
(Diário do Executivo 1997, Diário do Executivo 2008). However, in
2012, it was reclassified as “Least Concern” (CNCFlora 2012c).
