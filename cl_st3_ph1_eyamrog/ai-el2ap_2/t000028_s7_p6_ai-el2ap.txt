Currently, various types of physical, mental, and sensory impairments, as
well as the education of students with disabilities, are widely
recognized and discussed in Brazil. In the past, however, such
students were often referred to using pejorative and discriminatory language.
Until the 1970s, individuals with disabilities were largely segregated from
society and denied fundamental rights, including access to appropriate education.
Significant changes began to occur nationally during the 1960s and
1970s, marked by the introduction of the first Law of
Guidelines and Bases of National Education and the establishment of
the National Center for Special Education (CENESP), which initiated the
process of standardizing the treatment of people with disabilities and
securing their right to education (ALVES, 2017, p. 15). Subsequently,
three additional laws concerning the guidelines and bases of national
education were enacted: Law 4.024/61 (1961), which addressed education and
guaranteed the right to schooling for the Brazilian population; Law
5.692 (1971), which established guidelines and bases for secondary education,
among other provisions; and Law 9.394/96 (1996), the current legislation,
which delineates the responsibilities of municipal, state, and federal governments
across the three stages of Brazilian education (preschool, primary, and
secondary education).
