This scoping review provides a systematic summary of the available
topical treatments for pain management associated with malignant fungating wounds
(MFWs). The review identifies opioids, anesthetics, and antimicrobials as topical
therapies relevant to clinical practice; however, there is a limited
number of prospective interventional studies evaluating their effectiveness. Furthermore, none
of the included studies assessed cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit, which are
important considerations for clinical implementation.
