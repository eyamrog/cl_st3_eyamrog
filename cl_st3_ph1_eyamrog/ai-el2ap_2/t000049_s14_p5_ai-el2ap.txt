Laissez-faire. In this approach, the adult assumes an observer role
and refrains from intervening to promote exploratory activity, intervening only

this approach is to assess whether, and to what extent,
a condition of complete freedom and autonomy—without adult interference—affects the
occurrence and characteristics of scientific exploration behaviors in children.
