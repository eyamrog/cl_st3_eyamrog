In the category of “Absence of diseases,” health is conceptualized
in strictly biological terms. According to Rigo, Pardo, and Silveira
(2007), this perspective dichotomizes individuals as either healthy or sick.
This understanding has informed a substantial body of knowledge and
has influenced the development of intervention strategies in school physical
education, which were predominant for many years and continue to
be observed in current practices (Oliveira, Gomes, & Bracht, 2014).
