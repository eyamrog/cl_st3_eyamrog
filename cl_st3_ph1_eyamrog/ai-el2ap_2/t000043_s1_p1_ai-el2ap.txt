Self-Controlled Case Series (SCCS) and Self-Controlled Risk Interval (SCRI) study
designs are methodologies in which cases serve as their own
controls, and they are frequently employed in pharmacovigilance to investigate
rare events. Currently, there is no established instrument for assessing
the methodological quality of studies utilizing these designs. Critical appraisal
of both primary and secondary studies is essential, as it
allows readers to evaluate the rigor of the study's methodology
and to consider this assessment when interpreting the presented evidence.
This paper proposes an instrument adapted from an existing tool
designed for cohort studies, integrating elements from that tool with
the specific methodological features of SCCS and SCRI designs. The
proposed instrument is intended to facilitate the critical appraisal of
SCCS and SCRI studies by researchers and readers.
