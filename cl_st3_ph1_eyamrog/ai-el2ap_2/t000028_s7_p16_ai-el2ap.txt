Teaching an additional language to a blind student presents significant
challenges; however, it also offers opportunities for mutual learning, as
both the student and the teacher engage in the collaborative
development of new knowledge. Through this reciprocal process, students may
gradually gain confidence and achieve success in language acquisition, while
EAL teachers expand their understanding of accessible instructional materials and
effective strategies for supporting blind students in the classroom.
