The interviews indicate that legislators can be categorized into two
distinct types. The first type is policy-oriented, characterized by a
greater allocation of time and effort to lawmaking and institutional
activities. The second type prioritizes constituency service and places significant
value on relationships with municipalities and local leaders, which interviewees
often referred to as “political affairs.”
