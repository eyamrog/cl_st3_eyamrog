The data were entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet using
double data entry and subsequent validation to minimize potential errors.
The validated data were then exported to the Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25.0 for analysis. Sociodemographic
and clinical profile variables were described using absolute and relative
frequencies. The Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test with Lilliefors correction was applied to
assess the assumption of normality.
