From 1929 to 1932, Ecuador experienced an average annual growth
rate of 0.6%. However, during the subsequent recovery period, the
population segment affected by the crisis contributed minimally to increased
production, resulting in a slower recovery compared to other countries
in the Latin American region. Between 1932 and 1939, Ecuador's
average annual growth rate was 3.5%, whereas the average for
Latin America during the same period was 5% (Naranjo 2017).
