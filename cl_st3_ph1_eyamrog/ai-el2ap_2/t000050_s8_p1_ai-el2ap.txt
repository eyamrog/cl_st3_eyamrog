Leishmaniases are diseases caused by various species of the protozoan
parasite genus Leishmania, which are transmitted among humans and wild
or domestic vertebrate animals through the bites of blood-feeding female
sand flies [1]. In Brazil, American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) is
endemic; however, limited information is available regarding its impact on
indigenous populations, particularly those residing in remote areas with minimal
contact with non-indigenous individuals outside their territories. To investigate the
sand fly fauna associated with ACL outbreaks among the Suruwaha
and Waj√£pi indigenous groups between 2012 and 2014, fieldwork was
conducted to collect sand flies and identify potential vector species.
Specimens were identified using taxonomic keys available in the literature
[3,4] by experienced taxonomists.
