Developing research based on gesture analysis is promising, as the
use of gestures in educational contexts remains under-researched and is
considered a relatively recent area of inquiry (Flood et al.,
2014). Gestures are naturally present in daily interactions and serve
as an additional communication channel between tutors and learners, yet
this aspect is insufficiently addressed in most learning theories. Investigating
the role of gestures may therefore provide valuable insights into
their potential to support and enhance the learning process.
