Following the donning of the lab coat in O-BT9 and
O-BT10, Social Actor 1 exits the scene, leaving only Social
Actor 2 present. At this stage, Social Actor 2 draws
viewersâ€™ attention to a carton of Oral-B, which is held
in the left hand. While Social Actor 2 continues to
hold the carton, Social Actor 1 re-enters the scene to
participate in the promotional activity alongside Social Actor 2. This
sequence demonstrates a turn-taking interaction, as described by van Leeuwen
(2005). The arrangement of this exchange facilitates cooperative engagement between
Social Actor 1 and Social Actor 2.
