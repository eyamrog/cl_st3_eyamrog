According to Simão and Scatena (2004), the bracts of the
specimens collected from Núcleo Picinguaba exhibit a red-orange coloration on
both the internal and external surfaces, which distinguishes them from
the material analyzed in the present study, despite both originating
from the same region. These observations suggest that the species
displays both bicolored and, less frequently, tricolored bracts.
