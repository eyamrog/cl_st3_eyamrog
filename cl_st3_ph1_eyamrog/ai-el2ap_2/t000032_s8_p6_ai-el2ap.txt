Hagan et al. (2017b) investigated the competitive anxiety responses of
elite and semi-elite table tennis athletes as temporal phenomena, utilizing
the multidimensional anxiety theory (Martens et al., 1990) as a
theoretical framework and employing the time-to-event paradigm. This paradigm considers
the temporal proximity of a significant event, such as a
championship match, as a critical factor influencing athletes' pre-competition emotional
states. Present mood states were found to be closely associated
with various contextual factors, including training load (Torres-Luque et al.,
2013), championship phase (Di Bonifácio, 2013; Vega Marcos et al.,
2008), self-perceived performance (Lewis et al., 2017), match location (R.
C. da Silva, 2013), injury incidence (Olmedilla, Ortega & Gómez,
2014), sports performance (Borges-Hernández, 2016), and match outcome (Hassmén &
Blomstrand, 1995; Nogueira, 2009).
