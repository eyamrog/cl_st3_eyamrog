A total of 322 species and 194 genera, belonging to
62 botanical families, were identified in the study area. Two
families of Pteridophytes were recorded, with Selaginella convoluta (Arn.) Spring
being the most prevalent species, occurring across all phytophysiognomies of
the farm, particularly in the riparian forest. Angiosperms were the
dominant group, comprising 60 families, including two basal angiosperm families—Annonaceae
and Aristolochiaceae—represented by Annona leptopetala (R.E.Fr.) H.Rainer and Aristolochia birostris
