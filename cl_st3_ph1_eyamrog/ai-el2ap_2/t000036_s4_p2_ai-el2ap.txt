The second period is characterized by an increase in monetary
emission, rising inflation, and heightened political instability. This instability facilitated
the emergence of populist governments, exemplified by the administration of
Velasco Ibarra. Similar developments occurred elsewhere in the region, as
seen in the governments of Getúlio Vargas in Brazil, Juan
Perón in Argentina, and Lázaro Cárdenas in Mexico.
