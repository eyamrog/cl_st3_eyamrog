The data indicate that city councilors serve as significant sources
of support for candidates, although their influence is less pronounced
than that of mayors. In the 2007 survey wave, nearly
24% of respondents identified support from local councilors as important
to their electoral success (5.7% in the first round and
18.3% in the second round). In the 2012 wave, just
over 18% of respondents reported the same (4.3% in the
first round and 14.1% in the second round). When considering
both mayors and councilors, 50.3% of respondents in 2007 cited
either as one of the two most important endorsements, whereas
this proportion decreased to 40.1% in the 2012 wave.
