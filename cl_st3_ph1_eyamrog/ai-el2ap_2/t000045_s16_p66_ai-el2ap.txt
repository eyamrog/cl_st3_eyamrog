Our analysis indicates that legislators serve as important sources of
information for local brokers. A substantial portion of the support
provided by legislative offices to their allies consists of information
derived from their specialized expertise and privileged access to state
executive agencies, resources that are often unavailable to leaders in
many municipalities. Consequently, there exists a mutual dependence on information
that is valued by each party involved in these interactions.
This interpretation aligns with the findings of Brierley and Nathan
(2021), who conducted one of the most comprehensive studies on
brokers to date. In their examination of broker selection in
Ghana, they found no evidence supporting the “information asymmetry model”
(2021:1). Instead, their results indicate that the selection of brokers
is influenced more by their upward connections and personal relationships
with party elites than by their ties to ordinary voters
or detailed knowledge about them. Brokers with stronger upward connections
possess greater knowledge and access to government agencies that control
the resources sought by voters.
