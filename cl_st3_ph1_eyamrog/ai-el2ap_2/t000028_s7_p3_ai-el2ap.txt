Although the Brazilian Ministry of Education provides Braille adaptations of
textbooks through the National Textbook Program (Programa Nacional do Livro
Didático – PNLD5) as required by schools, it is important
for teachers to be familiar with a range of adapted
materials to select the most appropriate methods based on students’
abilities and learning styles. These adaptations are significant not only
for blind students, who gain access to activities that would
otherwise be inaccessible, but also for teachers, as they offer
opportunities to utilize diverse materials that may benefit all students,
including both sighted and non-sighted learners.
