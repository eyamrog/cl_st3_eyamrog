The quality and effectiveness of factor score estimates were evaluated
following the guidelines of Ferrando and Lorenzo-Seva (2018). The Factor
Determinacy Index (FDI) was 0.982 for factor 1 and 0.933
for factor 2, indicating high levels of factor score determinacy.
ORION marginal reliability values were 0.964 for factor 1 and
0.871 for factor 2, supporting the reliability of the factorial
scores. Additionally, the Sensitivity Ratio (SR) was 5.200 for factor
1 and 2.597 for factor 2, further demonstrating the adequacy
of the factor score estimates.
