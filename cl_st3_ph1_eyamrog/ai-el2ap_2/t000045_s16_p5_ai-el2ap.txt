Nine legislators from the selected state region met the specified
criteria. Of these, six were re-elected in 2018 for the
2019â€“2022 term, while three were not re-elected. Due to the
inability to conduct interviews with the advisors of two legislators,
these cases were replaced with two legislators who had at
least 20% of their votes concentrated in the region. In
total, ten interviews were conducted, involving nine chiefs of staff
and one adviser representing nine different state representatives. The decision
to interview advisors rather than the legislators themselves was based
on the assumption that advisors would be more accessible and
possess a broader perspective on the legislative mandate. Among the
ten advisors interviewed, only one was based in the regional
office.
