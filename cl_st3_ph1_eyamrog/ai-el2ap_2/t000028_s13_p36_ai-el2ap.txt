Cargnin, Rossi, and Ticks (2018, p. 562): (1) the textbook
must have been approved by the PNLD in 2021, and
(2) it must have been the most frequently selected textbook
by sixth-grade English language teachers in public schools in Santa
Maria, RS, during the specified year. To identify the most
widely used textbook in Santa Maria, the SIMAD website was
accessed, and the relevant form was completed using the parameters
