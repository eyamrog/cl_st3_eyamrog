The literature indicates that female university students exhibit higher vulnerability
to anxiety (Blanco et al., 2021) and are more likely
to use anxiolytic medication (Martínez-Líbano et al., 2023). These findings
highlight the importance of conducting a more detailed analysis of
potential sex-related differences. Although some studies have addressed this issue,
the prevalence of anxiety and the use of anxiolytic medications
are typically examined separately in the national literature. Furthermore, national
empirical studies on prevalence predominantly focus on samples of medical
students (Chattu et al., 2020; Souza et al., 2022) and
nursing students (Marchi et al., 2013; Paixão et al., 2021).
