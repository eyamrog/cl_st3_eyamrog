The relationship between these participants persists as long as it
remains mutually beneficial. Some scholars contend that the risk of
broker disloyalty is greater in contexts where clientelist parties are
non-dominant and lack exclusive access to state resources (Mu√±oz, 2014;
Novaes, 2018). Aspinall (2014) suggests that, under these conditions, the
likelihood of defection and predatory behavior increases, particularly when brokers
who prioritize short-term material gains are prevalent within the network.
Additional factors influencing broker loyalty include the amount of resources
available to candidates, their perceived chances of electoral success (Aspinall,
2014), the degree of party identification among voters, and the
presence of programmatic linkages between brokers and party leaders (Novaes,
2018).
