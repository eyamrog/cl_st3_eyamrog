Leonardo observes a piece of cardboard from a broken kitchen
paper roll. After a brief pause, he states, "Here it
is broken." He surveys the area, approaches a box, and
selects a roll of blue tape. He presents the tape
to the observer, indicating the raised corner of the cardboard
roll, and remarks, "I have to fix it." While examining
the roll of tape, he attempts to locate the starting
point to lift and obtain a piece. At this point,
Peter and Alice join him. Leonardo begins to pull the
tape, applying significant force, and alternates his attention between the
cardboard roll and the tape, expressing uncertainty by asking, "How
do you do it... how do you do it?" Alice
suggests, "If we take scissors, we can cut it."
