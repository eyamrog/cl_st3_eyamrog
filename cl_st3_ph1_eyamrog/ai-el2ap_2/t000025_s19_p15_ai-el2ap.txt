Thirty-one studies (44.2%) investigated the use of topically applied opioids
to the wound bed for the management of malignant fungating
wound (MFW)-related pain. The study designs included non-systematic reviews (67.7%),
case studies (16.1%), randomized clinical trials (0.06%)—including a letter to
the editor reporting data from an unfinished trial—guidelines (0.03%), prospective
cohort studies (0.03%), and systematic reviews (0.03%). Of these 31
studies, slightly less than half identified specific opioids for the
treatment of MFW-related pain, most commonly recommending morphine. Additionally, two
studies mentioned oxycodone but did not provide details regarding its
formulation or methods of application, as summarized in Table 5.
