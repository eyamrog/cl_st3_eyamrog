Several studies on the Brazilian context emphasize the significance of
relationships between legislators and local politicians, as well as the
mediating role of the latter (Bezerra, 1999; Avelino, Biderman, and
Barone, 2012; Barone, 2014; Novaes, 2018). These works generally posit
that representatives allocate resources to their geographically concentrated constituencies, while
local brokers mobilize electoral support for the legislators in return.
However, much of the existing literature relies on assumptions regarding
actors' motivations and the observable outcomes of these alliances, often
without providing direct evidence of the underlying mechanisms. In this
paper, we assess the extent to which the theoretical framework
commonly used to analyze broker-boss relationships in comparative politics is
applicable to the relationship between legislators and local politicians in
Brazil. Specifically, we investigate how these relationships are established, maintained,
and dissolved, and compare our empirical findings with the predictions
derived from existing theory.
