The specimens from NÃºcleo Curucutu exhibit tricolored bracts, displaying red,
yellow, and green hues. The occurrence of three distinct colors
in bracts is infrequently documented in both the scientific literature
and exsiccatae descriptions. In many instances, only the predominant color,
red, is recorded, even when a second color is present
in the material under study.
