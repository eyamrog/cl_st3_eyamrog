To analyse the exercise of power through discursive struggle, Baxter
(2011) employs Bakhtin’s concepts of centripetal (centralising) and centrifugal (decentralising)
forces (Bakhtin, 1981, pp. 270–272). According to Baxter (2011, p.
123), marginalised discourses are more likely to be forgotten or
silenced in comparison to those that are central, as the
centre is readily legitimised as normative, typical, and natural, thereby
serving as a benchmark and conferring a position of privilege
and power relative to centrifugal discourses. Power is understood here
in a Foucauldian sense, as a phenomenon that requires explanation
rather than being assumed as an inherent condition of society
(Pennycook, 2021). Consequently, power is located within systems of meaning—namely,
discourses—through which social reality is constructed, rather than residing in
individuals or social groups (Baxter, 2011, p. 124). Centripetal discourses
possess greater power than centrifugal ones because their systems of
meaning are presented as social reality (Baxter, 2011, p. 124).
Through discourse, language is used not merely to reflect reality
but to produce it, thereby generating “domains of objects and
rituals of truth” (Foucault, 1979, p. 194). In Bakhtinian terms,
“social life and historical becoming” result in languages containing “a
multitude of concrete worlds, a multitude of bounded verbal-ideological and
social belief systems” (Bakhtin, 1981, p. 288), which means that
access is limited to competing accounts of truth (Pennycook, 2021,
p. 112). Thus, a Bakhtinian perspective on languages as worldviews
and on discursive struggle implies that meaning-making always occurs within
relations of power and that there is no truth independent
of power.
