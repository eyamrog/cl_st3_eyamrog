In the analysis of the conversation rendered in written form,
the lexeme "you" functions as a deictic element, referring to
viewers in a generic manner, as exemplified by the sentence
"You clean your teeth every morning." The phrases "your teeth"
and "your mouth" similarly serve a generic purpose, addressing the
target audience collectively. The communicator utilizes this generic reference to
establish a connection with the audience, linking it to linguistic
expressions such as "long lasting fresh breath," "fresh feeling," and
"strong and healthy teeth" to emphasize the dual benefits associated
with the Oral-B product.
