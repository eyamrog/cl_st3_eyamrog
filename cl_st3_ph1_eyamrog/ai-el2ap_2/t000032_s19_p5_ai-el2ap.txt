Factor V (Physiologic) exhibited the most substantial change during the
study, as the observed differences indicated a consistent pattern of
Factor presence across the temporal sequence of the Series of
Events, with notable alterations specifically in Series 3. The TR-POST
presence values were higher than both MATCH and TR-PRE values
across all three Series. In Series 3, the presence values
of this Factor differed from those in Series 1 and
2. Specifically, TR-PRE presence values were higher in Series 1
(p=0.007) and Series 2 (p=0.000) compared to their respective MATCH
values, whereas in Series 3, the TR-PRE value was lower
than that of MATCH 3 (p=0.000). Additionally, the MATCH presence
values varied among the three Series, with the Series 2
MATCH value being lower than those of Series 1 and
3. Overall, analysis of the interaction between Series and Event
demonstrated a consistent pattern in the presence of mood state
Factors throughout the temporal sequence for all three Series, although
Series 3 displayed significant and specific changes compared to Series
1 and 2.
