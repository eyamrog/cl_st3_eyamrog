It is important to note that Figure 1 does not
represent all possible modes globally. A single mode may encompass
several sub-modes that function within its domain; for example, human
beings and clothing, architectural structures, and automobiles can each be
considered as units or sub-modes (Oâ€™Halloran & Baldry, 2011). However,
the inclusion of language, image, color, and music as entry
points appears sufficient for illustrating the nature of modes commonly
employed in various communicative contexts. As depicted in Figure 1,
language comprises both spoken and written forms, with multiple theoretical
perspectives evaluating their characteristics within linguistic frameworks (Kress, 2011; Yule,
2020; Jaworski & Coupland, 2016). The category of image is
further divided into animate and inanimate components, each with its
own subdivisions. Elements such as proxemics, gesture, and gaze have
been examined as aspects of spatial and gestural communication (Hall,
1974; Hostetter, 2012; Kendon, 2015; Antas & Gembalczyk, 2018). Martin
and Zappavigna (2019) suggest that gestures function as indicators of
paralanguage, while Kress (2010) describes the use of non-human animals
to represent humans as an instance of transduction.
