This conception was adopted by the National Curriculum Parameters (PCN)
(BRASIL, 1998; 2000) and, more recently, by the National Common
Curriculum Base (BNCC) (BRASIL, 2017). A key aspect emphasized in
these and other policy documents is that health should be
addressed by all members of the school community. However, analyses
of these normative proposals from the perspective of collective health
(WESTPHAL, 2013) indicate that they continue to follow a behavioral
approach, which, in alignment with the natural sciences, prioritizes the
promotion of healthy lifestyles.
