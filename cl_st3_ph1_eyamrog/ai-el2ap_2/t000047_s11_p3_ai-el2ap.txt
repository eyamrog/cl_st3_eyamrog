A system network incorporates the concept of delicacy, which serves
as the primary principle for organizing system indices in relation
to one another. Delicacy refers to the degree of detail
and specificity within a semiotic resource, establishing a hierarchical scale
from general to specific. It involves the arrangement of systems
from left to right based on entry conditions, as described
by Dalamu (2019b). Consequently, the system network reflects the range
of choices available in communicative interactions due to its inherent
optionality. As illustrated in Figure 1, communicative modes such as
language, image, color, and music are presented as terms with
corresponding entry conditions within the network system.
