The data indicate that wages fluctuated in direct correlation with
the price index. Until 1932, real wages increased due to
the deflationary environment, as nominal wages remained stable from 1929
onward. After 1932, following the abandonment of gold standard policies,
inflation exerted a direct effect on wages: real wages declined
while employment rose, a trend attributable to the expansion of
the money supply and consistent with the Phillips curve (Naranjo
2021). As shown in Figure 3, inflationary growth ceased in
1937, at which point wages also began to stabilize.
