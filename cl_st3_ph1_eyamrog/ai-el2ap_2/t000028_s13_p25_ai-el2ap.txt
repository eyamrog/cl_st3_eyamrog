Alternative approaches can be investigated to address issues of segregation
in the classroom. Camargo and Nardi (2006) examined the lack
of inclusion of blind students in physics classes, with the
objective of raising awareness among undergraduate teachers and identifying potential
solutions. Their study consisted of both preparatory and practical phases,
during which prospective physics teachers were tasked with designing a
course that included activities suitable for 35 sighted and two
blind students. In this context, the undergraduate participants encountered challenges
in developing instructional methods that did not depend on visual
resources, as physics instruction frequently relies on the use of
blackboards and visual demonstrations. To enhance the inclusion of blind
students and address these challenges, the undergraduates proposed physics activities
that incorporated complementary and collaborative strategies, such as oral presentations,
group reading and discussion, and role-playing exercises (Camargo & Nardi,
2006).
