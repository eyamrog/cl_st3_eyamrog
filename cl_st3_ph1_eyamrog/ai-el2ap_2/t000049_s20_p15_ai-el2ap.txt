Similar considerations apply to the identification of articulated epistemic behaviors,
defined as complex attitudes exhibited by children when investigating an
observed phenomenon. Specifically, analysis of the collected data indicated that
children in groups A and B, who participated in the
'promotion from within' approach, demonstrated a greater variety and complexity
of epistemic behaviors related to scientific investigation (A and B
= 11 instances), such as exploration, experimentation, and issue identification,
in order to deepen their understanding of the phenomenon. In
contrast, group C exhibited both a lower frequency (C =
4 instances) and reduced complexity (limited to constructing and exploration)
in behaviors associated with learning through scientific investigation. The tables
below present the quantity and quality of the articulated epistemic
behaviors observed during the investigation of different phenomena.
