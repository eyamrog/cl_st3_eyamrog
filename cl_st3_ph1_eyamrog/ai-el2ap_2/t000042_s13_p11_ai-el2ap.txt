The emergence of the novel coronavirus in India was preceded
by communal unrest following the announcement of the Citizenship Amendment
Act in January 2020, which was widely criticized for discriminating
against Muslims. In March 2020, a COVID-19 outbreak occurred at
a gathering of the Islamic organization Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi,
resulting in unsubstantiated claims that the congregation was the source
of thousands of coronavirus cases and numerous deaths across India.
Misinformation circulated on social media, falsely alleging that Muslims intentionally
contaminated food and water with the virus. The Modi administration
issued a condemnation of this wave of communal hostility only
after a delay. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing social
taboos, such as untouchability, which are linked to the entrenched
caste system. Concepts of purity and pollution, central to the
caste-based stratification of Indian society into Brahmins (priests), Kshatriyas (warriors),
Vaisyas (traders), Sudras (workers), and the unclassified Dalits—who are marginalized
due to their association with occupations such as sanitation, cremation,
and animal carcass removal—remained influential. Dalits were disproportionately affected during
the first wave of the pandemic. During this period, necropolitics
in India was evident in the denial of human rights
to both the Muslim minority and Dalits, the stigmatization of
menial labor, and increased hostility toward migrant workers.
