Figure 1 presents the search procedures employed in this study.
Following the definition of the research problem, as previously discussed,
the initial step involved specifying the databases to be used,
selecting appropriate search terms (keywords), and determining the search period.
Once these parameters were established, the second stage entailed conducting
the search for studies relevant to the central theme of
the research.
