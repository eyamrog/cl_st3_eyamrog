The self-controlled case series (SCCS) method estimates the relative incidence
(RI) of events of interest by comparing the incidence of
events during a predefined risk period following a transient exposure
to the incidence during a control period. The RI is
calculated as the ratio of the number of events occurring
in the risk period to the number of events occurring
in the control period (1,6,11).
