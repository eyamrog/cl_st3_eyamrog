For the overall or composite assessment in each section, stars
are allocated based on specific criteria. In section 1, a
maximum of three stars may be awarded if the study
population is representative of the general population, as in vaccine
safety studies, if there is clear ascertainment of the exposure
of interest, and if it is demonstrated that the outcome
of interest occurred during the observation period. In section 2,
up to two stars may be awarded if the study
accounts for time-varying confounders or if the follow-up period is
sufficiently short to minimize the impact of time-related confounding factors.
In section 3, a maximum of five stars may be
awarded if the study provides a clear method for confirming
the outcome, clearly defines the risk and control periods, ensures
that the duration of these periods is adequate for analyzing
the outcome of interest, and achieves complete follow-up of cases
or provides an account of cases lost during follow-up. Overall,
a study can receive a maximum of 10 stars.
