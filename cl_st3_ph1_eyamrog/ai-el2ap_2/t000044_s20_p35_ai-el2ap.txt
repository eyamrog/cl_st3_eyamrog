In the classroom, when a student raises his arm emphatically
in response to a teacherâ€™s question, or another student deliberately
avoids making eye contact with the teacher, both individuals are
employing physical behaviors to indicate their desire to answer the
question. These actions are examples of non-verbal communication (Goldin-Meadow, 2017).
