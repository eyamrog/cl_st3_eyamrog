The scope of health education extends beyond guidance on appropriate
attire for physical education to ensure comfort, safety, and injury
prevention. It also includes instruction on maintaining personal hygiene, cleanliness,
and organization, not only with respect to the body but
also regarding the surrounding environment. This involves promoting responsible behaviors
such as proper waste disposal and overall environmental stewardship. Health,
therefore, should not be understood solely as the study of
the human body or physical condition, but rather as encompassing
the education of students about the broader environment in which
they live.
