Global research demonstrates that the prevalence of anxiety is higher
among college students compared to non-college young adults of the
same age group. For example, Auerbach et al. (2016) reported
a prevalence of 31% (n = 1,572) among college students,
whereas the prevalence among non-students was 21.4% (n = 4,178).
In a subsequent study, Auerbach et al. (2018) found that
31.1% (n = 13,984) of students met criteria for an
anxiety condition. In the Brazilian context, Demenech et al. (2021)
estimated that approximately 37.75% (n = 3,193) of higher education
students exhibited symptoms of anxiety.
