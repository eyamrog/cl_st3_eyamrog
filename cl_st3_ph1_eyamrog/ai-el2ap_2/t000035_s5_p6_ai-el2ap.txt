However, treatment with complete dentures is not always successful, with
dissatisfaction reported in approximately 10% to 20% of cases. Silva
et al. found that dissatisfaction may affect an even greater
proportion of individuals, sometimes resulting in the abandonment of dentures,
as observed in one participant of their study. In their
interview-based evaluation of twelve patients treated with complete dentures, three
patients reported being completely satisfied, while nine were classified as
dissatisfied. Among the dissatisfied group, six considered their dentures to
be generally acceptable but reported difficulties in use, particularly with
lower dentures, whereas three were entirely dissatisfied and unable to
use the dentures due to pain and concerns about appearance.
A minority of patients may never adapt to mucosa-supported dentures,
which may be attributed to psychological factors, patient age, previous
experiences with dentures, or unmet expectations. This finding is supported
by the observation that two patients were not using their
dentures at the final interview, and one patient assigned a
score of zero for chewing, stability, and comfort of the
lower dentures. Additionally, there is a greater tendency for patients
to experience difficulty adapting to lower dentures compared to upper
dentures.
