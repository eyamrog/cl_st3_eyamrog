The Brazilian Federal Constitution and the Organic Health Laws (Law
No. 8,080/1990 and Law No. 9,836/1999) acknowledge the distinct ethnic
and cultural characteristics of indigenous peoples. The health needs of
the indigenous population necessitate a complementary and targeted model of
healthcare services focused on the protection, promotion, and recovery of
health, as outlined in the National Policy for the Health
Care of Indigenous Peoples and the Guidelines of the Indigenous
Component of the National Oral Health Policy. These policies aim
to ensure comprehensive care in alignment with the principles and
guidelines of the National Health Service (SUS), while respecting social,
cultural, geographical, historical, and political diversity, and recognizing the validity
of traditional medicine, in order to address factors contributing to
the increased vulnerability of this population to health problems.
