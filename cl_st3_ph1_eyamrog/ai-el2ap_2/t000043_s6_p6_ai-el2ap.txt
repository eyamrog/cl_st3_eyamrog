The self-controlled case series (SCCS) and self-controlled risk interval (SCRI)
are important study designs in pharmacoepidemiology, particularly for investigating rare
events following transient exposures, such as the association between influenza
vaccines and Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS). This paper introduces an initial
proposal for a quality assessment tool specifically tailored to these
study designs. The development of this tool was prompted by
the authors' previous need to evaluate the methodological quality of
SCCS and SCRI studies, during which no suitable instrument was
identified. Consequently, the authors adapted an existing tool and incorporated
methodological considerations unique to SCCS and SCRI designs. The proposed
tool is intended to assist researchers in systematically assessing the
methodological rigor of SCCS and SCRI studies, which is especially
relevant in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, where these
designs are likely to be widely applied to evaluate adverse
events following Covid-19 vaccination.
