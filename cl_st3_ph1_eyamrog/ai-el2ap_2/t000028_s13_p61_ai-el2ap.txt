Encouraging cooperation and interaction between sighted and non-sighted students is
essential and can be facilitated through group activities (Camargo &
Nardi, 2006; Biagini & Gon√ßalves, 2017). For example, Activity A
(see Image 4), which addresses vocabulary related to occupations, may
be adapted into a group-based interactional task designed to promote
the development of speaking and listening skills.
