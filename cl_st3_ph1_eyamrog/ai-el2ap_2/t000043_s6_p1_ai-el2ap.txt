Various quality assessment tools exist for both quantitative and qualitative
studies. Researchers sometimes modify existing instruments or develop new ones
to address specific requirements, as was the case in this
study. In 2018, during the evaluation of self-controlled case series
(SCCS) and self-controlled risk interval (SCRI) studies included in a
systematic review, no suitable existing tool was identified. Consequently, the
Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort studies was adapted for this
purpose.
