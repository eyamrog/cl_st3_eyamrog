Evaluation remains a subject of considerable debate and controversy within
the field of education. While there is broad consensus that
evaluation is a complex process involving observation, documentation, and reflection
to enhance educational practices, some traditional perspectives persist in viewing
evaluation primarily as a tool for assessing and judging student
performance (Vertecchi, 2016).
