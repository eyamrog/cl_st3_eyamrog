The evidence presented in this section indicates that principal-agent theories
are inadequate for fully capturing the dynamics between state representatives
and their local brokers. The risks inherent in these relationships
do not primarily stem from conflicting objectives or from informational
asymmetries that favor the agents. Instead, the data demonstrate substantial
alignment between the goals of local brokers and representatives, particularly
in their shared interest in securing electoral success by providing
resources and benefits valued by the local population and by
responding to private requests. Furthermore, when politicians select brokers based
on their upward connections with party elites, as noted by
Brierley and Nathan (2021) and supported by our findings, the
likelihood of defection and opportunistic behavior is reduced. The evidence
also shows that both parties often occupy dual roles within
these relationships, resulting in mutual challenges related to commitment and
information asymmetry. Although both representatives and brokers possess the option
to exit these relationships (Novaes, 2018), practical barriers often limit
this possibility. While it may be rational for legislators to
continuously expand their local networks by incorporating additional mayors and
councilors, and for mayors to pursue more advantageous partnerships, such
strategies entail significant, and sometimes prohibitive, costs as highlighted by
Hicken and Nathan (2020) and corroborated by our interview data.
These factors contribute to the sustained alignment of objectives between
state representatives and local brokers.
