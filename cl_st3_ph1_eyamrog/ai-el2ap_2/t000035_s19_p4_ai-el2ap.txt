Table 3 presents the results of the descriptive analysis of
the scores assigned by all patients after one year of
denture use (t1), which were generally high. One patient assigned
a score of zero for chewing as well as for
the stability and comfort of the lower dentures. The scores
for chewing, aesthetics, and hygiene were significantly lower for the
lower dentures compared to the upper dentures (p<0.05).
