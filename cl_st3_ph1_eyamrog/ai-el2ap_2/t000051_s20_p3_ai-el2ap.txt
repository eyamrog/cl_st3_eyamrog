At its core, this issue concerns whether those in positions
of power are permitted to violate established legal norms, specifically
whether the international community will tolerate actions by leaders such
as Putin that seek to reestablish dynamics reminiscent of 19th-century
great power politics, or whether collective measures will be taken
to uphold international law and constrain aggressive behavior by state
actors.
