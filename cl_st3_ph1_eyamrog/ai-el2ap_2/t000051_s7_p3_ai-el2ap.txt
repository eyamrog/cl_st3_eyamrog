This article examines the policy statement delivered by German Federal
Chancellor Olaf Scholz in the German parliament on 27 February
2022, with a focus on identifying the major discourses present
in the speech and analyzing how Scholz employs these discourses
to legitimize his policies. The analysis is conducted in two
main parts. First, the study investigates the attitudes conveyed in
the speech, specifically the emotional responses and judgments expressed, and
how Scholz positions himself in relation to particular discourses, utilizing
the appraisal theory framework (Martin & White, 2005). Second, the
article explores the speaker’s engagement, analyzing how competing discourses are
introduced and negotiated, conceptualized as a centripetal-centrifugal dynamic according to
Bakhtinian dialogism, and how this process serves to justify Scholz’s
policy decisions. The article begins by outlining the genre of
policy statements and their communicative functions.
