To effectively organize and manage an experience similar to that
described previously within the daily routine of a school, several
considerations should be addressed. Specifically, it is important to establish
small groups of children at designated times and to systematically
collect documentation, either through video recordings or traditional observation methods
such as paper and pen, for subsequent analysis with colleagues.
The process of reflecting on necessary actions should remain independent
of both the data collected during the experience and the
initial planning intentions. This reflective practice, as described by Sch√∂n
(1993), integrates planning, implementation, and documentation, with the objective of
evaluating the process as it unfolds and identifying potential adjustments.
Such an approach requires deliberate choices by the teacher, particularly
regarding the organization of activities and the application of evaluation
tools. The primary purpose of evaluation in this context is
to regulate and support the learning process by informing improvements
to the educational environment, rather than to assess or judge
the performance of individual children.
