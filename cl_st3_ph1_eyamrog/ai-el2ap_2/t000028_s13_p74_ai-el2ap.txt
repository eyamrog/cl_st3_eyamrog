For activity F, teachers may incorporate a song that introduces
various forms of greetings. Numerous options are available online, allowing
teachers to select those most appropriate for their class. One
recommended resource is the video titled “Hello Song for Kids
- Greeting Song for Kids - The Singing Walrus,” available
on The Singing Walrus YouTube channel. This particular video is
suggested due to its interactive format and its relevance to
students’ daily routines.
