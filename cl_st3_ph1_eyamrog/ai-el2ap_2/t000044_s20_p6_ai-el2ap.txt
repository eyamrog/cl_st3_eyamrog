These categories facilitate the identification of the potential contributions and
relevance of gestures to the teaching process, as evidenced by
research conducted in classroom settings across various educational levels. The
first category demonstrates that gestures produced by both teachers and
students can support students’ knowledge construction; specifically, gestures enable students
to express and comprehend concepts that may otherwise be abstract
or disconnected from their everyday experiences. The second and third
categories highlight the significance of analyzing non-verbal communication, particularly gestures,
in both students and teachers, for the teaching and learning
process. Such analysis provides insights into students’ questions, levels of
understanding, and other factors that can inform and enhance instructional
practices.
