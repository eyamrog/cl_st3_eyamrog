After every two units, the textbook includes sections with content
review activities that cover the vocabulary and grammar introduced in
the preceding two units. Subsequently, a section titled “Vocabulary Corner”
provides activities focused on the main vocabulary presented throughout all
eight units. The following section, “Language Reference in Context,” offers
activities related to the grammar covered during the course, utilizing
authentic texts and various discourse genres such as comic strips,
posters, and signs. The final pages of the textbook are
allocated to the Glossary, Index, and Bibliography sections.
