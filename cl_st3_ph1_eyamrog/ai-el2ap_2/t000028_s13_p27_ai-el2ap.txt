Biagini and Gonçalves (2017, p. 8) identify cooperation, solidarity, and
respect for differences among students as key factors that can
be fostered through group activities. In their study, they implemented
a group reading activity involving four students, each assigned a
specific role: reader, writer, communicator, and coordinator. The activity was
structured in three stages: first, students individually responded to the
teacher’s questions and then discussed their responses within their groups
to formulate a collective answer; second, groups presented their answers
to the entire class, followed by a class-wide discussion and
the generation of new responses; third, each group communicated its
conclusions and results to the class. Although the researchers selected
a text from the field of Natural Sciences for this
activity, they note that the approach is adaptable to other
disciplines, including English language studies. Additionally, Biagini and Gonçalves (2017)
conducted an experiment on the importance of water for plants,
as well as issues related to potability and water treatment.
In this context, they emphasized the value of multisensory resources—such
as tactile, olfactory, and auditory observations—in facilitating comprehension for blind
students.
