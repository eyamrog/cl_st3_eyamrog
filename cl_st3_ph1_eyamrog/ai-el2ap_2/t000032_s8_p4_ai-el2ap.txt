Appropriate instruments are required to investigate the broad spectrum of
mood states in sports contexts. The Present Mood States List
(PMSL), developed by Engelmann (1986, 2001), is a Brazilian instrument
designed to assess both positive and negative mood states. It
is based on extensive empirical research conducted in Brazil and
is considered to provide probabilistic access to individuals' subjective states.
The PMSL measures the presence of various mood states at
the time of response and has been utilized in studies
examining present mood states in sports within Brazil (Bueno &
Di Bonif√°cio, 2007, 2009; Bueno & Souza, 2019).
