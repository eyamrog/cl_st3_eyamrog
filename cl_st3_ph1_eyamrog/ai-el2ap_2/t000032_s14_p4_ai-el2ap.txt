Players were divided into four groups based on their field
positions: Goalkeepers (n=2), Defenders (n=7), Midfielders (n=7), and Forwards (n=2).
The presence values for each PMSL factor, as defined by
Engelmann (1986), were calculated by multiplying the score assigned by
each participant on the scale next to each locution by
its corresponding correlation coefficient (charge) with each factor. To enable
comparisons among factors with different numbers of correlated locutions, a
standardization procedure was applied to normalize each presence value to
a 0â€“1 scale. Specifically, for each PMSL factor, the maximum
possible value was determined by multiplying all positive charges by
5 (the maximum value on the PMSL scale) and all
negative charges by 1 (the minimum value on the LEAP
scale), followed by calculating the mean of these values. Conversely,
the minimum possible value was calculated by multiplying positive charges
by 1 and negative charges by 5, and then computing
the mean. The minimum value was then adjusted to 0,
and the maximum value was adjusted accordingly to maintain the
scale proportion (e.g., if the minimum value was shifted from
2 to 0, the maximum value was reduced by 2
as well). The adjusted maximum value was then set to
1 by dividing it by itself, and the original presence
value (ranging from 1 to 5) was divided by the
adjusted maximum value to yield the standardized presence value for
the PMSL factor. This standardization procedure was applied to all
presence values for all participants across all events. The mean
standardized presence values for each PMSL factor were used for
statistical analysis.
