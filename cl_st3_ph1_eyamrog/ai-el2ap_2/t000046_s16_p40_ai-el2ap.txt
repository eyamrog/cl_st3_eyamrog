It is challenging for me to provide a comprehensive response
as I feel unprepared, and my comments may seem self-evident.
Regarding physical education (PE), it is important to recognize that
it extends beyond the undergraduate curriculum and should be considered
as part of the broader health sector. For example, during
our planning, a philosophy teacher—who is not a specialist in
this area—suggested reintroducing practices from previous years, such as administering
vaccines to students within the school setting rather than relying
on parents to take their children to health facilities, as
parents often do not do so. This raises the question
of why health departments do not collaborate more directly with
schools to provide such services. Similar initiatives have been implemented
by the city’s dental department, which has conducted educational activities
on oral hygiene, including supervised brushing with fluoride. I believe
that comparable health interventions within schools would also be feasible
and beneficial.
