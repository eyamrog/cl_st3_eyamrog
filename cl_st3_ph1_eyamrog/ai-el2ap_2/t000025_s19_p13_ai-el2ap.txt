Only one case study (1.4%) published in 2014 (Stringer et
al., 2014) investigated the use of a cream containing 3%
essential oils for managing malignant fungating wound (MFW) symptoms in
12 patients, primarily women with breast cancer aged between 40
and 81 years. The specific essential oil ingredients were not
disclosed. The study did not standardize the wound dressings or
provide detailed information regarding the formulation of the cream or
the frequency and method of application. According to the authors,
six patients reported an improvement in pain, with their maximum
pain scores reduced to zero on a Likert scale.
