To identify educational strategies and adult functions consistent with the
'promotion from within' approach, the categories proposed by Bondioli and
Savio (1996, 2001) were utilized. These authors emphasized the significance
of an intervention style that supports, rather than overrides, the
child’s interests and perspectives. Specifically, the adult responds to the
child’s verbal and non-verbal behaviors in a reflective and non-judgmental
manner, poses open-ended questions that permit a wide range of
possible responses, and introduces new materials or activities that are
aligned with the ongoing actions or interests of the child
or group.
