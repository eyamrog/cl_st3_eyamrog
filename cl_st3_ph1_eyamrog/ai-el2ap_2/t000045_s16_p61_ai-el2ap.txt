The interviewees generally minimized the significance of the election period
in establishing relationships with local brokers, emphasizing instead that engagement
with municipalities, local groups, and voters occurs continuously over the
years. They indicated that elections primarily serve as opportunities to
publicize actions and distribute benefits. Nevertheless, the influence of the
electoral cycle on the dynamics of these relationships cannot be
disregarded. For instance, representatives are prohibited from channeling amendments directly
to civil organizations during election years. Additionally, an amendment approved
in one year may be implemented in the subsequent year,
at which point neither the author of the amendment nor
the allied mayor who requested it may still hold office.
