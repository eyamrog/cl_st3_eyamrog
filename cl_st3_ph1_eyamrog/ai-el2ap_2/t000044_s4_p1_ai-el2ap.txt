The development of published research on the use of gestures
in classroom settings demonstrates a clear increase in scholarly interest
over recent years. Since 2009, there has been a notable
rise in the number of articles addressing nonverbal communication, both
in terms of practical classroom applications and theoretical discussions, published
in academic journals. This growing body of literature highlights the
significance of gestures as a communication channel, with empirical findings
indicating that gestures can facilitate second language acquisition, support inclusive
education, and enhance the teaching of science and mathematicsâ€”subjects that
are often perceived as challenging by students.
