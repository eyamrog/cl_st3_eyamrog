This paper reviews current research on the role of gestures
in educational contexts, with a particular focus on gestural communication.
Studies have examined the use of gestures across various educational
levels, including their application in second language acquisition, inclusive education,
and science and mathematics instruction. The evidence indicates that gestural
communication facilitates both the introduction and assessment of new vocabulary
in second language teaching, serves as an additional resource for
teachers and students with disabilities, and supports the teaching of
abstract and complex concepts in science and mathematics. Notably, research
consistently demonstrates that gesture functions as a significant, though often
underrecognized, channel for information exchange, learning, and reasoning.
