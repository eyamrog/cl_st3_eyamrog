As shown in HLMA 4, the testimony of the woman
appears to prompt the indexical social actors to renew their
promotion of the toothpaste, encouraging both viewers and the testifier
to "Stay strong" and "Stay fresh." Consequently, viewers are advised
to rely on the dual benefits provided by Oral-B's 2-IN-1
formula. Consumers are encouraged to consistently use the product, as
regular use is associated with maintaining strong teeth and long-lasting
fresh breath. At this point, the image of Oral-B is
depicted in motion, as illustrated in three instances (O-BT30 to
O-BT32). These transcripts are noteworthy because they demonstrate the dynamic
movement of the toothpasteâ€™s white content, which is shown rolling
from an upper source down to the labeled carton of
Oral-B.
