In the "Environment" category, Physical Education (PE) was identified as
contributing to a comprehensive understanding of health among students by
utilizing everyday situations as opportunities for intervention. This approach indicates
that PE is not limited to individual concerns but also
examines the relationship between individuals and their social environments. However,
Becalli and Gomes (2011) highlight the persistence of elements associated
with a hygienist perspective within the discipline. In the present
study, this perspective was observed in the statements of teacher
Daniela, who emphasized themes such as hygiene, cleanliness, and organization.
