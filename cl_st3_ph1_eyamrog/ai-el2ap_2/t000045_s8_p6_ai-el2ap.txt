There are several mechanisms for establishing partnerships, including the development
of personal relationships and geographical proximity. The evidence presented indicates
that reputation is a critical factor in the selection of
brokers, while political parties function more as potential veto points—contingent
on the local political context—than as primary criteria for alliance
formation. The analysis further demonstrates that the electoral benefits of
such partnerships for legislators are uncertain and require considerable effort
in information gathering, negotiation, and the prioritization of support for
local politicians. Additionally, the findings suggest that electoral defeats are
the primary cause of the dissolution of these relationships, and
that representatives generally do not seek to penalize local brokers
who fail to meet expectations.
