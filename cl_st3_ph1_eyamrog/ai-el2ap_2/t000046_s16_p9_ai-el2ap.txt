In addition, Umemura and Rosa (2020, p. 81) emphasize that
teachers have primarily been regarded as implementers and managers responsible
for supervising policies established by central public administration authorities. Similar
observations were made by Fernandes (2012), who, through a bibliographic
survey of the activities performed by coordinating teachers, identified their
roles in disseminating government proposals, developing projects, and being held
accountable for student performance in external evaluations.
