The primary distinction between the two study designs lies in
the definition of the observation period. In the self-controlled risk
interval (SCRI) design, the index date is the vaccination date,
which serves as the reference point for delineating both the
risk and control periods. In contrast, the self-controlled case series
(SCCS) design establishes an observation period that is independent of
the vaccination date, and all cases are identified within this
predefined observation period (14).
