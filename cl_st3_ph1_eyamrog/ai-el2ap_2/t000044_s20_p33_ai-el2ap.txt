Vogt and Kauschke (2017) investigated the role of iconic gestures
in facilitating word learning among children in Germany. Their findings
indicate that iconic gestures enhance the encoding of new vocabulary,
resulting in more effective word acquisition, particularly in children at
the early stages of speech development or those with language
impairments.
