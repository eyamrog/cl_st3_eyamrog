Mayors and councilors serve a significant informational function for state
legislators. Evidence from our interviews indicates that legislators allocate resources
in response to requests from municipalities and regularly consult with
mayors and councilors during negotiations concerning budget amendments. Legislators depend
on these local brokers to identify which benefits are most
valued by the population and to adjust resource distribution accordingly.
In the absence of support from brokers, legislators would encounter
greater challenges in effectively representing their constituents and shaping public
policy.
