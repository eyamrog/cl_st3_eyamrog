The mechanisms by which these feelings influence athletes, including their
timing and underlying causes, remain unclear and are characterized by
contradictory findings, with a noted lack of empirical evidence regarding
the timing and content of psychological skill application prior to
competition (Hagan et al., 2017a). For example, Vega Marcos et
al. (2008) assessed the mood state profiles of professional soccer
players using the POMS across four precompetition events during the
play-offs of a national championship and found no significant differences
in mood profiles between the beginning and end of the
championship phase, suggesting stability of mood states within the same
competitive period. In contrast, Torres-Luque et al. (2013) investigated the
relationship between training load, competition days, and mood states in
elite judo athletes during a competitive period, identifying effects of
both training load and competitive cycles on mood states, particularly
Fatigue; notably, their assessment extended to training sessions and was
not limited to competition days. Similarly, Box et al. (2018)
examined mood states over a consecutive 5-week CrossFitÂ® competition and
found that baseline and pre-workout mood did not differ significantly
across the competition period; however, negative moods such as Fatigue
increased immediately post-workout but returned to pre-workout levels during recovery,
while Vigor remained consistently elevated throughout each session.
