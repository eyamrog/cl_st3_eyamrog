The necropolitical policies implemented by Bolsonaro and Modi were characterized
by the adoption of an extreme interpretation of herd immunity
as a primary strategy, the suppression of information regarding infection
rates, and the covert enactment of measures that disproportionately increased
mortality among marginalized populations. These approaches persisted even during subsequent
periods marked by declining mortality rates, largely due to the
fragmented and inconsistent opposition from civil society, the media, and
other stakeholders. Assigning direct responsibility for the elevated mortality rates
to official necropolitical strategies was deemed politically unviable by many
centrist and right-wing politicians, including those who privately expressed concerns
about government actions, as such accusations would implicate the ruling
elite in the deliberate marginalization and devaluation of specific social
groups. Consequently, these politicians often preferred to describe the situation
as “mismanagement,” a term that allowed for a less confrontational
critique and facilitated the continued existence of necropolitical practices in
a more subtle and institutionalized manner.
