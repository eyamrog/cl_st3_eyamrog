As previously noted, these studies typically rely on the assumptions
of principal-agent models. To apply this framework, it is necessary
to clearly identify the principal and the agent in each
context (Gailmard, 2012, p. 4). Our analysis indicates that state
representatives and brokers do not occupy fixed roles; rather, their
positions shift over time and across different contexts, allowing them
to perform dual functions. For example, as principals, legislators act
as key decision-makers who expect local actors to support their
electoral objectives. To incentivize brokers, legislators may allocate discretionary budget
resources to municipalities and respond to requests from mayors and
councilors. In this capacity, legislators are also exposed to the
risks inherent in principal-agent relationships. However, because mayors and councilors
are themselves elected officials, temporal changes can result in legislators
becoming agents, mobilizing voters in support of municipal elections. Additionally,
a notable aspect often overlooked in existing analyses is that
representatives must mobilize voters to secure the political survival of
those who previously served as their brokers. Thus, the designation
of principal or agent is determined by the specific function
performed within the relationship, which varies over time and space
and cannot be solely inferred from formal positions within the
countryâ€™s elected office structure.
