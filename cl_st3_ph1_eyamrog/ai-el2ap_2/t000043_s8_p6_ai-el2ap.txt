The primary advantage of the self-controlled case series (SCCS) design
is its rigorous control of time-invariant confounders, such as sex,
geographic location, genetic factors, socioeconomic status, and underlying health conditions
(1,5,12). Additionally, data collection is more cost-effective and straightforward, as
the design requires only cases that have experienced the event
of interest. The SCCS design also offers methodological efficiency compared
to cohort studies; for instance, in post-vaccination adverse event surveillance,
traditional cohort studies may be impractical due to difficulties in
recruiting unvaccinated controls, as surveillance systems typically collect data only
from individuals who report adverse events. The SCCS design can
yield clinically and statistically valid results from a relatively small
sample size (1,4). However, the SCCS design has several limitations:
it provides estimates of relative incidence rather than absolute incidence;
it assumes that the probability of exposure is not influenced
by the occurrence of the outcome event; it requires the
effect of exposure to be transient; it does not adjust
for time-varying confounders; and it is susceptible to selection and
information bias, particularly when using data from surveillance databases. For
non-recurrent events, the SCCS design is appropriate only when the
event risk remains low throughout the observation period (1,12).
