The present study extends the investigation of athletes' Present Mood
States by evaluating these states not only immediately prior to
competition but also during training sessions, thereby enabling the analysis
of temporal changes in mood throughout a competitive period. Martini
(2000, p. 103) emphasized that psychological preparation in athletes should
be based on systematic interventions implemented according to a program
that accounts for the sequence of sporting events. The data
obtained in this study contribute to a more precise understanding
of the timing, nature, and extent of mood state changes,
thereby informing the planning and execution of interventions aimed at
optimizing athletes' preparation for competition. Consequently, it is essential to
incorporate the temporal dimension as a variable influencing models of
neuropsychological process variation (Staddon & Bueno, 1991), particularly in research
addressing subjective constructs such as Present Mood States in the
context of sport.
