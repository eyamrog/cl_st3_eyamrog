4. Experimentation. This category encompasses all the ways in which
the child engages with and manipulates available materials based on
a hypothesis that is subject to verification. The defining feature
of this category is the explicit verbalization of the hypothesis,
followed by the execution of actions intended to test it,
and the subsequent observation of the resulting effects. This pattern
of behavior aligns with Deweyâ€™s theory of the investigative process.
For instance, in one observation, Leonardo interacts with a pool
of water and states, "Look! This floats (indicating a piece
of wood), but if I put this on it (a
plastic bottle full of water), it will all go down,"
thereby articulating his hypothesis and testing it through direct experimentation.
