Most research examining the relationships between legislators and local leaders
primarily focuses on national representatives. However, studies by Castro, Anastasia,
and Nunes (2009) and Melo (2011) provide evidence of the
significance of local brokers for state representatives. Utilizing survey data
from twelve Brazilian states, these studies demonstrate that many state
legislators place considerable value on their connections with local leaders
and municipalities where they received substantial electoral support. These legislators
frequently visit localities, allocate resources from budget amendments to their
regions, respond to constituents' requests, and assist mayors in addressing
issues with government agencies. Furthermore, the studies indicate that a
substantial proportion of state legislators consider their ability to secure
resources for their constituencies as the most important factor for
their reelection.
