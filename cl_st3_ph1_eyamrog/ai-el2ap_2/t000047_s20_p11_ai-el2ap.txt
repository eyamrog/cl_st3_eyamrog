Among all the LLM domains, O-BT21 is the first in

The phrase "With New Oral-B 2-IN-1 Toothpaste" is pronounced to
emphasize the rationale for purchasing the product, specifically its effectiveness
in cleaning teeth each morning. During this statement, Social Actor
1 maintains direct eye contact with the target audience through
a vector gaze and accompanying hand gestures. The communication designer
further introduces a social actor who holds a teeth-shaped object,
illustrating how Oral-B contributes to dental strength and long-lasting fresh
breath. While holding the teeth-like object, the social actor turns
his head toward the viewer (sagittal orientation, nodding), thereby reinforcing
eye contact. Figure 6 presents shots of HLMA 3 (images).
