Our interviews indicate that the relationship between state legislators and
mayors is not characterized by a top-down dynamic in which
legislators unilaterally determine the allocation of benefits. Instead, local brokers
actively participate in this process. While legislators' offices sometimes initiate
the provision of benefits, the majority of requests originate from
the municipalities. These requests are frequent and occur throughout the
year, consistent with the findings of Bezerra (1999).
