The formal perspective identifies a theoretical domain, specifically a framework
that provides analysts with both the conceptualization and description of
a mode, thereby presenting the semiotic resource as professionally oriented.
It follows that the defining characteristics of a mode are
closely linked to history, culture, and science, as these three
domains collectively enhance the meaning potential of a communicative entity.
Consequently, a mode can be regarded as a unit of
analysis that facilitates the transfer of meaning between social actors.
These attributes contribute to the rationale for viewing multimodality as
an interdisciplinary field of inquiry, examined through the lens of
social semiotics.
