Of the total number of patients, 52.6% anticipated improved chewing
ability following the fabrication of their dentures. The final interview
scores for chewing ability demonstrated a mean of 9.9±0.5 for
complete upper dentures and 8.4±3.2 for complete lower dentures. Additionally,
the scores for chewing various types of foods support these
findings. These results indicate that dentures produced using the proposed
technique are capable of restoring chewing function to a degree
comparable to that achieved with conventional dentures, as previously reported.
