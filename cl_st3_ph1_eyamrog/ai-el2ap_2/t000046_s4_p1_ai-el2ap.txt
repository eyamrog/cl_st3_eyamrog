Teachers and administrators in a state school unit conceptualized health
primarily in terms of well-being, reflecting an expanded understanding that
moves beyond a strictly natural sciences-based perspective. Nevertheless, this understanding
appears to remain largely confined to the individual level, focusing
predominantly on students. The study further indicated that the prevailing
discourse continues to emphasize body practices as the primary connection
between physical education and health within the school context.
