The collected material was incorporated into the HCSTR collection, following
the acronym standard established by Thiers (2022), which is regularly
updated. Specimens were identified using specialized literature and verified by
expert examination. The floristic list was organized alphabetically by family
and species, with the circumscription of botanical families based on
the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group IV (APG IV 2016) classification. The
accuracy of scientific names was verified using the electronic databases
Flora do Brasil (BFG 2021) and Tropicos (http://www.tropicos.org).
