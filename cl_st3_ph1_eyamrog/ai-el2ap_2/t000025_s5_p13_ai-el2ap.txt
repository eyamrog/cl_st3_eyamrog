Wound-related pain is not confined to the wound bed and
may also affect the periwound skin. Malignant fungating wounds (MFWs)
are often associated with high levels of exudate, which can
irritate the periwound area and are characterized by inflammation, with
or without erosion, as well as symptoms such as itching,
pain, and potential skin damage secondary to infection (Tamai et
al., 2016b). To mitigate the effects of constant moisture, the
use of appropriate barrier products is recommended to protect the
periwound skin by repelling excess moisture and preventing subsequent damage
(LeBlanc et al., 2021). Nevertheless, there is a lack of
robust evidence regarding the effectiveness of these products in patients
with MFWs.
