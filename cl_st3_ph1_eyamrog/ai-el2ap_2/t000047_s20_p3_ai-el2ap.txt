Subsequently, a social actor (referred to as Social Actor 1),
dressed in a deep blue tie and a light blue
long-sleeve shirt, makes the following statement in a restroom setting:
"You clean your teeth every morning." This declarative clause, presented
in example 1a, is pronounced assertively and acknowledges the common
practice of daily tooth brushing. The use of the pronoun
"you" in the clause is generic, as it addresses all
viewers of the advertisement, thereby positioning the audience as the
intended recipients of the message. Consequently, the target audience for
the Oral-B advertisement is broadly defined as anyone who uses
toothpaste. The adjunct "every morning" specifies that tooth brushing is
a daily activity typically performed before breakfast or prior to
engaging in daily routines. Social Actor 1 reinforces the verbal
message with accompanying gestures, such as folding his fingers together
in a manner reminiscent of a boxer preparing for a
match, raising his hands slightly to chest level, and holding
a toothbrush in his right hand. He also makes a
forward (sagittal) movement with his head and uses his right
hand to emphasize the statement, "You clean your teeth every
morning." The combination of spoken language and gestural actions serves
as a demonstrative means of conveying conviction.
