Teachers’ and coordinators’ conceptualizations of health ranged from broad to
more limited perspectives, indicating that the topic is interpreted in
multiple ways. From a broad perspective, health is understood to
encompass social determinants and extends beyond the mere presence or
absence of disease. Conversely, the more restricted perspective confines health
to the physical dimension, equating it with not being ill
or not requiring medication, and sometimes aligns it with the
World Health Organization’s definition of complete physical, psychological, and social
well-being.
