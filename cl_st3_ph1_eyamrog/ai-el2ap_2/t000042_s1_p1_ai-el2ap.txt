This article utilizes Achille Mbembe’s concept of necropolitics to analyze
government responses to the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic
in Brazil and India, two middle-income countries that are infrequently
compared in the literature. The analysis focuses on the roles
of President Jair Bolsonaro and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in
shaping their respective national responses. Bolsonaro publicly dismissed medical guidance
and minimized the severity of COVID-19, referring to it as
a “little flu,” while Modi implemented formal measures such as
social distancing and a nationwide lockdown. Despite these contrasting approaches,
marginalized populations in both countries, including Black and Indigenous groups
in Brazil and Muslim minorities, marginalized Hindu castes, and migrant
workers in India, remained largely invisible in public discourse and
policy responses. The article contends that the differences between Brazil’s
and India’s responses were primarily quantitative rather than qualitative, as
both governments enacted necropolitical policies that rendered certain populations expendable.
While COVID-19-related deaths received significant international media coverage, the mortality
and suffering of disenfranchised groups in both countries were comparatively
neglected, reinforcing prevailing narratives that developing countries are inherently unable
to adequately protect vulnerable populations.
