3. Exploration. This category encompasses behaviors in which a child
not only detects and briefly observes a phenomenon but also
engages in actions that demonstrate an intention to gain a
deeper understanding of its functioning, often with the aim of
achieving a goal beyond mere cognitive curiosity. For example, Alice
attempts to obtain a piece of cellotape but is unable
to tear it. She increases the force applied and observes
that the tape stretches without tearing. She then attempts to
tear it with her teeth, hypothesizing that increased force or
the use of teeth might be effective, but this method
also fails. Subsequently, she returns the tape to the box
while still holding the cardboard roll, indicating the conclusion of
her exploratory attempt.
