In the category of “Mental health,” teacher Larissa identifies a
relationship between physical education (PE) and health that is grounded
in the development of coexistence within a heterogeneous student group.
She highlights the role of PE as a curricular component
that fosters socialization and supports diversity, while also acknowledging the
limitations noted by Bracht et al. (2003). Teacher Larissa’s discourse
further addresses the social realities of students, noting a significant
exposure to risky behaviors among certain groups. Similarly, Zappe and
Dell’anglio (2016) found that negative perceptions of relationships at school
and within the family, combined with poor academic performance, demotivation,
and dissatisfaction with school, contribute to behavioral changes and serve
as stressors that may compromise students’ mental health. Consequently, the
teacher underscores the diversity of student profiles within the school,
particularly emphasizing those who are more exposed to and at
greater risk of engaging in risky behaviors.
