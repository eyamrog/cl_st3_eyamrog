This type of evaluation requires careful and systematic observation to
differentiate between the abilities and skills the child has already
mastered and those currently being acquired. It is essential to
identify and reinforce these emerging competencies to inform educational choices
and interventions that support ongoing development. The teacher is responsible
for providing scaffolding, encouragement, and facilitation to promote balanced growth.
Evaluation procedures should take into account the children's everyday experiences
and guide teachers to focus on the learning process, assuming
responsibility for their instructional approaches and acknowledging both successes and
shortcomings. From this perspective, the purpose of educational evaluation is
to assess the developmental processes and progress demonstrated by the
children.
