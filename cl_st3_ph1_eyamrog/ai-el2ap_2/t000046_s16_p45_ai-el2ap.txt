According to Fabiana, a Physical Education (PE) teacher, it is
essential for teachers to convey to students an understanding of
movement and its significance. Through the teacher’s guidance on what
it means to move, students can comprehend the role of
PE in promoting health. The primary objective of PE is
to help students understand body movement and recognize the benefits
it can provide throughout their lives. PE also aims to
increase students’ awareness of their own bodies, emphasizing the importance
of bodily knowledge.
