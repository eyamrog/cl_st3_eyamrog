Considering the aforementioned information and drawing on the conception of
the school as a sociocultural space (Dayrell, 1996), characterized by
multiple perspectives on education and life, as well as a
space of sociability that, according to Gusm√£o (2003), is defined
by encounters and divergences, searches and losses, and processes of
discovery and concealment, the findings of this study reflect the
emergence of diverse perceptions regarding physical education within the school
context.
