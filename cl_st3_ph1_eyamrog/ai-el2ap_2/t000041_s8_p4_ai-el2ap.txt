In the Paraíba hinterland mesoregion, floristic studies conducted over the
past five years have enhanced knowledge of the state's flora
and contributed to a more comprehensive understanding of the flora
and vegetation in Caatinga areas (Lucena et al. 2015; Torres
et al. 2016; Brito et al. 2018; Costa et al.
2019; Fernando et al. 2021). The present study provides a
floristic survey of the ABA farm, located in the municipality
of Passagem, Paraíba State, in Northeast Brazil.
