Similar to the study conducted by Garcia and Infante (2012),
Ramos and Serrano (2013) implemented their investigation through a workshop
(extension course) designed for undergraduate students. The researchers interviewed undergraduate
chemistry students following activities that involved the use of molecular
modeling software. Consistent with the approach described by Scherr (2008),
the interviews aimed to explore the cognitive processes of the
students as they responded to the questions. Specifically, the researchers
sought to identify connections between the students' gestures and their
mental representations during the process of answering.
