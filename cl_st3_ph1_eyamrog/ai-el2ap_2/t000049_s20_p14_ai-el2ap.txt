Through observation and analysis of the children's experiences, the researcher
and supervisors identified several elements for further investigation, including the
duration for which children in the three groups exhibited scientific
attitudes and how they applied these attitudes to explore a
specific theme or observed phenomenon. Notably, groups A and B,
which were guided by an adult employing a "promotes from
within" approach, demonstrated sustained engagement with scientific attitudes, increasing from
37% during the first session to 42% in the final
session. In contrast, group C, where the adult neither emphasized
the children's interests nor actively facilitated the learning process, showed
a decline in the manifestation of scientific attitudes, decreasing from
24% in the first session to 12% in the last.
