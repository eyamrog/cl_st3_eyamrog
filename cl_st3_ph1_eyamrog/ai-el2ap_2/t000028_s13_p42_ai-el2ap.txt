The “Way to English/Way to Go!” website provides supplementary materials
for English language teachers, including flashcards, worksheets, tests, educational videos,
and songs, each clearly linked to the corresponding textbook, unit,
and content area. While songs and listening activities available on
the website may be suitable for use with blind students,
no materials specifically designed or adapted for this audience were
identified.
