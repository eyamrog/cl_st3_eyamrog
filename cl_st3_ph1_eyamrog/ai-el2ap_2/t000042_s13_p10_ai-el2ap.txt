The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted significant structural deficiencies in India’s health
and social welfare systems, including the lack of universal health
coverage and insufficient protection for economically disadvantaged populations. After the
first confirmed case of COVID-19 in India—a student returning from
Wuhan to Kerala—there were reported incidents of racial discrimination against
migrants from Northeast India, a region bordering China. Individuals from
this region were frequently stigmatized and falsely associated with the
transmission of the virus in major metropolitan areas such as
New Delhi, Pune, Mumbai, and Hyderabad. Additionally, the pandemic was
accompanied by an increase in Sinophobic and Islamophobic sentiments.
