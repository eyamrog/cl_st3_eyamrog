The prevalence of edentulism among Brazil’s indigenous population is high.
Rates of tooth loss and the need for dentures among
the Pataxó are greater than those observed in the general
Brazilian population. In the present study, dental caries and periodontal
disease were identified as the primary causes of tooth loss,
with these conditions being exacerbated by socioeconomic challenges faced by
indigenous communities and by the invasive nature of public dental
services.
