Nogueira (2009) and Silva (2013) reported high presence values in
locution with a greater correlation with Factor XI (Receptivity) among
midfielders following matches in which they were defeated. In contrast,
the present study did not identify significant differences between groups
for this PMSL Factor. This discrepancy may be attributed to
the characteristics of the current sample (U-15), in which players
exhibit less specialization in their field roles compared to the
adult categories analyzed in previous research. Nevertheless, Factor XI was
still observed after defeats, although its presence value was lower
than that recorded during matches.
