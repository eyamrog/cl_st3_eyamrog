The present study found that participants utilized a range of
medications to manage anxiety symptoms, with benzodiazepines (BZDs) being the
most frequently used, followed by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
and antidepressants (ADTs). The data reflect the medications most commonly
used by participants at the time of survey administration. For
the purposes of this study, anxiolytics are defined as all
psychotropic drugs classified as antidepressants, antipsychotics, BZDs, barbiturates, and other
sedative-hypnotic medications that are indicated for the treatment of mild
to severe anxiety symptoms (Morris et al., 2021).
