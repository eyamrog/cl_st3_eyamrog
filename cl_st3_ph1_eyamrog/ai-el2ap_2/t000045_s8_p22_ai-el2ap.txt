With few exceptions (Auyero, 2000; Lawson and Greene, 2011; Finan
and Schechter, 2012), the existing literature generally overlooks the significance
of friendship and the roles of gratitude, reciprocity, and obligation
in the dynamics of political brokerage. These factors can function
as mechanisms for establishing or maintaining relationships and may serve
to mitigate opportunistic or predatory behavior. In contrast, many studies
conceptualize these relationships primarily as market transactions, driven by instrumental
calculations (Brusco, Nazareno & Stokes, 2003; Stokes et al., 2013;
Zarazaga, 2014; Camp, 2015).
