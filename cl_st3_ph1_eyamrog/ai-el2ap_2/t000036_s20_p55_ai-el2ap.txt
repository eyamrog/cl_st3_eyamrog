In Chile, the labor code was enacted on May 13,
1931, establishing the regulation of minimum wages through a system
of negotiations conducted by commissions. One commission consisted of three
representatives from the workers' group, while another commission comprised three
representatives from the business and industrial sectors. These commissions were
responsible for determining the conditions of the minimum wage and
for resolving disputes, with the involvement of the General Labor
Inspector (Vergara, 2014).
