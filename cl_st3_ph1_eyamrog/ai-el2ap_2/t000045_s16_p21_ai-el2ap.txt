We observed that the demands made by councilors are more
diverse compared to those made by mayors, whose requests primarily
concern financial resources. Mayors are generally associated with requests of
a broader or more general nature, although they occasionally seek
assistance on behalf of specific groups or individuals. In contrast,
councilors predominantly advocate for the interests of individuals and social
organizations, which they refer to as “entidades.”
