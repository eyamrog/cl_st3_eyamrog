Entering university represents a significant developmental stage for many young
individuals, characterized by maturational changes at physiological, neurological, and psychological
levels during the transition from adolescence to adulthood (Silva &
Costa, 2012). This period often presents challenges, as students must
adapt to new social roles and adjust to changes across
multiple domains of university life (Ferreira et al., 2009; Pereira
& Ramos, 2021).
