In 2019, Huang, Kim, and Christianson from the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign reported that gestures can be beneficial for
vocabulary acquisition in a second language, provided that the gestures
are not easily confused with other target words and that
the number of words introduced is limited. Their study demonstrated
that presenting new vocabulary items alongside simultaneous gestures can enhance
students' recall of these words. The researchers discussed the dual
coding theory, which posits that learning is improved when verbal
information is paired with corresponding gestures, thereby facilitating the integration
of both modalities.
