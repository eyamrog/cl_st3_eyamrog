In multimodal discourse, a mode functions as a semiotic channel
for both artistic and scientific expression. The artistic aspect is
derived from specific cultural or contextual backgrounds, allowing the sign-maker
to construct meaning for a targeted audience. The scientific dimension
is based on the influence of individuals on an artifact
that is utilized as a mode. Additionally, the analytical value
attributed by an analyst to the materiality of a mode
further supports its scientific characterization. There is little doubt that
a mode possesses a material human component, while its conceptual
manifestation is heuristic, utilizing media to elicit contextually embedded meanings.
According to Constantinou (2005), this communicative framework serves not only
as a mechanism for meaning realization but also as an
abstract resource for semiosis (Fei, 2004). This perspective informs Norrisâ€™s
(2011) argument that modes are necessarily construed as distinct entities.
This distinctiveness underscores that every meaning-maker employs one or more
modes to communicate ideas across different contexts. Consequently, a mode
is positioned as an essential element of communication. As a
distinct subject, the mode highlights two key perspectives: first, that
different modes within a semiotic system make significant contributions to
meaning-making for readers; and second, that each mode produces clearly
identifiable meanings within specific contextual domains.
