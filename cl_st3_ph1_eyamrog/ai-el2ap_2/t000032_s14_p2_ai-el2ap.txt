To assess the athletes’ present mood states, the Present Mood
States List (PMSL) was utilized. The PMSL measures mood states
using 40 first-person statements, each representing a specific mood. Participants
rate the intensity of each statement on a 5-point Likert-type
scale positioned alongside each item. These 40 statements are grouped
into 12 factors, which consider both the hedonic value and
activation level of each item. For clarity in data description
and identification, previous authors who have applied the PMSL in
sports contexts (Picoli, 2016; Silva, 2017) have designated the following
factor labels based on representative statements: I—Humiliation/Anger, II—Fatigue, III—Hope, IV—Limerence/Empathy,
V—Physiological Response, VI—Repulsion, VII—Interest, VIII—Surprise, IX—Hunger, X—Disregard/Envy, XI—Receptivity, and XII—Serenity.
