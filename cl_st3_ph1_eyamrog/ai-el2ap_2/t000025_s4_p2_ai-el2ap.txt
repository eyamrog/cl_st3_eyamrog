Pain was not formally assessed in 68.5% of the studies.
Among the remaining studies, 22 reported the use of specific
pain assessment instruments, including the Visual Analogue Scale, the Numerical
Verbal Scale, the McGill Pain Questionnaire, and categorical assessments classifying
pain as none, mild, moderate, or severe.
