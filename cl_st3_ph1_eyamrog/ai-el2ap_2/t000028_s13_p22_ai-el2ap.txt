It is important to note that, although a resource room
was available for special educational services, there were no pedagogical
materials accessible to blind students that would allow them to
engage with the full curricular content, resulting in significant gaps
in their learning. As a result, the teacher was often
required to create improvised materials, frequently without financial support, in
order to meet the need for adapted resources that were
not provided by the school.
