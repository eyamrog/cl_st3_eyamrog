In the category of “Balance,” health is conceptualized primarily as
a physical phenomenon, reflecting a Cartesian perspective that emphasizes the
body and supports a limited understanding of health. Silva, Silva,
and Lüdorf (2015) found that the body, as a subject
within physical education classes, has not been systematically addressed; instead,
it is only sporadically introduced through topics such as health
practices and habits.
