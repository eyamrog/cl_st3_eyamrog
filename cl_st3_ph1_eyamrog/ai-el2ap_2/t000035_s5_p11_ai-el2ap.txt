Although the number of rehabilitated patients in this study was
limited, the statistical significance, large effect size, and innovative approach
support the validity and reliability of the findings. These results
are particularly relevant for informing public policies aimed at improving
access to rehabilitation services for isolated populations residing in remote
areas distant from major urban centers.
