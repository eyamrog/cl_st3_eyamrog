According to Ferreira, Oliveira, and Sampaio (2013), physical education classes
should engage the body not primarily as a means of
training, but as a way to overcome barriers and address
health promotion as a socially determined process. From this perspective,
the body is not regarded merely as an instrument, but
as an integral aspect of an individual's existence.
