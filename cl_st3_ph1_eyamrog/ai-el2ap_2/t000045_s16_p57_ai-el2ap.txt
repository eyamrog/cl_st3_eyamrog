I surveyed all municipalities in which votes were cast, irrespective
of whether they favored the opposition or the incumbent. Subsequently,
I presented to the representative a list of localities where
she received the highest number of votes, indicating her ranking
as the most voted, second most voted, and so forth
(Chief of Staff 6).
