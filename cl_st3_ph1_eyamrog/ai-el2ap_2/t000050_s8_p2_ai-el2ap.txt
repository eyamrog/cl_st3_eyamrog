The datasets analyzed in this study consist of sand fly
occurrence records from two locations: (i) the Suruwaha Indigenous Land
(SIL) in southern Amazonas, with data collected between 2012 and
2013, and (ii) the Wajãpi Indigenous Land (WIL) in Amapá,
with data collected between 2013 and 2014. Each dataset includes
metadata for individual sand fly specimens collected during fieldwork, comprising
41 Darwin Core Standard (DwC) terms for the Suruwaha dataset
and 39 for the Wajãpi dataset. All mandatory fields are
included and have been validated through screening in the FIOCRUZ
IPT. Additionally, metadata fields are accessible on the corresponding online
pages.
