Mood states of soccer players have been investigated using the
Present Mood States List (PMSL) (see Bueno & Souza, 2019,
for a review). Nogueira (2009) examined the mood state profiles
of youth soccer players according to their playing positions and
the phase of competition. The findings indicated that all athletes
exhibited a similar mood state profile immediately prior to the
match; however, differences were observed between pre- and post-match mood
states. Additionally, specific mood states were associated with different playing
positions, and the outcome of the match influenced post-match mood
states. Dias-Silva (2013) also identified a common mood state profile
among soccer players, as well as position-specific mood state profiles,
which were related to playersâ€™ behaviors during the match.
