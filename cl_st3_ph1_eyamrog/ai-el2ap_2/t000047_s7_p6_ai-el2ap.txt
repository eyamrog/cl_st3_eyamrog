The axiomatic nature of mode has influenced existing literature in
multimodal discourse, as seen in O’Toole’s (1994) work on comprehension,
Kress and van Leeuwen’s (2021) exploration of conceptualization, and Scollon’s
(1998, 2001) focus on interactional sensitivity, with Scollon also providing
an ethnographically distinct perspective. Halliday’s systemic functional linguistics serves as
the foundational framework for exemplifying mode as an agent of
meaning-making in communication. Constantinou (2005) examines the representation of modes
in media techniques, while Silvestre (2008) investigates the mapping of
emotion in multimodal messages. Additionally, Cambria, Arizzi, and Coccetta (2012),
van Leeuwen and Jewitt (2001), and Adami (2015a) analyze the
practical affordances of web tools, the construction of meaning in
social semiotic entities, and mechanisms of interactivity within website contexts.
The contributions of Ly and Jung (2015) and Holsanova (2016)
focus on the modal design of advertising systems and the
methodologies for exploring integrative elements of communication.
