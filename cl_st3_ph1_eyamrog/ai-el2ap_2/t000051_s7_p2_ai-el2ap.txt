The terms Zeitenwende, watershed, new reality, and new era all
suggest a lack of agency, implying that circumstances have changed
independently of human action. Unlike the term paradigm shift, which
indicates a change in perception or understanding, these terms convey
that conditions are now objectively different and that adaptation is
necessary. In the context of the German discourse on the
Russian invasion of Ukraine, this language appears to construct a
perspective in which the collective self is positioned as a
passive observer, compelled to respond to the abrupt loss of
previous certainties. Such discursive strategies, which exclude the self from
responsibility for the actions of an other with whom it
has been engaged, are problematic, particularly from a Bakhtinian dialogic
perspective, where the observer’s position is considered fundamental (Holquist, 2002,
p. 19). A central aim of critical discourse studies is
to analyze how dominant discourses maintain their influence and how
political actors employ them to legitimize their actions as inevitable.
Bakhtin’s concepts of dialogism and the interplay between centripetal and
centrifugal discourses provide valuable analytical frameworks for examining the competition
between discourses in the construction of political realities.
