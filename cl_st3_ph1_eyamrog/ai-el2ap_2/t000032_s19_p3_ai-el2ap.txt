A comparison of the values for each Factor across Series
indicated changes in mood states over time (Figure 2). Temporal
patterns were observed for Factor IV (Limerence/Empathy) and Factor VII
(Interest). Specifically, Factor IV (Limerence/Empathy) presence values were significantly higher
in Series 1 compared to Series 2 (p = 0.012).
Factor VII (Interest) presence values were also significantly higher in
Series 1 compared to Series 2 (p = 0.003) and
marginally higher compared to Series 3 (p = 0.055). These
results indicate that both Factor IV (Limerence/Empathy) and Factor VII
(Interest) were more prominent in Series 1 than in subsequent
Series.
