Dialogic contraction through pronouncement is employed to assert that Putin
initiated the war “aus einem einzigen Grund” (‘for a single
reason’), thereby rejecting the indivisible security discourse in favor of
a narrative that frames the conflict as “Putin’s war.” This
perspective characterizes the invasion as an unprovoked attack on the
free world by a potentially irrational individual who seeks “ein
unabhängiges Land von der Weltkarte tilgen” (‘to wipe an independent
country off the map’).
