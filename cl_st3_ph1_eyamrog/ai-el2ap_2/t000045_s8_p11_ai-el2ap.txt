Several characteristics of the Brazilian political system, including its federal
structure, electoral system, delineation of electoral districts, separate timing of
elections, and the centralization of resources, promote cooperation among political
actors at the local, state, and national levels during both
electoral and non-electoral periods (Carneiro and Almeida, 2008). Existing research
in electoral and legislative studies provides evidence that the relationships
between local leaders and elected representatives constitute a fundamental aspect
of Brazilian politics.
