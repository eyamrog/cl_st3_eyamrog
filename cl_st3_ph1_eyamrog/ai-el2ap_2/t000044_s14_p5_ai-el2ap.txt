Following the approach of Pereira et al. (2019), we implemented
a two-phase process for the inclusion or exclusion of articles
during the literature review. In the first phase, we screened
the articles by reviewing their titles, abstracts, and keywords based
on predefined criteria. In the second phase, we conducted a
full-text review of the articles selected in the initial screening
and subsequently classified them according to their relevance and thematic
similarities.
