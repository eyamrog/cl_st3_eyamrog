Data on the economically active population in Ecuador during the
1930s are limited due to the absence of systematic data
collection or national censuses conducted by the central government during
that period. Consequently, available figures are estimates derived from local
projections rather than comprehensive national statistics. According to calculations by
the National Economic Planning and Coordination Board, approximately 32% of
the population was considered economically active by 1962.
