This study employs a qualitative research approach, which is grounded
in an interpretivist philosophical position that focuses on how the
social world is interpreted, understood, experienced, produced, or constituted, and
relies on data generation methods that are flexible and sensitive
to the social context in which data are produced (Mason,
2002, p. 3). Within this framework, the researcher is not,
and cannot be, neutral, objective, or detached from the knowledge
and evidence being generated (Mason, 2002, p. 7).
