This phase involved performing proservation, as well as basal and
occlusal adjustments, and evaluating the prosthetic services provided. Indigenous participants
who received prosthetic treatment attended up to four post-installation control
and adjustment sessions, continuing until they reported satisfactory comfort with
denture use. All adjustments were conducted by the village dentist
in collaboration with a faculty member from Faculdade SÃ£o Leopoldo
Mandic.
