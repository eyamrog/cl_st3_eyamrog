Moreover, the statements of the participants in this category indicate
two distinct understandings of the theme: one aligns with the
concept of the body culture of movement, as described by
Oliveira, Martins, and Bracht (2015a), and is reflected in coordinator
Sofiaâ€™s perspective, which encompasses games, sports, and playfulness; the other
adopts a more limited view, focusing primarily on sport, as
mentioned by Nara, a Portuguese language teacher. These differing perspectives,
along with additional contributing factors, illustrate the complexity of the
relationship between physical education and health in schools, which in
turn influences whether pedagogical practices adhere to traditional models or
are more receptive to critical pedagogical approaches.
