The terms "system" and "system network" are central to this
discussion. According to Butler (1985), a system is defined as
an enumerated set of choices within a specific environment, consisting
of items that have possible alternatives relevant to their function.
In this context, a system enables the selection of a
particular mode for accomplishing a specific task (Kress, 1981; Dalamu
& Ogunlusi, 2020). A system network, on the other hand,
is a representation that illustrates the available choices in communicative
activities and is regarded as a significant innovation in Hallidayan
linguistics. Halliday and Matthiessen (2014) describe a system network as
the range of options accessible to a communicator. The system
network facilitates the analysis of the overall organization of semiotic
resources by providing a structured overview of the optional variables
present in textual resources.
