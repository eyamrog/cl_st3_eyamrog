A previous systematic review evaluated the efficacy of topical treatments
for malignant fungating wounds (MFW) in managing local infection, odor,
and pain. The review included four studies: three randomized controlled
trials and one pre- and post-test survey focused on odor
and infection management. The authors concluded that additional intervention studies
are needed to address the control of MFW-related pain (Finlayson
et al., 2017a).
