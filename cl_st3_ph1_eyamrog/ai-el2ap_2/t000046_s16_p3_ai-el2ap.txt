The study included 13 volunteers who met the following inclusion
criteria: employment as a full-time professional at the REESP for
a minimum of one year and assignment to the surveyed
school unit for at least one year. Participants who provided
insufficient data for analysis would have been excluded; however, this
situation did not arise. To ensure a comprehensive representation of
perspectives on the research topic, the sample was designed to
include at least one teacher from each subject area, as
well as the physical education teacher and the school manager.
