The fifth discourse identified is the indivisible security discourse (example
2), which is evident through the use of indirect reported
speech (“redet von”). This linguistic choice briefly introduces the security
guarantees that Russia has requested, referencing the principle of indivisible
security established by OSCE member states in the Helsinki Final
Act and reaffirmed in the Paris Charter. However, Scholz does
not explicitly mention these treaties; instead, he frames Putin’s demand
in a vague, ambiguous, and personalized manner through the use
of “reden von.” This rhetorical strategy not only undermines the
legitimacy of the demand but also situates the discourse within
the context of proximal already-spoken statements, rather than referencing more
authoritative distal already-spoken sources. The passage employs dialogic expansion by
creating distance, followed by a combination of countering and pronouncement
through the phrase “Tatsächlich aber,” which serves to imply that
Putin is being untruthful and that Scholz is aware of
the actual underlying intentions.
