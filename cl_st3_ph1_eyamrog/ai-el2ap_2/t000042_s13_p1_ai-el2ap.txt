On February 26, 2020, the first case of COVID-19 in
SÃ£o Paulo was reported in a 61-year-old man who had
recently returned from Italy. Additional cases were confirmed by the
end of the month. On March 7, President Bolsonaro visited
the United States and attended a dinner with President Trump
in Palm Beach, Florida; subsequently, more than twenty members of
his delegation tested positive for COVID-19, but Bolsonaro did not
self-isolate. By late March, all 27 Brazilian states had reported
cases, with 2,000 individuals testing positive and 80 deaths recorded
nationwide. On March 18, the Brazilian Association of Collective Health
(ABRASCO) called for targeted support for favelas, including waivers for
utility bills, distribution of food and hygiene kits, public health
campaigns promoting hand-washing and mask use, and the implementation of
a Test, Trace, and Isolate (TTI) program. Despite these recommendations,
President Bolsonaro publicly minimized the severity of the pandemic, dismissed
medical advice, criticized mask usage, and encouraged the population to
return to work, framing the response as a choice between
public health and economic stability. He argued that lockdowns would
have more detrimental effects than the virus itself, citing potential
increases in unemployment, food insecurity, domestic violence, and suicide. Although
most local authorities expressed willingness to adopt measures similar to
European lockdowns, federal government pressure resulted in only limited restrictions
being implemented. In April, as the World Health Organization reported
over one million COVID-19 cases globally, Bolsonaro advocated for a
"vertical" quarantine strategy, isolating only high-risk groups such as the
elderly and individuals with comorbidities, and presented this approach as
distinct from stricter European lockdowns and as a pathway to
herd immunity. This strategy was widely criticized by the National
Council of State Health Secretaries, professional organizations, and former Ministers
of Health, who described "vertical" isolation as irresponsible and an
example of "medical populism," characterized by the rejection of established
scientific evidence and the politicization of the health crisis to
maintain political support for the federal government.
