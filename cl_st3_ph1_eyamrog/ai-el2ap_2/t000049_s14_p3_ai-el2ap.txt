One of the primary objectives of this research, in line
with previous studies, was to identify the most effective environment
for facilitating scientific observation and analysis of natural behaviors in
preschool-aged children, specifically those attending kindergarten. The study also examines
the influence of teachers' educational styles on the learning environment,
recognizing their significant impact as an environmental factor. Additionally, a
secondary objective was to determine whether, and to what extent,
children of the same age group (4- and 5-year-olds) within
the same educational context, who were given equal opportunities for
free experimentation with ‘stimulating tools,’ demonstrated similar skill sets and
scientific attitudes after being exposed to different teaching styles.
