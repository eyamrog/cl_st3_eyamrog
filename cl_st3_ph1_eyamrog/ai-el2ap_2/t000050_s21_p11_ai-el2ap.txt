These data are significant as they document the distribution of
sand flies collected from various sites within two indigenous territories
in the Brazilian Amazon. The dataset is relevant to multiple
stakeholders, including academia, government agencies, civil society, and non-governmental organizations.
Notably, the data have the potential to facilitate the integration
of scientific and indigenous knowledge, thereby supporting the development and
adaptation of health surveillance activities to diverse eco-social contexts with
the active involvement of indigenous communities, who possess detailed knowledge
of their territories.
