The results indicate a two-factor structure of the CPDI (Qiu
et al., 2020), which aligns with the conceptualization of stress
as a physiological or psychological response to internal or external
stressors (VandenBos, 2015). The first factor, internal stressors (items 1,
4, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
20, 23, and 24), encompasses symptoms such as palpitations, sweating,
dry mouth, shortness of breath, fidgeting, accelerated speech, increased negative
emotions, and prolonged stress fatigue (VandenBos, 2015). The second factor,
external stressors (items 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, and
22), refers to events, forces, or conditions that elicit physical
or emotional stress (VandenBos, 2015). It may be necessary to
revise items 5, 6, and 21 to improve their alignment
with the identified factors. Given that these findings are preliminary,
additional studies are required to further assess the validity and
reliability of the proposed structure.
