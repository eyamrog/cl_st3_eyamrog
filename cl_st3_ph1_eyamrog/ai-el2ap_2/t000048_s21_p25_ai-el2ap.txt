Hedychium coccineum may be confused with H. gardnerianum Sheph. ex
Ker Gawl. in herbarium specimens, as both species exhibit yellowish
to brownish flowers. However, they can be distinguished by the
width of the leaf blade, which measures 2.5–4.5 cm in
H. coccineum and 4–12 cm in H. gardnerianum, as well
as by the morphology of the labellum; H. coccineum has
a deeply divided labellum, whereas H. gardnerianum is characterized by
a division at the apex (based on specimens P. Feliz
178, Souza V.C. 2145, and S.L. Marçon 43).
