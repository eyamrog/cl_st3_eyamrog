During the 1990s, several significant international developments advanced the rights
of individuals with disabilities. The World Declaration on Education for
All affirmed that every individual is entitled to education and
should have access to fundamental learning conditions (UNESCO, 1990). In
1994, the United Nations introduced the Salamanca Statement, which emphasized
the importance of social and educational inclusion by asserting that
individuals with special needs are entitled to equal educational opportunities,
irrespective of any disabilities (Figueiredo & Kato, 2015).
