Several topical therapies and treatments are available for pain management
in patients with malignant fungating wounds (MFWs). These include non-adherent
dressings, hydrogel and hydrocolloid dressings, topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
topical opioids, and local anesthetics. Additionally, antimicrobial dressings containing silver
or honey may be used to reduce infection and associated
pain. The selection of a specific topical therapy depends on
factors such as wound characteristics, the severity of pain, patient
preferences, and the presence of infection or exudate. Current evidence
suggests that a multimodal approach, tailored to individual patient needs,
is most effective in managing pain associated with MFWs.
