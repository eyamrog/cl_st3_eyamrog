Another limitation of this study is the sample composition, which
consisted predominantly of women. To address this issue in future
research, efforts should be made to achieve a more balanced
gender distribution, potentially through the use of stratified or quota
sampling methods. Additionally, the use of convenience sampling led to
a higher proportion of participants from the state of Sergipe,
limiting the representativeness of the findings for the broader Brazilian
population. Consequently, the generalizability of the results should be interpreted
with caution. Future studies are recommended to replicate this research
while addressing these sampling limitations.
