In 2017, Aizawa, Giordan, and Silva conducted a study involving
graduate students during their mandatory undergraduate internships. The researchers employed
the Video-Stimulated Remembrance technique, in which students were recorded while
teaching and subsequently analyzed their own gestures using Kendon's (2004)
categorization framework. The findings indicate that the participants developed both
gestural and multimodal awareness, becoming more conscious of their verbal
communication as well as the positioning of their bodies and
hands, with the aim of modifying their actions in the
future to enhance meaning-making (Aizawa, Giordan, & Silva, 2017).
