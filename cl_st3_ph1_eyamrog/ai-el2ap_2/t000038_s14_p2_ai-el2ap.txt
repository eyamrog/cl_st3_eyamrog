Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted using a polychoric correlation
matrix and the Robust Diagonally Weighted Least Squares (RDWLS) extraction
method, which is recommended when the univariate distributions of ordinal
items are asymmetric (Asparouhov & Muth√©n, 2010). Dimensionality was assessed
using Parallel Analysis with random permutation, which is considered a
more accurate approach for this purpose. The determination of the
number of factors was based on the percentage of common
explained variance, following the guidelines of Timmerman and Lorenzo-Seva (2011).
For factor rotation, the Robust Promin method was applied as
described by Ferrando and Lorenzo-Seva (2018).
