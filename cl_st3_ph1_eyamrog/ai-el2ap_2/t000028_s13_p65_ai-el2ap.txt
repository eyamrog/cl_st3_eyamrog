In addition to group exercises, the EAL teacher can utilize
tactile resources to develop inclusive instructional activities. Uliana (2013) demonstrates
that the use of concrete materials, such as those included
in a pedagogical kit, plays a significant role in the
learning process of blind students by enabling them to access
educational content on an equal basis with sighted peers. The
topic of numbers (see Image 6) also presents valuable opportunities
for exploration using these tactile resources.
