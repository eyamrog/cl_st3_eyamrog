The data indicate that when the adult engaged in more
direct interventions—such as demonstrating actions instead of considering children's suggestions
and providing direct answers to their questions—there was a reduction
in the time children spent on scientific activities, in the
communication of scientific attitudes, and in their willingness to interact
within the group. These findings support previous assertions regarding the
effects of the "promotion from within" approach. Specifically, when activities
did not align with the children's interests, the adult effectively
replaced the children's role in the learning process, thereby hindering
their opportunities to interact, formulate hypotheses, test them, and share
findings with peers. In environments where the adult did not
attend to or incorporate children's curiosities, children exhibited difficulties both
in demonstrating scientific attitudes and in managing group interactions. As
a result, the researcher was required to intervene repeatedly to
maintain a conducive environment for the continuation of activities. Notably,
such issues were absent in the other two groups, which
adhered to the promotion from within approach.
