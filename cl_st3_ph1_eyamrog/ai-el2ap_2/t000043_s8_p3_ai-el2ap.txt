Information from previous events is often used to define the
risk period for adverse events following vaccination (1). For instance,
in studies of influenza vaccines and the subsequent development of
Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS), a prespecified risk period of 42 days
post-vaccination is commonly employed. This duration was established following a
cluster of GBS cases in the United States in 1976,
which occurred after administration of the A/New Jersey influenza vaccine
(10). Within this risk period, individuals who have received the
vaccine are considered to be at an increased risk of
developing GBS, while the time following this period is designated
as the control period (1,11).
