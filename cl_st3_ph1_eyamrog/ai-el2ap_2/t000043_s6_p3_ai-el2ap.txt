In this initial version of the tool, quality scores are
recommended; however, no weighting has been assigned to individual items
within the evaluated domains. This approach permits flexibility in the
evaluation process according to the specific requirements of the evidence
synthesis being conducted. It is important to note that quality
scores have previously been criticized for their limited ability to
predict the overall quality of a study, particularly when used
as a factor in the conduct of meta-analyses (26,27).
