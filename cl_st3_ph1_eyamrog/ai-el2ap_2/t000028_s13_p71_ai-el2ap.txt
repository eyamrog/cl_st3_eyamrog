In addition to group and tactile activities, the EAL teacher
may incorporate sound-based exercises or songs to emphasize the role
of orality in the classroom, specifically the practical application of
oral genres across various contexts. Camargo and Nardi (2006) observed
that prospective teachers also utilized orality by proposing activities such
as oral presentations and theatrical performances to address challenges encountered
when teaching Physics to blind students.
