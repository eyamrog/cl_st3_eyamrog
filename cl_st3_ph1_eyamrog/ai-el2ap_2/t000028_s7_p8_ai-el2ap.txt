Since 2000, additional laws and decrees have been enacted in
Brazil, notably the National Guidelines for Special Education in Basic
Education (Diretrizes Nacionais para Educação Especial na Educação Básica) and
the National Special Education Policy from the Perspective of Inclusive
Education (Política Nacional de Educação Especial da Perspectiva da Educação
Inclusiva). The National Special Education Policy ensures the right of
students with disabilities to access public education, while the National
Guidelines for Special Education in Basic Education are intended to
operationalize this democratization by promoting accessibility and inclusion for all
students (Alves, 2017).
