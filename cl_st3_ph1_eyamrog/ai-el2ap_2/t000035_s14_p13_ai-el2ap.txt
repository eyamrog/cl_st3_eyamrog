The objective of the initiative was to provide dental denture
services. During the joint venture, a team of dentists from
DSEI Bahia, supported by two prosthetic technicians and supervised by
faculty from Faculdade São Leopoldo Mandic, fabricated dental dentures for
members of the Pataxó community. A total of twenty edentulous
patients were rehabilitated with complete dentures. The dentures provided to
the patients were manufactured using pressed, thermally activated acrylic resin.
