The placement of the Oral-B logo in the upper right
corner of the LLM spheres and other prominent locations serves
two specific functions: first, it establishes Oral-B as the central
focus of the advertisement; second, it is intended to reinforce
brand recognition in the viewers’ cognitive processes. Close analysis indicates
that Social Actors 1 and 2 are portrayed by the
same individual, performing two distinct roles, a strategy facilitated by
computer-mediated design. This dual role assignment appears to be a
deliberate design choice. The representation establishes a parallel between the
actor and the Oral-B product, both embodying the concept of
"2-IN-1." This aligns with Williamson’s (2002) notion of the interchangeability
of semiotic resources. Additionally, the simultaneous presence of both a
toothbrush and toothpaste, which are typically consumed together, further reinforces
the 2-IN-1 characteristic.
