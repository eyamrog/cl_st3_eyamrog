Although cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) plays a significant role in
daily oral and maxillofacial practice, it is limited to visualizing
the mandibular canal (MC) rather than the nerve itself. Nevertheless,
CBCT remains the most effective imaging modality for preoperative radiographic
planning, including procedures such as implant placement and surgical extraction
of third molars. Accurate delineation of the MC using CBCT
can assist surgeons in minimizing the risk of intraoperative complications.
