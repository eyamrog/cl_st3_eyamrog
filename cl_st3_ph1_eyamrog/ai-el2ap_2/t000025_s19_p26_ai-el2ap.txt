The technique of dressing application and removal for managing MFW-related
pain was not classified as a topical therapy in this
review. Nonetheless, several studies referenced different dressing application methods and
conditions and their impact on pain outcomes. Twenty-one studies (30%)
recommended specific procedures related to dressing technique aimed at minimizing
pain. These studies comprised non-systematic reviews (66%), guidelines (14%), randomized
clinical trials (10%), a case study (5%), and a survey
(5%). Common recommendations included cleaning the wound with a solution
at an appropriate temperature, careful application and removal of dressings,
avoidance of debridement due to the risk of bleeding, maintenance
of a moist wound environment, use of soap with an
appropriate pH, reduction in the frequency of dressing changes, and
administration of analgesia prior to dressing application.
