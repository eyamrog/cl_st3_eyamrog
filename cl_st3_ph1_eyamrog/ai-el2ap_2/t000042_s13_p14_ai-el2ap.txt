Stringent measures to control COVID-19 in India resulted in significant
human costs. The closure of businesses and construction sites in
urban areas left an estimated 100 million migrant laborers, many
of whom resided at their workplaces, without income or access
to a social safety net, thereby limiting their ability to
purchase food. In response, many migrant workers undertook long journeys
on foot to return to their home regions. For example,
thousands of migrants from New Delhi attempted to walk along
interstate highways to their hometowns, located hundreds of miles away,
but were subjected to police violence shortly after beginning their
journeys. On March 29, 2020, all of India’s twenty-eight state
governments, except Uttar Pradesh, complied with a federal directive to
seal state borders, effectively preventing further movement of migrants. By
late March, official rhetoric increasingly characterized migrant workers as “reckless”
and as potential “virus spreaders.” The government only began repatriating
migrant workers in May 2020, utilizing the state-owned railway network;
however, virus control measures were inadequately implemented during these train
journeys, with limited testing and minimal social distancing, despite trips
lasting several days. Similarly, destination states enacted few protective measures
for returning migrants. Consequently, the mass movement of migrant workers
contributed to the spread of COVID-19 in rural areas. The
logistical and public health challenges associated with transporting migrant workers
were frequently neglected, and in some cases, authorities justified these
conditions by suggesting they might facilitate herd immunity. On June
1, 2020, the central government issued guidelines to relax restrictions
on inter-state travel, even though not all states agreed to
these changes. This policy persisted despite India recording the highest
number of new COVID-19 cases globally by September 2020, with
1.33 million new cases, surpassing Brazil and ranking second only
to the United States. Nevertheless, during the latter half of
2020, the Indian government asserted that the lockdown had resulted
in victory over the virus.
