The process of selecting brokers and maintaining relationships is characterized
by considerable diversity and dynamism. Analysis of interview data indicates
at least three distinct patterns. First, some historical partners demonstrate
long-term loyalty, often attributed to previous collaborative efforts and personal
connections. In such cases, partnerships may persist even when legislators
are dissatisfied with the number of votes obtained in a
municipality or when the requests of mayors have not been
fully addressed. Second, there are short-term, circumstantial partnerships that are
frequently dissolved due to perceived lack of commitment from one
party or changes in the local political environment. The absence
of strong ties—such as regional connections, friendships, shared affinities, or
common past experiences—reduces the costs associated with ending these relationships
and facilitates the search for new allies. In these instances,
short-term assessments of fulfilled requests and delivered votes are particularly
influential. Third, there are uncertain partners, such as mayors or
local councilors who have received benefits but about whom legislators
remain uncertain. These alliances are typically excluded from advisors’ calculations
of expected votes and are considered as potential, but not
guaranteed, sources of support.
