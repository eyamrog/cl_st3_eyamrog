Regarding the legal framework governing labor issues, several provisions addressing
workers' conditions were established during the 1930s. The first relevant
regulation was included in the Penal Code of 1906, which
remained in effect throughout the 1930s and prescribed imprisonment for
individuals who reduced workers' wages (Article 298). Subsequently, on September
11, 1916, legislation was enacted to regulate working hours and
days, setting the standard at eight hours per day and
six days per week (Albornoz 1931:52). In 1921, a law
was introduced to provide pecuniary compensation to workers or day
laborers in the event of work-related accidents. Additionally, the Social
Welfare and Labor Section was established on July 13, 1925,
and formally created on July 13, 1926.
