Anxiety can be conceptualized in two distinct forms: trait anxiety
and state anxiety. Within the university context, trait anxiety is
defined as a stable personality characteristic that predisposes students to
interpret the academic environment as threatening or dangerous, often resulting
in anxiety levels that are disproportionate to the actual situation
(Machado et al., 2016; Balapala & Indla, 2017). In contrast,
state anxiety refers to a temporary emotional condition characterized by
symptoms such as nervousness, worry, and apprehension, which are typically
associated with specific situations or stimuli encountered in the university
setting (Machado et al., 2016; Gama et al., 2021).
