In addition, the inclusion of blind students in classroom settings
remains a significant challenge, as noted by several studies (Camargo
& Nardi, 2006; Uliana, 2013; Oliveira & Reily, 2014; Ferreira
& Dickman, 2015). Ferreira and Dickman (2015) argue that while
the theoretical framework for the inclusion of blind individuals is
well established, practical implementation in educational environments is still problematic.
Their research investigates the contribution of the oral history methodology
to understanding the experiences of blind students in learning Physics.
The oral history method involves collecting and analyzing personal narratives
from individuals who are often underrepresented, with the aim of
gaining deeper insight into their prior experiences and identifying persistent
barriers. This approach allows blind students to articulate their interactions
with various instructional materials and teaching strategies, thereby providing educators
with direct feedback on which methods may be effective or
ineffective for their learning. The findings of Ferreira and Dickman
(2015) indicate that the oral history methodology is a promising
approach for addressing the challenges associated with the inclusion of
blind students in classroom contexts.
