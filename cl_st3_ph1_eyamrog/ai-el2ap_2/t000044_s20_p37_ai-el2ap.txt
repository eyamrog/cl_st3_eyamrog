Gestures can be effectively utilized in educational settings and, according
to Goldin-Meadow (2017), they can serve at least three distinct
functions. First, teachers should critically assess their own gestures to
ensure that they do not unintentionally convey concepts that could
mislead students. Additionally, teachers may consider how the content they
intend to teach can be represented through hand movements and
deliberately incorporate these gestures during instruction.
