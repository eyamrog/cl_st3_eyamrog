Only three studies (4%) investigated the use of topical antiseptics,
including Polyhexamethylene Biguanide, Octenidine, and other unspecified degerming agents, for
the management of pain associated with malignant fungating wounds (MFW).
The study designs comprised randomized clinical trials (66.6%) and non-systematic
reviews (33.4%). In all cases, pain control was not the
primary outcome; rather, the studies focused on the management of
general symptoms, with pain included as a secondary measure. Collectively,
the three studies evaluated 54 patients, predominantly women aged between
24 and 92 years, most of whom had primary tumors,
primarily of the breast. Pain assessment methods included verbal classification
and visual analog scales in two of the studies. The
application of topical antiseptics was associated with pain improvement in
two studies, while one study reported no change in pain
intensity scores (see Table 9).
