University students in health-related fields encounter specific challenges during their
academic training that may adversely impact their physical and mental
health (Carli et al., 2022). These challenges include extensive teaching
hours, a high volume of academic assignments, and mandatory internships
in hospital and primary care environments, where students are frequently
exposed to stressful situations associated with illness and the process
of patient care (Chattu et al., 2020).
