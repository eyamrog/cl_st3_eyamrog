As previously noted, the literature on electoral mobilization through brokers
identifies a range of indicators and metrics employed by voters,
candidates, politicians, and brokers to evaluate and monitor behavior within
mediation processes. The prevailing assumption in the literature, supported by
evidence presented in the preceding section, is that alliances between
local leaders and state representatives can yield mutual benefits. Conversely,
analyses grounded in principal-agent theory underscore the necessity of monitoring
brokers and providing them with private incentives (Camp, 2015) to
reduce agency losses. Such analyses highlight the importance for parties
to accurately assess when it is advantageous to maintain or
terminate these relationships, as well as to determine the appropriate
allocation of energy, time, and resources. In this context, the
central question is how state representatives assess the outcomes of
partnerships with local leaders and evaluate the potential for electoral
gains.
