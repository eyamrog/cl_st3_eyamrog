HLMA2 depicts the merging of two Oral-B cartons into a
single unit to represent a unified purpose between Social Actor
1 and Social Actor 2. This visual arrangement prompts Social
Actor 1 to direct their gaze toward the target audience,
thereby encouraging engagement and cooperation. Additionally, one social actor is
shown touching an image resembling teeth, which serves to associate
Oral-B toothpaste with the strengthening of teeth.
