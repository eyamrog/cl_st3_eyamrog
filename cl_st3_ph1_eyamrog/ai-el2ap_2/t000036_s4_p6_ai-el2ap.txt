In summary, it can be assumed that the labor legal
systems were fully or nearly fully applied to workers in
the public sector and in the largest industrial sectors of
the country. However, there are no available studies that have
examined the labor conditions in other sectors of the population
with respect to the implementation of these legal frameworks. This
lack of analysis is likely attributable to the prevalence of
informal labor arrangements and the fact that a significant proportion
of the economically active population participated in barter systems or
worked in contexts where compensation was provided partially or entirely
in kind.
