Eleven studies (15.7%) addressed therapies for pain management in the
periwound skin area. The study designs included non-systematic reviews (63.7%),
case studies (18.1%), guidelines (9.1%), and surveys (9.1%). The therapies
evaluated comprised zinc oxide (ointment and cream), silicone, dimethicone, petrolatum,
acrylate and cyanoacrylate, hydrocolloid (paste and powder), and vitamin-rich ointments
(A and D), all of which were components of pain-control
protocols. All studies were led by nurses and published in
journals focused on wounds, palliative care, oncology, and general nursing.
Two studies reported the assessment of pain, with one utilizing
a Visual Analog Scale as the measurement instrument. While positive
outcomes were noted, these results were not described in detail
(Table 11).
