If local brokers, particularly mayors, significantly contribute to a legislator’s
electoral success, it would be reasonable to expect that they
would also be held at least partially accountable for electoral
defeats. Among the individuals interviewed for this study, two had
worked for representatives who were not reelected. When asked about
the causes of these electoral losses, these interviewees, while expressing
dissatisfaction with the mayors’ effectiveness as electoral brokers, attributed greater
importance to other factors. Specifically, they highlighted the office’s challenges
in independently reaching voters through new technologies, such as social
media. This suggests a recognition of the increasing necessity for
representatives to establish direct communication with constituents and to reduce
reliance on intermediaries in order to receive acknowledgment for their
actions.
