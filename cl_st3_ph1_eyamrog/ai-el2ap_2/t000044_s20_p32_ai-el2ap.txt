Eighty-nine students from the University of International Studies in Xi'an,
China, participated in a study designed to investigate whether the
use of tuning gestures can enhance the learning of prosody,
which refers to the aspects of speech such as accent
and intonation. Yuan, Gonz√°lez-Fuente, Baills, and Prieto (2019) divided the
participants into two equivalent groups: a control group, which received
intonation training without tuning gestures, and an experimental group, which
received the same training supplemented with tuning gestures that represented
nuclear intonation contours. The results indicate that the experimental group
demonstrated significantly greater improvement in prosody learning. Furthermore, while participants
with stronger musical skills achieved higher overall results, those with
weaker musical skills showed greater relative benefit from observing the
gestures.
