For the second year, I have been teaching cytology, which
includes the study of the chemical composition of living organisms.
In this context, I attempt to integrate health-related topics into
my teaching, and I am aware that the physical education
(PE) teacher also addresses some aspects of health. I believe
that PE is relevant not only to physical health but
also to mental health, as it provides opportunities for students
to develop social skills and interact with peers. Our student
group is heterogeneous, as the state school admits students from
diverse backgrounds. Some students receive strong family support and supervision,
while others experience a lack of attention and guidance at
home. Therefore, I consider PE to be valuable for both
its contributions to physical development—such as nutrition and body formation—and
its role in fostering social interaction and coexistence among students.
