Based on this classification, we define: 1) "no visual impairment"
as mild vision loss or near-normal vision, characterized by the
ability to perceive light; 2) "moderate visual impairment" as moderate
low vision, with continued light perception; 3) "severe visual impairment"
as significant low vision, with minimal light perception; and 4)
"blindness" as profound to total visual impairment, characterized by little
or no light perception. Therefore, blindness is considered a form
of visual impairment, representing the most severe category within this
classification.
