The prominence assigned to brokers who hold elective office, as
opposed to local supporters of other representatives, indicates the importance
of further examining this specific category of broker and their
role within these relationships. Elected officials, such as mayors and
councilors, are subject to oversight and control by their superiors
during certain periods, while at other times, when acting as
superiors themselves, they request resources such as pork barrel budget
amendments and electoral support. This pattern of resource demand differs
from the types of rewards typically identified for brokers in
the existing literature. Although some scholars acknowledge the diversity of
broker types (Aspinall, 2014; Holland & Palmer-Rubin, 2015; Mares &
Young, 2016), they often overlook the distinction between elected and
non-elected brokers. It is plausible that this distinction results in
different patterns of interaction with their superiors. Further research focusing
specifically on brokers is necessary to clarify these differences.
