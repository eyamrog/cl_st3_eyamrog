It is noteworthy that gesture can be conceptualized as an
external tool that facilitates human reasoning across various domains, including
visuospatial cognition. Gestures serve both an external communicative function, by
conveying ideas between individuals, and an internal cognitive function, by
being internalized as mental images. This dual role is analogous
to the relationship between thought and language as described by
Vygotsky (1986), a perspective that this review aims to advance.
