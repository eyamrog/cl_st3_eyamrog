Based on our findings, we emphasize the need for further
research in several areas: (i) examining the differences between local
brokers who hold elective mandates and those who do not,
as well as between state and national representatives with respect
to their local connections; (ii) analyzing both the distinctions and
relationships between the dynamics of intermediation that occur during electoral
campaigns and those that persist beyond the electoral period; and
(iii) investigating alternative methods of broker selection beyond political parties,
which have been the primary focus in studies of the
Brazilian context.
