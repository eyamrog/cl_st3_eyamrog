Elections were identified as the primary factor accounting for discontinuities
in political alliances. Electoral defeats, whether involving legislators, mayors, or
city councilors, often result in the dissolution of existing alliances
and create opportunities for new partnerships among those who remain
in office. Apart from election-related discontinuities, it is uncommon for
state representatives to explicitly terminate relationships with their brokers. While
representatives may reduce their efforts to support mayors or councilors
who did not deliver satisfactory electoral results, they typically pursue
alternative compensation strategies. When explicit break-ups do occur, they are
more frequently initiated by mayors, who may seek out other
legislators and explore new partnerships to secure financial resources and
benefits for their municipalities, a pattern also documented by Bezerra
(1999).
