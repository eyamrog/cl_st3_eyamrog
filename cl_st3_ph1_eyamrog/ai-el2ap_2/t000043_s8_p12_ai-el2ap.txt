To the best of our knowledge, and following consultation with
two experts in SCCS/SCRI design, no specific methodological assessment tool
has been reported or validated for evaluating the methodology of
SCCS/SCRI designs. In 2018, Wachira et al. adapted the Newcastle-Ottawa
Scale, originally developed for quality assessment of cohort studies, to
evaluate SCCS study designs in their systematic review of the
etiology of Guillain-Barr√© syndrome. The present study aims to propose
a methodological quality assessment tool for use in the evaluation
of SCCS/SCRI study designs.
