The literature on the Brazilian context has highlighted the significance
of political parties in structuring political relationships (Bezerra, 1999). Empirical
studies indicate that these organizations play a substantial role in
optimizing electoral outcomes across different election cycles and federative levels,
and that success in mayoral elections increases a party’s likelihood
of success in subsequent legislative contests (Fleischer, 2002; Carneiro and
Almeida, 2008; Avelino, Biderman, and Barone, 2012; Novaes, 2018). Furthermore,
there is evidence of party coordination in the allocation of
budgetary resources, which appears to be a critical factor in
shaping electoral competition (Baião and Couto, 2017; Meireles, 2019).
