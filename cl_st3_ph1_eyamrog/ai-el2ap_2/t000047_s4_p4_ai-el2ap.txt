The communicator presents evidence supporting the claim of long-lasting fresh
breath, as demonstrated by Social Actor 3. In this scenario,
the woman brushes her teeth at 7:00 in the morning,
and the sensation of fresh breath persists until 13:00 while
she is at the office, and continues until 19:00 when
she returns home. This experience with Oral-B’s 2-IN-1 product prompts
Social Actor 3 to repeatedly affirm the freshness with statements
such as “So fresh,” “Still fresh,” and “And still fresh.”
The advertisement is set in various locations, including the Oral-B
Dental Institute, a bathroom, offices, and a home. The participants
use a range of communicative behaviors, such as head movements
in sagittal, rotational, and lateral directions up to approximately 90
degrees to facilitate gaze, maintaining personal and intimate distances, gestural
touching of the teeth, and demonstrations of the sensation of
fresh breath. The Oral-B communication employs metaphorical elements, particularly in
illustrating the dual benefits of the 2-IN-1 product and its
association with Social Actors 1 and 2. While this construction
is suitable for academic analysis, there is a need to
simplify the message to enhance comprehension for audiences with lower
literacy levels.
