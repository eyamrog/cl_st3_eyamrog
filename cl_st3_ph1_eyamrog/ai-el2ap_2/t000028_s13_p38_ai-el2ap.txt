Using these parameters, the website generated 74 results: three Child
Education Centers (CEIs), 54 Municipal Elementary Schools (EMEFs), and 17
Municipal Nursery Schools (EMEIs). To determine which English language textbook
is most commonly selected for the sixth grade, only data
from the EMEFs were included in the analysis, as compulsory
English language instruction begins exclusively in elementary schools starting from
the sixth grade.
