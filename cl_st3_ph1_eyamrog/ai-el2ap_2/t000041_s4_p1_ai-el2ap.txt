ABA Farm is a highly preserved area, with exotic species
occurring exclusively near residential zones. The site exhibits substantial species
richness, with a total of 322 species recorded, including 38
species documented for the first time in this region. The
Ministry of the Environment (MMA) classifies the area as Caatinga
and identifies it as being at risk of desertification, underscoring
its significance for conservation efforts. The findings from this study
will inform the establishment of a Private Natural Heritage Reserve
(RPPN) on the farm and contribute to the development of
its management plan.
