The investigation of present mood states and their changes over
time is relevant for informing the periodization of training and
competition, as well as for enabling psychological interventions aimed at
optimizing athletes' preparation for competition. Although previous studies, such as
those by Vega Marcos et al. (2008) and Box et
al. (2018), suggest that mood states tend to remain stable
during competitive periods, various stimuli and contextual factors—including competition phase,
field position, location, environment, social interactions, and match outcomes—may influence
the intensity and valence of these states, as demonstrated by
Bueno and Di Bonifácio (2009), Nogueira (2009), Torres-Luque et al.
(2013), and Hagan et al. (2017b). The aim of the
present study was to examine whether the present mood states
of youth soccer players change during a competitive period (comprising
a sequence of matches and training sessions) as a function
of the temporal proximity to a match.
