The Suruwaha have a population of approximately 170 individuals [14]
and their interactions with non-indigenous people are limited to health
workers and representatives of FUNAI (Fundação Nacional do Índio, the
Brazilian government agency responsible for the protection of indigenous peoples).
They reside in a remote area, distant from urban centers,
and engage primarily in agriculture and hunting, with the manufacture
of utensils also constituting an important aspect of their subsistence
activities.
