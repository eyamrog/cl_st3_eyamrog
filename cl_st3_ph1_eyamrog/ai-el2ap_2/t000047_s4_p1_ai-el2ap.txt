This video, which promotes Oral-B, exemplifies the use of multiple
semiotic resources to construct meaning. The various modes employed in
the video, each with distinct affordances, contribute to the overall
meaning potential of the communication. According to the principle of
modal resource integration, elements such as conversational structures, images depicting
both animate and inanimate subjects, music, and color collectively convey
the intended message of the advertisement to the audience.
