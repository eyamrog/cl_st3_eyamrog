At the conclusion of the advertisement, a voiceover states that
the new Oral-B toothpaste is intended for strong teeth and
long-lasting fresh breath. Simultaneously, the image of the female model
reappears, performing specific gestures: she raises her hands and exhales
into them, followed by raising her right hand and tapping
her teeth with her finger twice. The first gesture is
intended to signify fresh breath, while the second is meant
to indicate strong teeth to the audience. The advertisement begins
with rhythmic music at a low tempo and concludes with
melodious sounds at a higher tempo. Throughout the advertisement, orchestral
ambient music is employed to enhance the communication (Till, 2017).
In the final two seconds, the music reaches a high
tempo and is accompanied by repeated shouts of "Smile, Smile,
Smile." These imperative clauses are intended to prompt viewers to
smile, thereby displaying the condition of their teeth. If the
teeth appear white, this is attributed to the effect of
Oral-B; if not, the product is presented as a solution
for improving dental cleanliness. The repeated command to smile encourages
viewers to emulate the smiling behavior of the three actors
featured in the advertisement. The overall objective is to prompt
viewers to assess whether their teeth possess the advertised 2-IN-1
qualities demonstrated in the video.
