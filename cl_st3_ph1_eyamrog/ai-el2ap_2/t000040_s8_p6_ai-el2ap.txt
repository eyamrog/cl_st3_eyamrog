The mandibular canal (MC) is typically singular; however, bifid configurations
have been reported in the literature [6,11,12], and trifid variations
are observed rarely [13]. Nasseh and Aoun [6] suggest that
bifid MCs may be present in all patients, despite their
classification as uncommon, and therefore recommend thorough assessment for their
identification.
