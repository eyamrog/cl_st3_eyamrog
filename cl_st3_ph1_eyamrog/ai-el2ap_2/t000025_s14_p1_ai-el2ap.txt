A scoping review was conducted following the JBIÂ® methodology, which
is designed to map key concepts, clarify definitions, delineate the
boundaries of a subject, summarize existing information, and identify gaps
in research and clinical practice (Peters et al., 2020). In
contrast to a systematic review, which primarily evaluates the effectiveness
of interventions, a scoping review aims to comprehensively identify and
synthesize all available literature on a given topic without applying
strict methodological limitations.
