The Russian invasion of Ukraine represents the culmination of a
crisis that has developed since at least the Maidan protests
in 2014, during which initial democratic demonstrations against electoral fraud
were increasingly influenced by far-right groups (Ishchenko, 2016) and became
closely linked to broader geopolitical competition, as evidenced by the
prompt involvement of US politicians expressing support for Ukraine’s NATO
and Euro-Atlantic ambitions (Sakwa, 2016, pp. 52–53). The perspective that
“Ukraine’s existence transforms Russian power by reducing it significantly” (Brzezinski,
1996, p. 4) has shaped US geopolitical strategy and underscores
the broader significance of the current conflict for European and
global security (Gardner, 2016). The Paris Charter of 1990, grounded
in the Helsinki Final Act and intended to establish lasting
peace and unity in Europe following the Cold War, ultimately
failed to achieve its objectives, primarily because the signatory states
did not sufficiently align their distinct security cultures and traditions
as stipulated in the Charter (Meyer, von Bredow & Evers,
2015). The European Union, particularly through the initiatives of Swedish
and Polish foreign ministers Carl Bildt and Radek Sikorski, developed
the Eastern Partnership to engage former Soviet states other than
Russia; however, rather than mitigating divisions within the continent, this
approach institutionalized them and aimed to facilitate Ukraine’s separation from
Russia, thereby contributing to perceptions of the EU as a
threat comparable to NATO in Russian strategic thinking (Sakwa, 2016,
pp. 39–41). While it is not possible to comprehensively address
all the implications of these developments within a single article,
extensive relevant literature is available (D. Johnstone, 2022; Petro, 2017;
Poch-de-Feliu, 2003, pp. 357–374).
