Oliveira, Martins, and Bracht (2015a) identify several challenges associated with
implementing an expanded conception of health within a school setting,
including resistance among teaching staff to adopt new practices. The
authors argue that when health promotion is integrated into pedagogical
approaches, it becomes a collective responsibility involving all members of
the school community, with particular emphasis on the roles of
teachers.
