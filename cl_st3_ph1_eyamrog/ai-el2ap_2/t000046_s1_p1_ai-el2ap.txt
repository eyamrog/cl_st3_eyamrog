The objective of this study was to analyze the understanding
of health and its relationship with physical education from the
perspectives of teachers and administrators at a public school in
the state of SÃ£o Paulo. This descriptive research employed a
qualitative approach. The sample consisted of eleven teachers and two
coordinators who participated voluntarily. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews
and analyzed using non-aprioristic categories. Health was primarily conceptualized in
terms of well-being, and body practices were identified as the
main connection between physical education and health within the school
context. The findings suggest that physical education has significant potential
to address critical pedagogical approaches to health, particularly in promoting
active lifestyles.
