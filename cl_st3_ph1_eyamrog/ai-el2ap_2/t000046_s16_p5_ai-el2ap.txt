Data collection was conducted using semi-structured interviews, a primary method
identified by Triviños (2008), which emphasizes the researcher's presence and
provides participants with the opportunity to express their ideas freely,
thereby enhancing the depth and detail of the data obtained.
The interview protocol was designed to explore participants' definitions of
health and its relationship with physical education. Data were collected
between March and May 2019, during which the school was
visited on ten occasions. Interviews took place in private settings
within the school, such as management offices, pedagogical coordination rooms,
or the teachers’ lounge, with only the researcher and the
participating teacher present. With the teachers' consent, all interviews were
audio-recorded and subsequently transcribed into electronic files for analysis.
