The adaptation suggestions presented are only a few examples of
approaches for teaching blind students; however, numerous other adapted didactic
materials may also be valuable for research and implementation in
their education. For example, the use of Braille texts (Oliveira
& Reily, 2014), recorded audio materials (Camargo & Nardi, 2006),
structured debates (Camargo & Nardi, 2006), and detailed descriptions of
images and graphs (Ferreira & Dickman, 2015) have been identified
as potentially effective and engaging strategies for supporting the learning
process of blind students.
