The Law of Maximum Duration of the Weekly Day of
Work and Rest establishes a mandatory work schedule of eight
hours per day and six days per week for both
private and public sector employees. It specifies designated rest days
for public employees, which are determined by decree and may
include holidays such as Christmas or Civic Day. The law
also mandates compensation for overtime work and requires that the
workday be divided into two segments, separated by a break.
