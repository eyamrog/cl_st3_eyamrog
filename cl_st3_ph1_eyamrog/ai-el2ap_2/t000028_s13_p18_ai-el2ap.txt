The limited availability of information and insufficient pre-service and in-service
teacher education can contribute to the underdevelopment of autonomy among
blind students, as inadequately prepared teachers may fail to provide
appropriate support and may inadvertently overexplain tasks or supply answers
directly. Biagini and Gonçalves (2017) reported on the outcomes of
a group activity conducted in a third-year elementary school class
comprising both sighted students and one blind student. In this
activity, students were divided into groups of four, with each
member assigned a specific role—reader, writer, communicator, or coordinator—to collaboratively
analyze a text selected by the researchers. The findings indicated
that the blind student exhibited limited independence in completing activities,
frequently relying on assistance from the teacher or peers, even
when engaging with relatively simple exercises.
