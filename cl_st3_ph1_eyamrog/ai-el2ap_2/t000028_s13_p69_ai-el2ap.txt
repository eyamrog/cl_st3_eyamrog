A high-relief calendar can be constructed using Velcro, ethylene-vinyl acetate
(EVA) foam, cardboard, and glue, allowing blind students to assemble
and disassemble it daily. This activity may be integrated with
Activity C and/or Activity B to create a more comprehensive
calendar. The materials would include three sets of EVA cards:
one set containing seven cards for the days of the
week, a second set with 31 cards for the days
of the month, and a third set with 12 cards
for the months. Additionally, a piece of cardboard would serve
as the base, onto which the day of the week,
month, and date cards could be attached using Velcro. As
in the previous proposal, the words and numbers can be
presented either in Braille or, as shown in the digitally
created model below (Image 9), in high-relief alphabetic and numeric
characters.
