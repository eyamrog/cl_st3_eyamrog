From this perspective, it is relevant to consider one of
Paulo Freireâ€™s principles: educators should maintain a stance of patient
impatience (CECCIM, 2007). In the context of our study, this
principle aligns with the immediate need to address and challenge
passive attitudes toward self-care by promoting an active lifestyle. This
approach underscores the potential for a significant relationship between physical
education and health outcomes.
