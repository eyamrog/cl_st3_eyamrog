One challenge associated with the interview method concerns the construction
of the interviewee sample and the potential for resulting bias
(Martin, 2013). As the objective of this stage was to
examine the dynamics involved in building and maintaining alliances, the
sample was composed of state legislators whose teams were likely
to provide relevant instances of this phenomenon. Specifically, representatives elected
for the 2015â€“2018 legislature were selected if at least 30%
of their votes were concentrated in a single region, based
on the premise that legislators with more geographically concentrated support
are more likely to exhibit particularistic behavior (Carvalho, 2003). It
was assumed that these representatives would be more reliant on
local brokers, thereby increasing the probability of obtaining detailed accounts
of such relationships.
