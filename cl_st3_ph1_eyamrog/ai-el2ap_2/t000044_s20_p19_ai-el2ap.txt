In Brazil in 2014, Mortimer et al. investigated how two
university teachers utilized various semiotic modes and facilitated interaction among
these modes to support meaning-making in Chemistry classes. The teachers
were recorded during their lessons, and the recordings were subsequently
analyzed. The analysis demonstrated that each teacher employed and integrated
different semiotic modes, including speech, gestures, and drawings on the
board, as means of communication with students. The study found
that these semiotic modes, particularly gestures, played a significant role
in the construction of meaning within the classroom context.
