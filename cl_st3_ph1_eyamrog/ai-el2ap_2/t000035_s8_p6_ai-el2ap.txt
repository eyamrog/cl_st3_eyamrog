According to the 2016 annual management report, structural and logistical
challenges significantly hinder the mobility of indigenous populations to urban
centers. Additionally, the limited availability or complete absence of specialized
services near indigenous villages contributes to the near absence of
prosthetic rehabilitation procedures for the indigenous population within the Special
Indigenous Health District of Bahia (DSEI Bahia). Consequently, the demand
for prosthetic services in this region substantially exceeds the existing
service capacity.
