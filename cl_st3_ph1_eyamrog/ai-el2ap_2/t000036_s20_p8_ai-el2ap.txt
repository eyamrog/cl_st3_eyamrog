The indigenous population constituted the primary segment of the peasantry
and played an active role within the hacienda system. Following
the indigenous were day laborers, small landowners, and artisans. Mestizos,
including merchants, carriers, employees, and urban artisans, occupied the next
social stratum, while urban whites represented the highest social group.
By 1930, perceptions of the indigenous population had shifted significantly
compared to 1875. Factors such as increased democratization, the emergence
of a more coherent national state, the influence of international
ideological movements, and the rise of indigenismo contributed to this
change. As a result, the Ecuadorian indigenous population was no
longer regarded merely as an illiterate labor force (Saint-Geours 1994:
168).
