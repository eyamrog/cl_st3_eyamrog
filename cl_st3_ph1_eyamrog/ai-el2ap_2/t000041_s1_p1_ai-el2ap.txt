The Caatinga biome covers approximately 912,529 km² and represents one
of the most distinct phytogeographic regions in Brazil. Its vegetation
exhibits considerable variation depending on geographic location and environmental conditions.
This study aimed to conduct a floristic survey of the
ABA farm, situated in the municipality of Passagem in the
Paraíba backlands mesoregion. Over a four-year period, fortnightly botanical collections
were performed across all vegetation physiognomies present on the farm,
utilizing standardized floristic survey and herborization protocols. The survey identified
a total of 322 species, distributed among 194 genera and
62 botanical families. The families with the highest species richness
were Fabaceae (48 species), Euphorbiaceae (23 species), Convolvulaceae (21 species),
Malvaceae (19 species), and Asteraceae (15 species). The recorded growth
habits included herbs (108 species), trees (59 species), subshrubs (56
species), shrubs (46 species), lianas (46 species), and epiphytes and
parasites (four species). Additionally, 38 species were documented as new
records for the state of Paraíba.
