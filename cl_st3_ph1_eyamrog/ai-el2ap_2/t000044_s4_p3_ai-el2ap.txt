During typical speech, particularly when individuals elaborate on their thinking
or attempt to explain a concept—such as a scientific model—to
a teacher or peer, gestures are frequently employed to aid
communication. These gestures are significant because they can reveal students’
mental representations and may help identify gaps in their verbal
explanations. Consequently, this literature review concludes by emphasizing the important
role that gestures can play in the teaching and learning
process, offering new perspectives and approaches for education, as well
as additional resources that may contribute to students’ academic development.
