The present study contributes to the understanding of modal activities
within communicative environments by exemplifying the functional role of mode
across various devices and settings in the context of a
semiotic configuration. Specifically, this research examines the interconnections among modal
components, focusing on how different devices generate distinct affordances that
facilitate the production and dissemination of meaning to the target
audience. As demonstrated later, the analytical frameworks developed by Halliday
and Matthiessen (2014), Kress and van Leeuwen (2021), Baldry and
Thibault (2010), and Norris (2019) are employed to analyze modes,
with particular emphasis on their application to the semiotic system
of a New Oral-B Toothpaste advertisement (hereafter referred to as
the ad).
