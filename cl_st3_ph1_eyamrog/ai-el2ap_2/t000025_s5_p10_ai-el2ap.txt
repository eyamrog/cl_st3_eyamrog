Antimicrobial agents such as honey, octenidine, polyhexanide, and metronidazole have
demonstrated efficacy in managing pain associated with malignant fungating wounds
(MFWs) by reducing the local microbial load, which is a
key factor in the development of pain as an indicator
of infection (Swanson & Angel, 2022). The progressive nature of
cancer increases the susceptibility of MFWs to microbial colonization, particularly
by anaerobic microorganisms, which contribute to wound odor, exudate, and
pain. Therefore, the application of topical antimicrobial substances to control
the microbial burden in MFWs is associated with reductions in
exudate, odor, and pain (Vardhan et al., 2019; Villela-Castro et
al., 2018; Finlayson et al., 2017b).
