The final area of inquiry addresses the significance of factors
other than political parties in the selection of brokers. While
existing literature on Brazil predominantly focuses on party-affiliated brokers, and
our survey confirms their relevance, our findings also indicate that
alternative selection criteria, such as personal and regional ties, play
an important role. These factors have received limited scholarly attention,
likely due to challenges associated with their measurement and operationalization.
To enhance understanding of the dynamics within multi-level support networks
and to further develop theoretical frameworks, it is essential to
systematically investigate these additional factors.
