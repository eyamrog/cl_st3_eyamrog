Our interviews indicate that state legislators often exhibit reactive behavior,
consistent with findings by Nichter (2018) regarding the relationship between
politicians and voters, wherein politicians frequently respond to voter requests
by addressing their demands. However, it is also important to
recognize that representatives can act proactively. For instance, one interviewee
noted that there are “many things that the state provides”
of which mayors may be unaware. In such cases, the
legislator’s office facilitates the delivery of benefits to municipalities, a
dynamic also identified by Bezerra (1999, p. 121).
