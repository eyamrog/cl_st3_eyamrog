Maldonado and Silva (2018), in their analysis of REESP curricula
related to physical education (PE), identify the presence of multiple
pedagogical perspectives over time: in 1978, the curriculum emphasized fitness
and the development of motor skills; by 1991, the focus
shifted to a psychomotor approach with elements of critical discussion
influenced by the human sciences; in 1996, the psychomotor approach
persisted but incorporated aspects of developmental theory; and in 2008,
the curriculum adopted critical approaches to PE, specifically the critic-overcoming
and critic-emancipatory models. Examination of Chart 1 indicates that 12
out of 13 teachers experienced at least two distinct phases
of the PE curriculum at REESP. Consequently, the data regarding
teachersâ€™ understanding of health and its relationship with PE reflect
meanings shaped by a transition from instrumental to critical pedagogical
approaches.
