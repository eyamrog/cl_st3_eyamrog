According to Qiu et al. (2020), the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress
Index (CPDI) assesses the frequency of 22 factors, including anger,
anxiety, negative mood, irritability, exhaustion, sluggishness, helplessness, avoidance, indecisiveness, sleeplessness,
poor appetite, distrust, physical symptoms, bladder and bowel issues, obsessive
behavior, insecurity, fear, sadness, dissemination of negative news, impaired social
function, lack of judgment, and attention deficit. The content validity
of the CPDI was verified by psychiatrists at the Shanghai
Mental Health Center. The instrument demonstrated high internal consistency, with
a Cronbachâ€™s alpha of 0.95 (p < 0.001) (Qiu et
al., 2020). The present study aims to empirically determine the
factor structure of the CPDI.
