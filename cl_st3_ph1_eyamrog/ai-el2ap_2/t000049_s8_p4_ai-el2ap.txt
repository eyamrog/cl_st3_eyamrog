Several European policy documents (Indicazioni Nazionali per il Curricolo della
Scuola dellâ€™Infanzia e del Primo Ciclo di Istruzione, 2012; Quality
Toolbox: Executive Summary, 2012; Proposal for Key Principles of a
Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education and Care, 2014) explicitly
reject the notion of evaluation as a process limited to
classification and judgment. Instead, these documents emphasize that the primary
function of teacher-led evaluation is to recognize, describe, and support
the growth and development of children. They assign a central
role to professional practices such as observation and documentation, and
highlight the importance of self-evaluation by both children and teachers.
Collaborative analysis of previously collected documentation is considered beneficial, as
it facilitates the identification of coherence between pedagogical concepts, cultural
values, and the actions implemented to realize them (Raso, Lampugnani,
Marone, Lichene, 2020). Within this framework, evaluation is regarded as
an essential instrument for the ongoing enhancement of the educational
provision in schools, with the objective of effectively supporting children's
development. Consistent with this approach, the Proposal for Key Principles
of a Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education and Care
(2012) assigns to evaluation the functions of recognizing, accompanying, describing,
and documenting developmental processes, while explicitly avoiding the classification and
judgment of individual performances.
