The selection of volunteers was facilitated by the pedagogical coordinator
during collective pedagogical planning. Professionals were approached individually to avoid
disrupting school activities. The selected school is located in the
municipality of Santos, SÃ£o Paulo, and offers middle school education
for grades 6 through 9. According to the most recent
Basic Education Census, elementary and middle school teachers constitute 62.6%
of registered teachers in Brazil, and the public education system
is the most extensive, encompassing approximately 77% of Brazilian schools
(BRASIL, 2020).
