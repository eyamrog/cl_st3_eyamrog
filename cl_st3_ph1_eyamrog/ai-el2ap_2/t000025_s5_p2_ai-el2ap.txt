Cancer patients experience a range of symptoms, including pain that
encompasses both neurophysiological and affective components (Wood, 2021). In this
population, pain may be intensified and can contribute to the
deterioration of bodily functions, as well as psychological responses such
as grief, anxiety, fear, uncertainty, and a general sense of
distress (Brant, 2017).
