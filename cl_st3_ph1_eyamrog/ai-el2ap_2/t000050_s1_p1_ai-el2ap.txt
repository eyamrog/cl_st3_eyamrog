To enhance understanding of the epidemiology of American cutaneous leishmaniasis
(ACL) among indigenous populations residing in forested regions, we investigated
the sand fly fauna in areas of active disease transmission
within the Brazilian Amazon. The two datasets presented here consist
of sand fly occurrence records from the Suruwaha Indigenous Land
in the state of Amazonas, collected between 2012 and 2013,
and from the Wajãpi Indigenous Land in the state of
Amapá, collected between 2013 and 2014. Sand flies were sampled
using unbaited CDC-like light traps at multiple sites within each
study area and were identified to the species level by
taxonomists specializing in Amazonian fauna. In total, 4,646 records were
obtained, with 1,428 from Suruwaha and 3,218 from Wajãpi. These
data provide valuable information for elucidating ACL transmission dynamics and
the distribution of sand fly vectors in these regions.
