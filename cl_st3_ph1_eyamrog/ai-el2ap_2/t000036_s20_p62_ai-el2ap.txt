The minimum salary was established by law in 1936, following
a period characterized by labor disputes and political negotiations. It
is important to note that, beginning in 1932, Ecuador experienced
significant political instability, with approximately twelve individuals serving as heads
of the executive branch between 1932 and 1940. In 1934,
one of the most significant labor conflicts of the decade
occurred: the strike at the La Internacional factory, which was
among the country’s leading textile industries. According to the Ministry
of Government and Social Security’s Report to the Nation, one
of the primary demands of the strike leaders was the
establishment of a minimum wage of 1.50 sucres for an
eight-hour workday (Baquerizo 1934:74).
