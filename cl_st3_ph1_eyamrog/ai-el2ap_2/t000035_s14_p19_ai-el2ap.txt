A descriptive analysis of the sample was conducted using frequency
distributions, measures of central tendency, and measures of variability. As
the data did not satisfy the assumptions required for parametric
analysis, Wilcoxon nonparametric tests were employed to compare the impact
of oral health on quality of life between the two
time points (t0 and t1), as well as to compare
patients' perceptions of upper and lower dentures. Comparisons of patients'
perceptions regarding the ability to chew different foods were performed
using the Friedman test. Effect sizes were calculated for all
relevant comparisons. All analyses were conducted using the R1 program,
with a significance level set at 5%.
