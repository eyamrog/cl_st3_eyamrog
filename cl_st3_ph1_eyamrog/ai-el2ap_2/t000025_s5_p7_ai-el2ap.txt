The use of a non-adherent and absorbent polyurethane foam impregnated
with ibuprofen was reported in 11% of the studies, all
of which demonstrated positive outcomes for malignant fungating wound (MFW)
pain control. This finding is consistent with the known anti-inflammatory
and analgesic effects of ibuprofen when applied to the wound
bed. Nevertheless, further research specifically designed to evaluate the efficacy
of this therapy for MFW-related pain, with rigorous methodological descriptions,
is necessary to support its safe recommendation, particularly in light
of its additional nonadherent and absorbent properties (Gottrup et al.,
2008).
