The scientific literature on this topic (Giordano, 2010; Andersson &
Gullberg, 2014; Bertolino et al., 2017) asserts that scientific education
should not be confined to the transmission of content alone.
Children inherently possess a range of curiosities, questions, and interests
that educators must identify, support, and foster through targeted pedagogical
approaches, even at the onset of formal education. Such approaches
should be designed to promote and sustain children's interests and
discoveries, thereby encouraging further inquiry and learning (Bondioli & Savio,
2014). In line with this perspective, the Indicazioni Nazionali per
il curricolo of 2012 (updated in “Nuovi scenari,” 2018) addresses
scientific education within the framework of “La conoscenza del mondo,”
emphasizing the importance of nurturing children's curiosity, their interest in
observed phenomena, their capacity to formulate questions and investigate, and
their willingness to share discoveries with peers and teachers.
