In Brazilian politics, cooperation among politicians operating at different levels
of the political system is a common practice aimed at
achieving objectives related to both electoral competition and governance. Such
cooperation is evident in alliances formed between legislators at the
state and federal levels and local officials such as mayors
and councilors. These alliances may be formal and limited to
the electoral period, as in the case of the so-called
dobradas, or they may take the form of informal collaborations
that extend beyond elections. Within these relationships, local politicians are
frequently characterized as brokers, a term used in the literature
to describe actors who mediate interactions between higher-level politicians and
voters.
