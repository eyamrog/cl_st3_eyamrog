The literature has documented the uncertain nature of these partnerships
in Brazil and other contexts (Bezerra, 1999; Aspinall, 2014; Novaes,
2018). However, in contrast to these findings, our interviewees less
frequently reported disappointment with mayors or other local brokers in
relation to betrayal or opportunistic and predatory behavior. When asked
about these issues, interviewees often expressed understanding of the pressures
faced by mayors.
