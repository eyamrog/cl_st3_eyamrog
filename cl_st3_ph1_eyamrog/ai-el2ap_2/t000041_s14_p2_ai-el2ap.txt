ABA Farm is situated 4.6 km from the urban area
of Passagem and encompasses a total area of 350 hectares,
of which 120 hectares are designated as a legal reserve.
While the majority of the farm is located on flat
terrain, the caatinga vegetation also extends into mountainous regions characterized
by undulating to strongly undulating relief, with elevations ranging from
300 to 810 meters, particularly in the Aba Mountains and
Preacas areas (Beltr√£o et al., 2005).
