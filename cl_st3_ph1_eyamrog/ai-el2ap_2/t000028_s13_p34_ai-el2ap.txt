The limited research and insufficient teacher preparation concerning the education
of blind students, both within and beyond the field of
English language instruction, may negatively impact these studentsâ€™ inclusion and
independence. Consequently, the ongoing development and implementation of intervention methods
and adapted materials that facilitate the participation of blind students
in classroom activities are essential to reduce segregation and promote
student autonomy. Following the presentation of relevant theoretical concepts, this
study details the practical procedures undertaken, including the selection of
the textbook and unit, as well as the proposed adaptations
for specific didactic activities.
