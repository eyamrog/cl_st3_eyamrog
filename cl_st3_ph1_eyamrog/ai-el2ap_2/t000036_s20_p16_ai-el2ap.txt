The purchasing power of Ecuador's economically active population can be
analyzed by distinguishing between different groups. The first group, which
relied primarily on agricultural and livestock production as well as
community-based exchange systems, maintained stable purchasing power during the international
crisis. This stability can be attributed to the group's reliance
on internal commercial activities, which insulated them from fluctuations in
domestic and international market prices. Consequently, this segment of the
population functioned as a buffer during the international crisis, as
their subsistence was largely independent of both national and international
trade dynamics.
