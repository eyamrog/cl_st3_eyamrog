Within the category of heteroglossic expressions, the degree of dialogism
in an utterance varies according to the extent to which
other voices are either explicitly acknowledged and considered or concealed
(Morson & Emerson, 1990, p. 146). Utterances can therefore be
classified as either dialogically expansive or contractive. Dialogically expansive utterances
allow for the inclusion of alternative positions and voices, thereby
increasing dialogic space, whereas dialogically contractive utterances limit dialogic space
by challenging, dismissing, or restricting the range of alternative perspectives
(Martin & White, 2005, pp. 102â€“103), a process referred to
as discursive struggle.
