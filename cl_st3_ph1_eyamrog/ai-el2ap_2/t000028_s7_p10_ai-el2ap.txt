According to the classification proposed by Santos et al. (2018),
which is based on data from the World Health Organization
(WHO) published in 2010, the visual spectrum is categorized into
four levels: (1) no visual impairment, (2) moderate visual impairment,
(3) severe visual impairment, and (4) blindness. These categories are
presented in Table 1.
