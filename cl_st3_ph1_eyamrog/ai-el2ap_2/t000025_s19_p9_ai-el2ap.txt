Eleven of the 70 studies (15.7%) recommended the use of
hydrogels for the management of malignant fungating wound (MFW)-related pain.
The included studies comprised non-systematic reviews (54.5%), case studies (36.3%),
and systematic reviews (9.2%). Of these, eight studies (72.7%) mentioned
hydrogels only briefly, typically as an optional dressing intended to
reduce pain by maintaining a moist wound environment, but provided
limited discussion and lacked supporting evidence. Additionally, hydrogels were referenced
as vehicles for the delivery of other active substances, such
as opioids, anesthetics, and antibiotics. None of the studies described
a standardized protocol for hydrogel application, and no outcome data
were reported.
