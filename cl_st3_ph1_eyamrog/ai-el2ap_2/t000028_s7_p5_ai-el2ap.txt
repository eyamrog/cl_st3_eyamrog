The aim of this study is to propose adaptations for
didactic activities from the most widely used textbook in Santa
Maria, RS, in 2021, specifically for sixth-grade blind students. To
achieve this, a literature review was conducted focusing on previous
research related to the teaching and learning processes of blind
students. Based on the findings of this review, adaptations of
selected didactic activities for blind students are suggested. Prior to
discussing these adaptations, the following sections present an overview of
the national inclusion of blind individuals in social and educational
contexts, including an analysis of relevant national legislation, historical milestones,
and key perspectives on the education of blind students.
