Given this context, anxiety symptoms may be associated with the
inappropriate use of prescription anxiolytic drugs among university health students
(PÃ©rez et al., 2023). This population is considered at increased
risk for the misuse of these psychotropic medications due to
factors such as a certain level of economic independence, reduced
direct supervision by parents or guardians, and a higher likelihood
of using these substances to manage the demands of academic
activities (Nogueira et al., 2021; Souza et al., 2022).
