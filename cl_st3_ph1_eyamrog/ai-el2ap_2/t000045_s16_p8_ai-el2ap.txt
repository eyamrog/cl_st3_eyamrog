Analysis of the proportion of representatives who identified mayors and/or
city councilors as significant supporters in their election reveals some
variation across states (Appendix B). In both survey waves, these
local officials are most frequently cited in Bahia, Pernambuco, and
Tocantins, and least frequently in Mato Grosso, Rio Grande do
Sul, and Rio de Janeiro. This pattern remains consistent despite
differences in state size. With respect to political parties (limited
to those with ten or more interviewed members), the PT
consistently exhibits a lower-than-average proportion of mentions of mayors and/or
councilors in both waves, whereas DEM, PMDB, PP, and PSDB
display higher-than-average proportions (Appendix B).
