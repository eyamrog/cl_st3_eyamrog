In Bolivia, a decree published on June 27, 1933, authorized
wage increases in both the public and private sectors. The
magnitude of these increases varied according to the productive sector
and the level of monthly income. Specifically, workers earning more
than 1,201 bolivianos per month received a fixed increase of
780 bolivianos; workers earning less than 100 bolivianos per month
experienced a 120% increase in their salaries; individuals with a
daily wage of one boliviano also received a 120% increase;
and domestic workers earning up to five bolivianos per day
were granted an 80% increase (Owen 1938).
