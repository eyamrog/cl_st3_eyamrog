This study provides evidence that mayors and local councilors serve
as important intermediaries for certain state representatives, with regional ties
and personal relationships constituting significant factors in the formation of
political alliances. The findings indicate that legislators maintain these partnerships
by responding to requests from local brokers, intervening to address
issues within government bureaucracy, and allocating public resources to municipalities.
Furthermore, the analysis suggests that while legislators attempt to monitor
the actions of brokers, they are not consistently able or
inclined to impose sanctions when necessary.
