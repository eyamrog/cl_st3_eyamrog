By April 11, 20,700 cases of COVID-19 had been reported
in Brazil, and the country’s death toll had reached 1,124.
Following widespread media coverage depicting overwhelmed hospitals and mass graves,
President Bolsonaro stated that he was not responsible for worsening
the crisis, asserting that he was “not a gravedigger.” He
also promoted the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine (hereafter HCQ)
as treatments for COVID-19. Bolsonaro’s advocacy for these drugs was
primarily politically motivated and reflected his alignment with the policies
of then-U.S. President Donald Trump. Rather than initiating a comprehensive
public health campaign, the promotion of HCQ was used to
support a political narrative. Bolsonaro claimed that HCQ rendered social
restrictions unnecessary and would ultimately result in herd immunity for
Brazil. Brazilian scientists who questioned the efficacy of HCQ faced
defamatory attacks on social media, legal investigations by authorities, and,
in some cases, death threats. Bolsonaro’s endorsement of HCQ contributed
to securing the support of the business sector, which opposed
a nationwide lockdown, as well as right-wing evangelical groups, who
constitute approximately one-fourth of Brazil’s population and sought to continue
religious services without restrictions.
