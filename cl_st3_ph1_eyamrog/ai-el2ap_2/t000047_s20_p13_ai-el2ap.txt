The notable effectiveness of the new Oral-B toothpaste prompted the
participant to state that the toothpaste made her mouth feel
"so fresh at 7:00; still fresh at 13:00; and still
fresh at 19:00." For reasons of conciseness and to avoid
unnecessary repetition, the full expressions—"[it is] so still fresh; [it
is] still fresh; and [it is] still fresh"—were not used.
The emphasis placed on these statements is an intentional strategy
to make the product’s key attribute more memorable. From a
semantic perspective, the qualifiers "so" and "still" indicate varying degrees
of intensity regarding the product’s effects on oral freshness and
breath. These linguistic choices also support the accuracy of the
claims made by Social Actor 1 and Social Actor 2.
According to Social Actor 3, the consumer, these claims about
Oral-B toothpaste are substantiated.
