Another approach to addressing the imbalance between the volume of
requests and available resources is to seek additional sources of
support for the municipality. For instance, representatives may note that
certain organizations, such as Apaes and Santa Casas, receive funding
from multiple legislators. In such cases, representatives may direct the
mayor or other local officials to alternative legislators, thereby allowing
them to allocate their own resources to areas where the
potential for electoral returns is higher and outcomes are more
predictable.
