The Wajãpi are an Indigenous group comprising approximately 1,200 individuals
[15], residing in 80 small villages dispersed throughout their territory.
Their subsistence strategies include agriculture, fishing, hunting, and gathering, with
periodic relocation of villages to facilitate ecological recovery of previously
occupied areas. Access to these villages is possible via roads,
rivers, streams, and forest trails. The reestablishment of traditional Wajãpi
settlement patterns and territorial dispersion has been critical for maintaining
both the quality of life and effective territorial surveillance, thereby
supporting the level of resource abundance deemed sufficient by the
Wajãpi [16]. Over the past decade, activities by large mining
companies and the construction of hydroelectric plants in the vicinity
of the Wajãpi Indigenous Land (WIL) have posed significant threats
to the Wajãpi’s quality of life, primarily through forest degradation,
environmental contamination, and increased social vulnerability. These changes have coincided
with a rise in crop pests and the incidence of
endemic diseases such as malaria and leishmaniasis.
