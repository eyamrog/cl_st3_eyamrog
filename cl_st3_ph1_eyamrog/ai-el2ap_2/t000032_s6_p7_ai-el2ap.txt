Factor V (Physiologic) exhibited the most substantial changes during the
competition. The self-reported statements associated with this factor (“I feel
cold,” “I feel warm,” and “I am thirsty”) may be
particularly sensitive to both situational and contextual variables. In this
study, the experimenter was able to identify contextual factors, such
as the likelihood of classification in the championship, as well
as situational factors, including whether training sessions occurred on synthetic
or natural grass fields and the prevailing meteorological conditions during
the events. However, these variables were not experimentally controlled in
the present study.
