This review article employed both the historical-comparative and historical-analytical methods.
The historical-comparative method facilitated the identification of similarities, differences, and
trends in the implementation of minimum wages across the Latin
American region, with the most significant trend being the differentiated
application of minimum wages according to geographical areas and types
of work. The historical-analytical method was instrumental in reconstructing the
legal, economic, and social contexts that shaped labor relations in
Ecuador during the period under study. As a result, the
article presents and analyzes new quantitative and qualitative data.
