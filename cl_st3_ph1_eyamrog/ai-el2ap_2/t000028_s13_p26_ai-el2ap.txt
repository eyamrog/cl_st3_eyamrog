The proposed teaching methods for including blind students in the
classroom are applicable not only to the field of Physics
but also to a wide range of educational disciplines, as
they can be adapted for use in various subject areas.
In the context of the present study, although the articles
reviewed may differ from the current research in terms of
pedagogical objectives, instructional strategies, and disciplinary focus, they nonetheless provide
valuable insights that inform the development and adaptation of EAL
activities for blind students.
