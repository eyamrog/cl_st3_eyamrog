Camargo and Nardi (2006) present alternative teaching methods proposed by
undergraduate Physics teachers to facilitate the inclusion of blind students
in the classroom. For the adaptation of printed materials, such
as written assessments, the prospective teachers recommended the use of
oral activities and recorded audio resources. In the context of
practical experiments, they suggested employing everyday materials that engage tactile
and auditory senses. Additionally, group activities were proposed to promote
interaction and collaboration between sighted and non-sighted students, including debates,
reading and discussion sessions that utilize oral communication and allow
students to assume complementary roles, as well as theatrical performances.
The authors and the undergraduate students further emphasize the importance
of adopting active, inclusive, dialogic, and participatory educational approaches that
foster student reflection, analysis, and decision-making, as well as teachers’
awareness of students’ ideas throughout the educational process (Camargo &
Nardi, 2006, p. 56).
