Data analysis - To check the sampling sufficiency and estimate
the number of species potentially present, the following species richness
estimators were used: Bootstrap, Jackknife 1, Jackknife 2, Chao 1,
Chao 2, and ICE. Calculations were performed using the EstimateS
9.1 (Colwell 2013). The estimator curve was plotted together with
the observed species curve. For this analysis, all treatments were
counted together (each sample = total spiders collected monthly per
treatment). It was verified whether there are significant differences (p
< 0.05) between the number of collected individuals between treatments,
using the Shapiro-wilk test, Levene test, ANOVA test, post-hoc Tukey
HSD test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and post-hoc Dunnâ€™s, was using program
R study (R Development Core Team 2009), but uninformative results
were not discussed in this study. Through the program Past
2.1 (Hammer et al. 2001) was realized the Simpson Diversity
t test (significant differences = < 0.05) and Cluster analysis
was performed using the Bray-Curtis similarity index and the UPGMA
clustering method.
