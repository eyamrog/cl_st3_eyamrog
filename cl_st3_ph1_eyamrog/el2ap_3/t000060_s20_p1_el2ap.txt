Our analysis was organized into eight excerpts that showed significant
elements for discussion such as: the adjacency pair “question/answer”, discourse
markers, so-prefaced questions, paraphrases, positive politeness, solidarity politeness, negative politeness,
deference politeness, properties of formulations (preservation, transformation, and deletion), tag
questions, facework strategies, verbal planning markers, mitigation devices, and hedges.
