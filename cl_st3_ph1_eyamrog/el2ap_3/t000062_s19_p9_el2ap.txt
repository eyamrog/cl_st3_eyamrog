Xenoctenidae was represented by 30 individuals, 20 (67%) of these
collected in the IA, 7 (23%) in the DA and
3 (10%) in the FA. The treatments showed a significant
difference in the ANOVA test (F-value = 4,017; P-Value =
0.0781) and the Tukey HSD test obtained differences only between
IA and FA (P-value = 0,0781). When compared to the
time of year, the family showed differences only in the
hot and humid period in the IA and FA and
in the cold and dry period in the FA (W-test
= 0,7500; P-value = 0,00000000000000002). Levene test using the mean
as a basis, showing difference in the homogeneity of variances
only for period of heat and humidity (F-value = 5,0256;
P- value = 0,05223), but when the median was used
as a basis, this difference was not recovered (F-value =
0,4138; P-value = 0,6787). Data from the time of year
did not show significant differences in the Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's
post-hoc, adjusted for the Bonferroni method.
