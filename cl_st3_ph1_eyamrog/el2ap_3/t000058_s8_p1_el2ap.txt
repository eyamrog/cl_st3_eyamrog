The Parasitology Collection of the Basic Pathology Department, housed in
the Biological Science Sector of the Federal University of Paraná
(ColPar/DPAT/BL/UFPR), was set up in the 1960s through different research
projects. One of researchers who contributed to this initiative was
Professor and Doctor Ana Leuch Lozovei, who, with her students
and collaborators, collected and identified the different taxonomic groups found
there. The collection includes some insect vector families, notably the
family Culicidae, comprising specimens captured in different municipalities in the
state of Paraná, in southern Brazil, between 1967 and 1999.
