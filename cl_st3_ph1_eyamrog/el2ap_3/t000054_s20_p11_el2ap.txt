In the Amazon basin, shamans use a concoction they call
ayahuasca to induce a state of ecstasy in which visual
and auditory hallucinations occur. Although there are different ways to
prepare the drink, it is considered that the most common
is the mixture of two plants (Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria
viridis).
