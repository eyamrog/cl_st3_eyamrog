Chlorophyll content - The leaf chlorophyll content was estimated with
a chlorophylometer Opti- Sciences CCM-200Â®, in two leaves per plant
of five plants in each experimental treatment. According to the
manufacturer, this device does not measure the chlorophyll content directly,
since it analyzes the leaf transmittance of light, expressing the
results in CCI - chlorophyll content index. Hence, it serves
as for comparison among treatments.
