It is important to highlight that job losses in Brazil
were significantly higher for employees without a formal contract. According
to Bridi (2020), the number of workers in the private
sector decreased 8.9% among those with a formal contract and
21.6% among those without a formal contract, between the first
and the second quarter of 2020. But, among informal workers
who have not lost their jobs, participation in remote work
was close to that of the formal private sector (Figure
