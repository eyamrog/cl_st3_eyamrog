Therefore, the pandemic, regarding the possibility of remote work, had
the effect of widening the existing inequalities, in favor of
wealthier, more educated, and more formalized workers in the labor
market and imposing on the others the need to choose
between employment and income versus risk of contagion. The results
of the study provide insights that should be considered by
policy makers, since the effects of the pandemic on the
labor market will remain, at least to some extent, after
the return of economic activity.
