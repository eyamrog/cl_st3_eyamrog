It was observed the presence of neutral polysaccharides in the
endosperm region, as constituents of the cell wall, indicating the
presence of cellulose. And, when stained with Lugol, neutral polysaccharide
grains were observed, conferring a high concentration of starch grains
distributed in amyloplasts (figure 1d, see arrow). Analyses of 120
DAA seeds, non-cryopreserved (figure 1c) and cryopreserved (figure 1f); 135
DAA non-cryopreserved seeds (figure 1d) and cryopreserved (figure 1g), as
well as 150 DAA non-cryopreserved seeds (figure 1e) and cryopreserved
(figure 1h), all showed structural integrity after both conservation treatments.
