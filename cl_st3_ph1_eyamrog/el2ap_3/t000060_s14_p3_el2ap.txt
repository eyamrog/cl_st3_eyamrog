This work follows an empirical-inductive approach, as the texts were
obtained from concrete situations of usage and the analysis was
carried out by examining all the occurrences for our qualitative
interpretations. The data are presented in a format to illustrate
how the language was spoken in real-life interactions which exhibited
marks of local verbal planning (verbal planning and speaking occurred
at the same time). By studying the cases, we have
considered possible meanings and interpretations that led us to the
theoretical framework employed in this research. With the aim of
delimiting our corpus, we have chosen the types of formulations,
politeness, and facework that could provide more interesting and noteworthy
elements for analysis, that is, devices that were commonly used
by speakers to achieve their purposes. Therefore, we have established
the recurrence of those devices as a criterion for data
selection. Based on that, we proceeded to the organization of
the excerpts, which followed the chronological order of the events:
the video containing the final day of the prosecutor’s cross-examination
(Day 25) in Maricopa County Superior Court in Phoenix, Arizona,
on February 21, 20139 and a reporter’s transcript of proceedings
(testimony of Jodi Ann Arias) on November 3, 201410. We
highlight that the excerpts taken from the video were transcribed
according to Leite (2017, p. 21-22).
