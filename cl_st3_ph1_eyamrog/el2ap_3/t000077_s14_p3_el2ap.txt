We used monthly PNAD COVID-19 microdata from May to August
2020. For our purpose, we kept in our sample only
workers who received labor income, aged between 16 and 65
and who did not attend school – to prevent conflicts
between work and study decisions. Table 1 shows the filters
applied to the initial sample and the final sample. Our
variable of interest, worked-from-home, is equal to 1 if the
respondent answered affirmatively to the question: “Last week, were you
in remote work?”. The value 0 was attributed for those
who did not change their work routine activities1. Our final
sample had 419,840 responses, of which 46,261 (11.02%) declared affirmatively
that they were working from home.
