Concerning formulations, we observe three properties: preservation, transformation, and deletion.
The original question is “After leaving that convention, did you
have any type of impressions about -- that you learned
from convention?”, later reformulated by “Did you have other impressions
having to do with your life and where your life
was going?”. The aspect related to her impressions is preserved,
but the interpretation changes when some aspects of the news
delivered are deleted (impressions related to what she had learned
from that convention) and later transformed (other impressions that had
to do with her life and where her life was
going). The question is semantically transformed since the defendant is
not being asked if she has any type of impressions,
but if she has other impressions, restricting them to those
which have to do with Arias’s life and where her
life was going. The markers well and you know occur
again in Excerpt 6 with the same meaning effects as
described in Excerpts 4 and 5.
