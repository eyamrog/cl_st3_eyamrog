In addition to this introduction and conclusion, this article proceeds
as follows. Section 2 presents a brief description of the
important mainstream studies that contradict the orthodox presumptions that theoretically
grounded the capital account liberalization processes in emerging economies during
the 1990s. Section 3 provides some mainstream studies that empirically
ground new recommendations on capital controls and macroprudential policies. Section
4 discusses the effectiveness of capital controls and macroprudential policies
present in the recent literature. Based on this, section 5
presents the main orthodox models that ground the use of
capital controls and then synthetizes the main results of the
selected papers on the effectiveness of capital controls and prudential
policies, as well as the evolution of mainstream economics on
financial openness and capital controls from the liberalizing reforms to
the post global financial crisis period.
