its backbone is the collection of data through the application
of online questionnaires, to SSH researchers at different stages of
their academic career (senior researchers - represented by leaders and
vice-leaders of research groups7, doctoral students8 and researchers in training
- understood as students with USR experience), in addition to
an international stage9, seeking to produce knowledge about the consequences
of normative interference (heteronym imposition) in the formation and exercise
of moral autonomy of researchers.
