At this stage, seeking to represent the beginning of the
researcher's profession, the possibility of approaching research training from the
process of orientation of the end of course paper (TCC)
was conveyed, however, USR, in most cases, precedes chronologically the
orientation of the TCC, appearing as a first contact with
the research. In addition, the guidance practice of the TCC
is implemented in different ways in the institutions and, in
general, less rigorous than the USR in terms of compliance
with the research method and ethical procedures. In this sense,
in USR, the researcher in training is integrated into a
consolidated research, that is, they are part of a research
group, dependent on funding and, consequently, on strict compliance with
regulatory procedures, with more intense interfaces with the university and
with society â€“ issues that tend to be mitigated in
TCCs.
