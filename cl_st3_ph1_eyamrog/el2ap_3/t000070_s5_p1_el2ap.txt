The time intervals established in seed collections (DAA), according to
the maturation and viability curve, allowed the analyzes entrenched in
this work, as well as enabled its use in protocols
for multiplication and generation of nodular cultures (Guerra & Dal
Vesco 2010, Dal Vesco et al. 2014a). The water content
in the seeds of V. reitzii, appraised in the present
work, revealed the occurrence of a natural desiccation process, which
is directly related to its degree of physiological maturity. Starting
with this factor, it can be inferred that the seeds
of this species have a characteristic orthodox behaviour. In these
species, the seed moisture tends to reduce as the seeds
pass through the maturation process in the mother plant, resulting
in natural desiccation and conceding tolerance to artificial desiccation (Dousseau
et al. 2011). Although the water content can be a
variable when classifying orthodox seeds, Engelmann & Dussert (2000) report
that the moisture content must remain between 10 to 20%.
Walters (2015) indicate that the water content must be below
0.1 g H2O g-1 at the time of conservation, which
requires to be achieved by artificial desiccation. Thus, the hypothesis
that the seeds of V. reitzii are to be contained
in the orthodox category with regards to the percentage of
moisture as laid out by these authors, is corroborated.
