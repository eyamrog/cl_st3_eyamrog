Third, the presence of cheating species in mutualistic networks may
lead to the reorganization of network patterns due to the
increased trait dissimilarity. We found that cheating leads to increased
modularity and reduced nestedness in mutualistic networks. The emergence of
modularity was also observed as an outcome of coevolutionary dynamics
in antagonistic networks and depends on the selection intensity between
victim and cheater species (Andreazzi et al. 2017). Our results
propose an alternative path to the emergence of modularity in
mutualistic networks, which depends on how much cheating interactions the
mutualistic networks support. The structure of interaction networks is explained
by several factors, such as species abundance distribution (DÃ¡tillo et
al. 2014), mismatch between traits of plants and animals (Stang
et al. 2007) and phylogenetic and phenology-based constraints (Jordano 1995,
Jordano et al. 2003). Here we show that cheating interactions
could also change the structure of mutualistic networks through the
coevolutionary process. Future studies could test the influence of cheating
interactions in cascading co-extinctions in mutualistic networks.
