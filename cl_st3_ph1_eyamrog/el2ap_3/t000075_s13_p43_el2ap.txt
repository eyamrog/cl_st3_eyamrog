Chart 1 categorizes the effectiveness of CFMs based on the
selection of papers analyzed here. To simplify the exposition, CFMs
have the following goals: 1) to stretch the maturity of
external liabilities, 2) to increase monetary policy autonomy, 3) to
reduce the gross volume of capital flows, 4) to reduce
the net volume of capital flows, 5) to counter pressure
on nominal exchange rate appreciation, and 6) to counter credit
booms. Additionally, in the classification, a Null/Low effectiveness is attributed
to studies that find that only one (or none) of
the CFMs’ goals were reached, while a Medium/High effectiveness refers
to the studies that find that at least two of
the CFMs’ goals were reached.
