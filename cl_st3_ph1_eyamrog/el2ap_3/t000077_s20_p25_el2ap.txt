Regarding age, the models indicate that the probability of remote
work is higher for the workers aged 16 to 19
years, except when comparing to those aged 60 to 65.
Although the marginal effects related to age are of small
magnitude, this result is noteworthy for, at first glance, contrasting
with those of Figure 3. Younger workers are somewhat more
likely to work remotely than older workers when all other
observable characteristics are the same (Table 3) – although young
worker's participation in remote work was lower than for other
age categories, when the other attributes are not controlled (Figure
3). As pointed out in Yasenov (2020) and Gallacher and
Hossain (2020), the lower participation of young workers in remote
work, compared to the total number of young workers, must
be related to the fact that young people are concentrated
in jobs that are less possible to be performed from
home. Indeed, 41% of workers aged 16-19 were performing the
following types of work, all with a very low remote
work share: store salesman, farmer/gardener, office clerk, bricklayer and others
and production assistant – see Figure 1. In addition, only
1.2% of young workers worked in the public sector. Therefore,
the result in Figure 3 reflects the sorting of young
workers in certain occupations, and not an age effect.
