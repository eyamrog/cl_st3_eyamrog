The ingestion of ayahuasca has gained popularity in recent decades,
acquiring in some areas an ethno-tourism interest, and even creating
spiritual movements around its consumption, such as those called Santo
Daime, União do Vegetal, Barquinha and others (Domínguez et al.
2016). The cultural connotation of the ayahuasca ceremony is undeniable,
and in its original form it is considered as a
cleansing of the body and spirit, as well as a
connection with astral forces. Western science has found the explanation
for the hallucinations it produces: Psychotria viridis contains dimethyltryptamine (DMT),
a substance with powerful hallucinogenic effects; under normal conditions, the
organism inhibits the metabolism of this substance in the intestine,
but the β-carbolines contained in Banisteriopsis caapi in turn counteract
this inhibition, with which DMT reaches the central nervous system
(Escobar 2015). The concoction has shown antidepressant properties (Sanches et
al. 2016; Bouso & Sánchez 2020).
