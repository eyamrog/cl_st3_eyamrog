Linyphiidae was represented by 101 individuals, 47 (46.52%) of these
collected in FA and 27 (26.74%) in each of the
other areas, although the difference was not obtained in the
ANOVA test (F-value = 1,274; P-value = 0,346). During the
cold and dry period (April to September), Linyphiidae was collected
mostly in FA and IA, the Shapiro-Wilk test showed normality
of data in the distribution and no significant difference was
obtained in the ANOVA test (F-value = 2,121; P-value =
0,201). While in the rainy period (October to March) it
was collected mostly in DA (Figure 6), the Shapiro-Wilk test
showed significant difference (W-test = 0,7500; P-value = 0,00000000000000002), but
this difference it was not recovered in the Kruskal-Wallis test
and in the Dunn post-hoc, prepared for the Bonferroni method.
