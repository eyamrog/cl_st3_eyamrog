In other words, if ownership by university does conduce to
endogeneity in scientific journals, this effect is being countered by
LILACS’ inclusion criteria. Of note, the present study had the
ORCID id for some authors, which ought to increase both
concentration indexes in comparison to just using the authors’ names.
Furthermore, LILACS measures endogeny more directly, as the proportion of
reviewers and editors from the same institution or geographic region,
while the present study used more indirect measures. It is
perhaps a testament to the effectiveness of the LILACS criteria
that their effects are seen even when success is measured
differently than LILACS itself measures it. Researchers interested in measuring
the effect on endogeneity of journal ownership by universities might
have to do so in nascent journals not yet indexed
in LILACS.
