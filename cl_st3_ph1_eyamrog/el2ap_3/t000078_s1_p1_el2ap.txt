Theoretical models concerned with multiple centers have been brought to
the debate on sprawling urban employment. However, empirical methods that
identify these centers are not a specific focus of the
specialized literature. The purpose of this paper is to apply
a new empirical methodology in the identification and characterization of
urban employment subcenters (Small Business Districts, SBD) using the case
of the Municipality of SÃ£o Paulo. To this end, we
adopted a two-step approach, developing: 1) Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis
and 2) Spatial Hedonic Price Model. As a result, we
found seven regions that can be considered SBDs.
