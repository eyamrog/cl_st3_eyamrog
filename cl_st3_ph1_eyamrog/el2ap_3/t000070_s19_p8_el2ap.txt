The aleurone layer that surrounds the endosperm and the embryo
is presented in a single layer of cells, of a
thick wall, with the presence of acid polysaccharides in the
cytoplasm and cell wall (figure 1c, see arrow). Concurrent, there
was an absence of starch grains in the cytoplasm of
the aleurone layer.
