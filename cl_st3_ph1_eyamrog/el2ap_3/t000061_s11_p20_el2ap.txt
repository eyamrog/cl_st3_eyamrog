The process triggered by the first mimesis is fundamental for
the construction of moral behavior in Adorno. For the author,
morality is based on an impulse to prevent suffering (Adorno,
2009). In the first moment of mimetic behavior, in which
there is an indifference between the subject and nature, it
is possible to establish feelings of contiguity, familiarity and, especially,
solidarity with the suffering of the other: “The impulse, the
naked and raw physical fear and the feeling of solidarity
with bodies torturous, to use Brecht's expression, the impulse that
is immanent to moral behavior [...]” (Adorno, 2009: 238).
