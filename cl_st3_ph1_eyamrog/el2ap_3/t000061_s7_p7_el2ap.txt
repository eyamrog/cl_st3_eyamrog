Based on the central characteristic of USR – moving training
from a closer relationship between a qualified researcher and a
research beginner – mimesis presents itself as a powerful and
adequate theoretical category for thinking about the problem of ethical
training in research, because, as will be argued, in this
type of educational relationship, more than a mere technique, the
learning of a practical practice in research is encouraged, which
also involves ethical research. In this way, having USR as
a stage and the category of mimesis as a theoretical
construct in the elaboration of arguments, especially from the works
of Adorno and Benjamin, it is intended to reinforce the
importance of the moral formation of beginners in scientific practice,
in a context of regulation of research.
