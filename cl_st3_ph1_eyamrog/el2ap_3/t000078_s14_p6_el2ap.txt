To avoid omitted variables, we consider the global effect (direct
effect + indirect effect) by estimating spatial econometric models that
control these kinds of amenities. According to Can (1992) and
Campos and Almeida (2018), two effects can be identified in
the decomposition of real estate prices. The first is the
effect due to the property's characteristics, and the second is
the spatial spillover effect of those composing its neighborhood. Therefore,
in terms of econometric analysis, we are interested in the
global effect results.
