Our discrete-time, evolutionary model describes how the average trait of
a species i, Zi, evolves due to selection imposed by
ecological interactions and other environmental factors (e.g., abiotic conditions). In
our model, the selection differential, S, and the additive genetic
variance of the trait governs trait change across generations (Lande
1976). We assumed S has three components potentially affecting the
evolution of the trait Z: the selection imposed by (i)
mutualisms, (ii) cheating interactions, and (iii) other environmental factors. As
a first approximation, we assume that, for a given interaction,
species are either mutualistic partners or cheaters, but the same
species may behave as a cheater for species j but
as a mutualistic partner to species k.
