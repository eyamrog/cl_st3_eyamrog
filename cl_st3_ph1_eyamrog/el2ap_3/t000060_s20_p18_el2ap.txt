Pragmatically speaking, like tag questions, we consider questions that end
with the discourse markers correct and right as devices which
have the same illocutionary force. Other examples that illustrate this
are found in Excerpts 1 and 2, respectively, when Mr.
Martinez says “So... after two o’CLOCK... that... you... took everything
and put it down in the car correct?” and “it
was at two specifically it was around two o’clock when
you actually put the luggage in the car right?”. Relying
on Gibbons (2003, p. 95), Holt and Johnson (2010, p.
25) show two objectives that questions can have in legal
settings: “1. eliciting information and 2. obtaining conﬁrmation of a
version of events that the questioner has in mind”. Our
examples under analysis seem to constitute devices with the latter
objective.
