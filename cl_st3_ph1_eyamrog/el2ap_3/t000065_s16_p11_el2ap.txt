The greatest number of samples in the corpus comes from
students enrolled in courses from the following areas: Physical Sciences
and Engineering and Biological and Health Sciences. Humanities and Arts,
on the other hand, constitute the discipline area with the
smallest number of samples (see Figure 2). This corpus characteristic
is very likely due to the total number of students
from Humanities and Arts and Social Sciences and Education enrolled
in English for Academic Purposes disciplines being considerably lower than
those in the Biological and Hard Sciences fields.
