Based on a textual-interactive approach to the spoken language, this
study lies at the interface between conversation analysis and forensic
linguistics. In the same vein, we hope, above all, to
encourage the development of further analyses and reflections that may
contribute to the studies concerning spoken texts in forensic contexts.
