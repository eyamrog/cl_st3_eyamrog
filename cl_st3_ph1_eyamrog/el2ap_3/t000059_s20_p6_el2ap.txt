In comparison to journals indexed in LILACS, those indexed in
MEDLINE had a lower proportion of articles by the most
prolific author (median 2.9%, 95th percentile 10.6%) and a higher
Gini coefficient (median 0.183, 95th percentile 0.355), as described by
Scanff and colleagues (2021). However, after reweighting MEDLINE journals, both
authorship concentration indexes in MEDLINE became virtually identical to those
in LILACS (Table 1).
