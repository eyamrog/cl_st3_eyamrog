Finally, there is a latent discourse of free democracy, invoked
by the appreciation “wir wissen um die Stärke freier Demokratien”,
which unites “us”. This discourse is connected to the Putin’s
war discourse by labelling the attack on Ukraine an attack
on the peaceful order in Europe and the world and
another mention of “Putin’s war”. The final sentence, the announcement
that “wir werden es verteidigen” (‘we will defend it’), is
another invocation of the Germany as military power discourse.
