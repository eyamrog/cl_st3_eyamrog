The three Brazilian professors that planned the workshop invited young
professionals4 from different areas to join the workshop as guests.
Some of them were living abroad, so they could genuinely
answer the question addressed in the workshop What can young
professionals do? The other participants, mostly their college students who
were intermediate learners of English, would take part in a
play session. It would be quite different from their learning
experience in class because, compared to their space of language
practice, they would have more freedom and could take risks.
