Worldwide, the current pandemic has caused the largest economic dislocation
since the Great Depression (Campello et al., 2020). Because this
is an unprecedented health and economic crisis, there is a
new and rapidly growing literature dedicated to assessing the effects
of Covid-19. Jonas (2013) points out possible demand and supply
shocks associated with pandemics: avoidance reactions and measures of social
distancing can lead to rapid and significant negative demand shocks
and supply disruptions; contagion itself has direct and indirect costs,
leading to loss of production due to death and illness
of workers and other absenteeism related to the disease; and
cascade impacts when these effects are combined.
