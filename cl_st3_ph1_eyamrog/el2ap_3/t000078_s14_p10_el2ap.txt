After controlling property prices for intrinsic characteristics, amenities, and access
to transportation, we assumed that the distance of each property
to each SBD suggested by the first stage should be
statistically significant and with negative signs to be considered sub-centers.
This identification strategy allows making inferences about the SBD and
evaluating if the econometric model of hedonic prices of the
real estate market behaves as predicted by the theoretical models.
