However, despite some mainstream economists started to defend the use
of capital controls and macroprudential policies aimed at similar objectives
to those defended by Keynesian economists, our study suggests that
their respective theoretical basis still differ from each other. From
the Keynesian/Structuralist tradition, the main rationale for the use of
capital controls resides in the inherent asymmetry of the contemporaneous
International Monetary and Financial System, in which the volatility of
capital flows and its negative side effects derive greatly from
the existence of a ‘currency hierarchy’. The theoretical reorientation that
has been taking place under orthodoxy, in turn, is mainly
based on the notion of correction of externalities and, therefore,
its research method focuses greatly on individual agents and their
responses to government interventions.
