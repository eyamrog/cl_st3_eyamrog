Imagination, as the ability to create mental images, is favored
by the archaic ability to read “the things themselves before
the word are an object of reading” (Freitas, 2008: 365).
It is important to clarify that Benjamin uses the archaic
term referring both to "the origin of humanity and history
[as to] the period of learning the world and socialization
of the child in the process of educational for adult
life" (Schlesener, 2019: 256). In both cases, imitation is intentionally
produced with a view to insertion in the world.
