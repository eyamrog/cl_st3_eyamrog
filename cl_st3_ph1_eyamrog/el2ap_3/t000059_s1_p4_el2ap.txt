Conclusions: LILACS inclusion criteria are effectively countering any pro-endogeneity effect
ownership by universities might have on regional journals. Journal evaluation
should mind journal size when examining authorship concentration indexes. Formal
derivation of their relationship with journal size would allow more
precise interpretation of such indexes.
