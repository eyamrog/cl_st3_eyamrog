It is worth mentioning that the original study found 6
factors by applying only the exploratory factor analysis (EFA), while
in the present study, in addition to the EFA, we
also performed the CFA, with a good fit for structural
equation models and good reliability evaluated by Cronbach's α and
McDonald's ω coefficients.
