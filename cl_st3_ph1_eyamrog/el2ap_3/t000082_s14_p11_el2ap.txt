We characterized the coevolutionary dynamics by describing patterns in trait
distributions across species. We first measure the average trait distance
between species as a proxy for trait disparity in the
network. We computed the mean pairwise distance (D), which is
the sum of the Euclidean distances of species traits between
all possible pairwise combinations between all species divided by the
total number of pairwise combinations (Ciampaglio et al. 2001): <>
to characterize the trait matching generated by the coevolutionary dynamics,
we used Ward's hierarchical clustering analysis (Ward 1963) along with
the GAP validation index, a pre analysis of the clustering
algorithm for evaluating the optimized number of clusters in a
given dataset (Tibshirani et al. 2001). We used this approach
to compute the number of trait clusters between interacting species.
