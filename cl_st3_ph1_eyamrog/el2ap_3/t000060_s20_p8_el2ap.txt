When Martinez says “pardon?”, it does not seem to be
just a hearing problem (because she said in a very
clear and loud voice), but a persuasive strategy as he
might intend that the witness repeats what she has just
explained to make her to say something that could be
used as incriminating evidence. Then she reformulates her utterance by
changing having sex into otherwise engaged, which is more polite
and could also be more acceptable to listeners. This device
helps her construct a positive image as it would be
convenient to show the audience (particularly the jury) her civilized
and ladylike side. By means of this paraphrase, she repairs
what might be seen as a negative point and highlights
what she desires to be displayed: to be recognized as
a respectful person. It is what Scollon and Scollon (1983)
denominate “deference politeness” inasmuch as she chose a more polite
and respectful expression than the one she had used previously.
