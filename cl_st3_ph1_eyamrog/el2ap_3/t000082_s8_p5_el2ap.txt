Here, we use a quantitative trait mathematical model, empirical networks
of species interactions, and numerical simulations to investigate how cheaters
interactions may affect coevolution in mutualistic networks. Specifically, we explore
three main questions i) How do different frequencies of cheating
interactions affect coevolutionary dynamics? Due to the arms race dynamics
favored by cheaters coevolution, we expect a higher trait mismatch
in scenarios with elevated frequencies of cheaters interactions. ii) Do
central cheater species amplify the effect of cheaters interactions on
trait evolution? Because central species can influence the trait evolution
of several other species, we expect that central cheater species
will amplify the effect of cheaters interactions on trait evolution
in mutualistic networks. iii) What is the effect of cheating
interactions on the structure of mutualistic networks? By assuming that
cheaters interactions may favor arms race dynamics, one can expect
higher trait matching among species involved in arms races, but
increased trait mismatch with other partners, leading to the loss
of interactions. Thus, we expect that higher frequencies of cheaters
interactions will generate higher arms race dynamics and consequently, higher
frequency of interaction loss, generating networks with higher modularity (Figure
1b).
