More specifically, this activity gave participants a chance to feel
free to share whatever personal fact they wanted with the
group and react to other people’s facts by uncovering their
camera. Such gesture, or lack of it, clearly stated: “I’m
like you”, “I feel you” or “That’s not me”, “I
don’t do that”. In this manner, participants were exposed to
different personal traits and expressed how they were affected and
how those feelings were part of their subjectivity, while sharing
that with others (Sawaia, 2018).
