Regarding the use of I think and I don’t think
in Excerpt 5, we highlight that they have the same
functions already observed in Excerpt 4. This is a mitigation
device as it helps the speaker reduce their responsibility for
upon what they say. The role of this kind of
marker is to mitigate, to protect the speaker’s face as
it reflects, in a subtle way, an opinion semantically full
of ideological values and different goals in the interaction. Markers
such as I think (that), I believe (that), I know,
and it seems to me, for example, apart from presenting
an opinion, have a mitigation value because they not only
reveal the presence of the interlocutor, but also contribute to
reduce the speakers’ responsibility for the opinion they state. When
the Judge says “so the question frames her answers, I
think that it’s appropriate”, for instance, she points out the
reason for sustaining the objection. Since the question is very
objective “what do you do”, not “who was there”, the
defendant has to answer it in a very objective way
as well otherwise it could be objected to. Even though
it is clear that the interrogative pronoun what used in
the question does not accept other answers, she uses the
opinion marker I think to affirm that the objection is
appropriate. It is a strategy that contributes to soften her
responsibility on what she says and, at the same time,
to preserve her positive face as her attitude may be
seem by listeners as a quite fair judgement.
