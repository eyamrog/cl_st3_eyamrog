The models that use a spatial statistical approach are based
on Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA). The methodology allows evaluating
the spatial pattern of employment level and density. Baumont et
al. (2004) identify as sub-centers all high employment levels and
statistically significant densities.
