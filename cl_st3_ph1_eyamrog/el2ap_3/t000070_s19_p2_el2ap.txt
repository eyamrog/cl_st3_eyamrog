The average percentage of seed germination did not present any
statistically significant difference when comparing conservation methods, cryopreserved (78.9%), and
non-cryopreserved (78.3%) (table 1). Therefore, significant differences in the germination
percentages of the seeds were observed in the different DAA.
The highest and most significant (p <0.01) average germination percentage
(89.6%) was observed with seeds collected at 150 DAA (table
1).
