Similarly, Gallacher and Hossain (2020), for Canada, found that 41%
of the country's jobs could be done remotely and that
workers with less chance of remote work were poorer, younger,
non-immigrant, single, male and/or without college education that worked in
the private sector and in small firms and that were
seasonal, contractual or part-time workers.
