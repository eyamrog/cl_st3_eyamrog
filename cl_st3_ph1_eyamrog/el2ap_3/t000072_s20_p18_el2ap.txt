According to the administration of the Guarnição da Aeronáutica de
Pirassununga, there are areas close to the Mogi Guaçu River
in the Pirassununga Municipality that need to be restored (S.M.
Barroso, personal communication). Therefore, we compared the species cataloged in
the present study with the List of Species Specified for
Ecological Restoration for Various Regions of the State of São
Paulo (Barbosa 2017) and 18 of the species here reported
are indicated for ecological restoration. This indicates that the studied
fragment may come to be used as a source of
propagules for degraded areas, which may be either by marking
seed trees for collecting seeds, and later, by creating seedlings,
or by transposing soil and or litter (Brancalion et al.
2015).
