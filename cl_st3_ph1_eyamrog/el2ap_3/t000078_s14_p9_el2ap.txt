Thus, the first stage evaluates the tract areas that form
statistically significant clusters by using the ESDA approach. The validation
of the tract areas as SBD stems from the hedonic
price model. In this second stage, the identification strategy considers
real estate in space for each year. The amenities (schools,
parks, hospitals, etc.) and transportation (subway, train, access to the
avenues and roads) were also geocoded. The geocoded data allows
a) to identify the location of the properties, amenities, and
transportation in the city, b) to calculate the Euclidean distance
of each property to the public amenities and transportation within
the municipality.
