Data from 45 individuals of one new species, 10 individuals
of the other and 10 individuals of Bagrobdella parauchenoglanii, were
subjected to a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This analysis was
done using the FactoMineR (Husson et al. 2020) and factoextra
(Kassambara & Mundt 2020) packages in R. Bagrobdella auchenoglanii, B.
fraudulenta and B. anthopenis, each one represented by the mean
values of the analyzed parameters obtained in Euzet and Le
Brun (1990) were added to the analysis as supplementary individuals.
