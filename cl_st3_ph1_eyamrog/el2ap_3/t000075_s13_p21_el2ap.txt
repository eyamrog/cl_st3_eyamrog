After finding evidences of the effectiveness of capital controls in
reducing the volume of portfolio fluxes to Brazil over the
sample period, the authors also investigate whether there were spillover
effects to other countries in response to the Brazilian government’s
regulatory measures. The regression to investigate this hypothesis highlights positive
indications, such as positive spillovers (an increase in investors’ positions)
to countries in the same region (Latin America), to countries
that have financial markets similar to that of Brazil, and
to big exporters to China. On the other hand, there
were negative spillovers (a reduction in investors’ positions) to countries
seen as ‘susceptible’ to impose capital controls (Forbes et al.,
2016). These results are then extremely important in the debate
on the multilateral aspects of capital controls, since there is
a risk that these regulations can become a new ‘impoverish
the neighborhood’ policy.
