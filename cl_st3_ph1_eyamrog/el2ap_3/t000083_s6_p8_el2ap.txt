Among those with selfitis's severe levels, the scores were on
"social competition" and "attention seeking" factors. The social competition can
be related to numerous behaviors, from compulsive gambling to substance
use (Balakrishnan and Griffiths (2017). In the present study, the
"social competition" factor had the second highest mean (3.45) among
the 5 factors, indicating it is one of the factors
most related to selfitis's severe behavior. That is, it seems
that in selfitis's severe levels, sharing selfies, in different poses,
waiting for "likes" and comments, and using image editing resources,
are the most relevant aspects. The same for the "attention
seeking" factor which achieved the highest average (4.02). People who
score in this factor are those who are attention seekers
on social networks, seek "likes" and positive feedbacks, seek to
feel more popular, compete for attention, popularity and feedback, and
invest time in editing images to be shared. Indeed, positive
feedback to a post can reinforce self-confidence, fulfilling the individual's
expectations (Boursier & Manna, 2018). It is worth noting that
attention seeking can also be a narcissistic component (Khan &
Imran, 2019; McCain et al., 2016). According to Gnambs (2017)
there is a solid positive relationship between self-promoting selfies shared
on social media and levels of narcissism. In other words,
"attention seeking" is a factor that has been shown to
be quite associated with selfitis's severe levels, corroborating the studies
conducted by Balakrishnan and Griffiths (2017) and Seidman (2013). According
to Haggard (2014) people are more concerned with showing the
moment being lived than actually living it, as in a
constant search for attention.
