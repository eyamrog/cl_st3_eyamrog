This species can negatively impact plant populations such as Cucumis
sativus L. and animals like Formicivora paludicola Buzzetti et al.
2014 (Rodrigues & Lopes 2006, Del-Rio 2014). In addition to
the rapid propagation of the species, the plant does not
have a known effective predator. However, Castro (2013) presented the
first herbivore record, inserting the H. coronarium in the food
chain of Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris Linnaeus 1766.
