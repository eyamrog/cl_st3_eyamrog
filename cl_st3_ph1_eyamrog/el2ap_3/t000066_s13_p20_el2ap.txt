In that direction, Marx (1980, XVI, p. 378), when explaining
the importance of collective work, affirms that the worker gets
rid of the “limits of their individuality and develops the
capacity of their species”. The social contact in a specific
activity pushes participants to move toward a common goal, which
enhances their capability of acting and achieving better results than
they would, should group members act individually (Spinoza, 2003).
