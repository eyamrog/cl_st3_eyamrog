In other words, during the inserted sequence the original question
retains its transition relevance, and if the second speaker does
not then produce an answer it is noticeably absent in
exactly the same way as it would be if there
were no intervening sequence, and the questioner can complain about
the lack of an answer in exactly the same way.
Thus the argument is that adjacency pairs are normative structures,
the second part ought to occur, and for this reason
the other sequences can be regarded as being inserted between
the first pair part that has occurred and the second
pair part that is anticipated.
