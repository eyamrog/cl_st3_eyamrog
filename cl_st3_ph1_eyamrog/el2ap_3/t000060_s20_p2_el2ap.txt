In the excerpts, the sentences that will be analysed are
given in italics. The first three excerpts were taken from
the final day of Jodi Ann Arias’s cross-examination (Day 25):
Juan Martinez was the deputy county attorney, Kirk Nurmi and
Jennifer Willmott worked for the defendant, and Sherry K. Stephens
was the judge. The remaining excerpts were obtained from the
reporter’s transcript of proceedings.
