For its part, Cabells International was generous enough to undertake
a comparison of PKP’s list of journals with those in
Predatory Reports by matching the journal’s ISSNs (International Standard Serial
Number) across the two lists. Limiting the match to journals
with ISSNs reduced Cabells’ list to 7,490 titles (out of
15,470) and the PKP’s to 22,802 (out of 25,671). Within
this set, 237 journals appeared on both lists, representing 3.2
percent of Cabells list (with ISSNs), and 1.0 percent of
the journals using OJS (with ISSNs).
