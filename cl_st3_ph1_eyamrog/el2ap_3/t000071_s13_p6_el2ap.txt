While Beall did not specify the reasons that individual publishers
or journals were added to his list, Cabells Predatory Reports
(2021) identifies the “violations” for each title, ranking them from
“severe” to “minor.” Cabells’ “60+ behavioral indicators” for journals are
described as indicative of “misconduct,” “fraudulent operations,” and “probable threats”
(Cabells, n.d.). For the journals using OJS in its list,
Cabells identified 4.3 violations, on average, per journal. The most
common violation was that the journal failed to possess or
post a policy for digital preservation. This “moderate” violation is
included for 107 or 45.1 percent of the journals using
OJS (Table 2). For each of the publishers that had
one or more journals in Cabells Predatory Reports, we prepared
an email for publisher and editors that listed their violations.
After all, it would be very unlikely that they would
otherwise have access to this list. We also included our
recommendations for addressing these concerns and the method of notifying
Cabells of the corrections that they may have made to
their journals. For the most common violation, for example, we
recommended that the publisher sign up their journals for the
PKP Preservation Network, available to all journals using OJS and
post this as their preservation policy. As the emailing of
the publishers was only completed at the point at which
we submitted this chapter for publication, we are not in
a position to report on its success in helping the
publishers.
