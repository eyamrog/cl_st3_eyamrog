Analyzing the official ANUIES reportsâ€™ databases we found that first
year enrollment for natural sciences, math and statistics in the
2020-2021 school year (32,095) was lower than the total number
of applications received (82,214) but also lower than the available
spots (45,608), resulting in a 70.4% coverage of the places
offered. Similarly, the first year enrollment in health sciences for
the 2020- 2021 school year (126,132) was lower than the
total number of applications received (438,284) but also lower than
the spots available (180,423) for entry, resulting in a 69.9%
of coverage of places offered. The disparity between demand and
supply, along with other variables, resulted in a 2020-2021 first
year enrollment of 126,132 students for health sciences (a decrease
of 6.1% from the previous school year) and 32,095 for
natural sciences, math and statistics (an increase of 3.9% from
the previous school year). Both the supply of places and
the demand in applications have increased in these fields over
time (2011-2021). (Fig. 5.b)
