The Moranâ€™s I test is used to verify the existence
of spatial dependence in OLS model residuals. It follows the
empirical approach Halleck Vega and Elhorst (2015) proposed, focusing on
the models that consider the spatial lag of the explanatory
variables (SLX). According to Gibbons and Overman (2012) and Halleck
Vega and Elhorst (2015), the SLX model should start when
the assessment requires a spatial econometric approach. The SLX model
is the most flexible of all spatial specifications, although it
faces some disadvantages, such as multicollinearity and causality interpretation difficulties.
It is easily interpretable in terms of signal, magnitude, and
level of significance. Besides, it also avoids all the criticisms
that fall into the models of global spillover when estimating
SDM, SDEM, or GNS type models (Halleck Vega and Elhorst,
2015).
