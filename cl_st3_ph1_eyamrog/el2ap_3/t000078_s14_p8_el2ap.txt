As these results are sensitive to different weight matrices, robustness
tests on the spatial matrix will be considered below, seeking
internal validity for the results found. As for the robustness
of the weight matrix, we permit 5% and 10% distance,
increasing the initial cut-off, permitting bigger neighborhoods.
