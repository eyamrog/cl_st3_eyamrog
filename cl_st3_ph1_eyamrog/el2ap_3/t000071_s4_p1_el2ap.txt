No one doubts that unscrupulous website operators are present in
scholarly publishing, much as they are in other fields. Without
denying this reality, this study joins others in demonstrating how
the lack of transparency at important points in the scholarly
publishing process can lead to an over-application of the predatory
label to journals and publishers. While this may increase awareness
of a real problem, it threatens the progress that open
access is making in the emergence of a greater global
research effort. Nowhere is this more apparent than the industry’s
current response with “Think. Check. Submit.” While it is aimed
at assisting authors considering where best to submit their work,
it cannot help but foster a broader distrust of the
research literature beyond familiar and recognized publications.
