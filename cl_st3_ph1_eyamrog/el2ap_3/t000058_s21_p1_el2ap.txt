Throughout the years of dedicated to research into culicid fauna
in the state of Paraná, several works were published by
Dr. Ana Leuch Lozovei and her group, [2,3,17,34,50–52], reinforcing the
importance of culicids in the transmission of diseases and in
environmental quality. Moreover, it was possible to carry out this
work through the data obtained.
