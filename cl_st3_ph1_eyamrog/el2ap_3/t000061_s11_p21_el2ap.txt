Considering the characteristics of USR, it is possible to affirm
that it is an entry ritual into the academic environment.
In this sense, the word itself initiation means more than
simply the act of starting something, it also carries with
it the notions that it is a rite, an experiential
activity. The meaning of initiation, according to the Houaiss dictionary
(2020), is: “The act of giving or receiving the first
elements of a practice or the rudiments relating to an
area of knowledge. Ex.: initiation scientific”. In USR, the student
is “initiated in the science 'game' and experiences linked to
a research project, designed and developed under the guidance of
a professor” (Massi and Queiroz, 2010: 175).
