The fish fauna of Lake Tanganyika has received particular attention
from evolutionary biologists, mostly because of its phenotypically, ethologically and
genetically highly diverse cichlid fauna which consider it as a
‘natural laboratory’ (Martens 1997, Langenberg et al. 2003, Albrecht &
Wilke 2008, Cristescu et al. 2010). Indeed, its cichlid species
are phenotypically, ethically and genetically highly diverse (Nishida 1991, Salzburger
et al. 2002, 2005), they show the highest degree of
endemism compared to other great lakes in Africa and the
Americas (Salzburger et al. 2014), with 239 endemic species out
of the 241 described (an endemism rate of 99%) (Ronco
et al. 2020, 2021). In addition to evolutionists, Lake Tanganyika
Cichlids have also attracted the attention of parasitologists primarily in
host biogeography, systematics and parasite evolution (e.g. Bates, 1997, Grégoir
et al. 2014, Pariselle et al. 2011, 2015, Raeymaekers et
al. 2013, Steenberge et al. 2015, Vanhove et al., 2013,
2015, 2016).
