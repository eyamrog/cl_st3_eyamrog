Among the 11 studied host specimens, the most parasitized was
the one caught at the Mouth of Mutambala River. This
individual hosted a total of 286 Monogeneans, 269 Bagrobdella vanhovei
and 17 B. vansteenbergei. The other ten individuals that were
captured off the Orthodox Church of Uvira possessed only Bagrobdella
vanhovei individuals. Among them, four had no monogeneans, three had
one individual, and the other three hosts had, five, six
and 35 individuals respectively. This non-homogeneous distribution is very common
in populations of parasite from host fishes (Dold & Holland
2011), for example it has been observed very recently in
the Brachyplatystoma vaillantii Valenciennes, 1840 (Siluriformes, Pimelodidae) in the Amazon
(Brito-Junior & Tavares-Dias 2021).
