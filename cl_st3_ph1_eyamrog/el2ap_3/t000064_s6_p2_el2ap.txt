The light intensity effect on photosynthetic aspects of Vellozia leaves
has been more frequently evaluated by the electron transport rate.
In several species of Vellozia, this rate is maximal under
photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) intensities of about 2,100 µmol.m-2.s-1, which
is coincident to the values commonly found in Cerrado, i.e.
ca. 1,800 to 2,200 µmol.m-2.s-1 at midday (Lüttge et al.
2007). As for a comparison, the maximal electron transport rate
of Smilax goyazana, a common shrub of Cerrado, occurs at
about half of the maximal PAR of the environment (Palhares
et al. 2011).
