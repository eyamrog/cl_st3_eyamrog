It is noted that the CBD coefficient is not statistically
significant for any of the functional forms (Table 4, columns
1-2). By controlling the model by the quadratic effect of
CBD distancing, the coefficient signals diverge from the theoretical models
and are not statistically significant (Table 4, columns 3-4). Two
possibilities may justify these results: a) spatial dependence may be
distorting the signals and/or tests and/or b) omission of (a)
relevant variable(s) (SBD), in which case the city of SÃ£o
Paulo would be polycentric.
