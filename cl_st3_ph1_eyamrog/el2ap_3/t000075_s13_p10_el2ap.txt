Ghosh et al. (2014) analyze the main determinants and magnitudes
of net financial flux surges such that their innovation was
to distinguish between the surges due to foreign investors and
those due to the behavior of domestic investors. In other
words, they differentiate between liability-driven and asset-driven surges, respectively.5 Some
regressions showed that external factors had a superior explanatory power
relative to domestic factors, in terms of the probability of
a surge, which explains the strong synchrony of this phenomenon
between emerging markets. The liability-driven surges, besides being predominant in
the probability of an occurrence, were the most sensitive to
changes in external factors, the contagion effect, and the degree
of financial interconnection. To the extent of this evidence, Ghosh
et al. (2014) defend the use of capital controls to
avoid a strong volatility in this surge category, as well
coordination policies between emerging economies that receive these financial fluxes
and advanced countries that are the source of such capital
outflows.
