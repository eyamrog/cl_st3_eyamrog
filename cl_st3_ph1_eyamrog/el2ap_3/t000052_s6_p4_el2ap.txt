Except for individuals of Auchenoglanis occidentalis sampled by Euzet and
Le Brun in Bamako (Niger River), which harbor three species
of Bagrobdella (B. auchenoglanii, B. fraudulenta and B. anthopenis), in
other localities: Lake Albert, Uganda (Paperna 1971); Kara River, Togo
(Kritsky & Kulo 1999); Oti River (Euzet & Le Brun
1990) and Volta Lake (Paperna 1969), Volta Basin; Sassandra in
RCI (Euzet & Le Brun 1990), and on Parauchenoglanis monkei
in Cameroon (Akoumba et al. 2017), it seems that only
one species is present (B. fraudulenta in Uganda, B. parauchenoglanii
in Cameroon, B. auchenoglanii in the other localities).
