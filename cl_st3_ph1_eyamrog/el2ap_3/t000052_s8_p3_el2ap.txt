The non-cichlids of Lake Tanganyika, less diversified than the Cichlidae,
have attracted very little attention of scientists. However, they are
represented by 75 species belonging to 11 families, and have
a rate of endemicity of 59 %. It is true
that species of some of these families, such as Clupeidae
and Latidae, have already been the subject of some ecological
(Coulter 1976, Mannini et al. 1999), parasitological (Kmentova et al.
2018, Kmentova et al. 2020) and genomic (De Keyzer et
al. 2019) studies. However, the Siluriformes, while representing on their
own 5 (Bagridae, Claroteidae, Clariidae, Mochokidae and Malapteruridae) of these
11 families, making Lake Tanganyika the most diverse lake in
Siluriformes than any other lake in the world (Fermon 2007,
Peart et al. 2014), have been totally left behind. Thus,
the present study set out to investigate the Monogenea of
the latter group.
