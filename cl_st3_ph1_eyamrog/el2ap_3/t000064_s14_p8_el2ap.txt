Statistical analysis - The light response curves were adjusted to
the model of Prado & Moraes (1997): Ameas = Amax
(1- e-k(PAR-Lcp)), in which Ameas means carbon assimilation rate under
a given light intensity; Amax means the maximal carbon assimilation
rate measured; k is a constant calculated for each curve;
PAR means the given light intensity and Lcp means the
light compensation point. Data were compared via StudentÂ´s T-test with
the support of the open access graph software Libre Office.
