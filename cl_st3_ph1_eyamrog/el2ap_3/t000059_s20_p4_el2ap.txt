The median Gini coefficient was 0.149, with a 95th percentile
of 0.310 (1). No journal had an outstandingly high Gini
coefficeint (panel B from Figure 1), but one journal (√Ågora,
with 91 signed articles) had a coefficient of zero. The
journal had an average of two authors per article, and
no author published more than one article during the study
period. As in Scanff and colleagues (2021), the coefficient was
higher on average but somewhat less varying for journals with
more articles (panel B in Figure 1).
