Focusing on Brazil, the fifth-largest country in the world, with
an urban population concentration of 84% in cities, 43 million
inhabitants live within just 17 citiesa and produce 34.7% of
the Brazilian GDP (IBGE). Regarding the Municipality of São Paulo,
11.446 million inhabitants live within an area of 1,512 km²
and, in 2014, the GDP of the MSP was US$
237 billion; which was roughly 11.7% of the national GDP,
ranking the city as the richest one among all municipalities
in the country (SEADE, 2017). Meyer, Grostein, and Biderman (2004)
pointed out the employment paths over the districts of São
Paulo (MSP). Since the 1960s, service sectors have moved from
the old center (Sé district) towards the west and south.
Initially, such concentration was observed in the Jardim Paulista and
then in the Cerqueira Cezar and Itaim Bibi districts. The
latter received many firms due to the construction of the
Faria Lima Avenue in the 1970s, which became one of
the most important city avenues. From 1970 to 1990, employment
sprawling continued toward the Vila Olimpia neighborhood, following Luis Carlos
Berrini Avenue. Recently, 2000-2010, the firms are spreading toward the
far south of the city and the west of the
city zone (see Table 1).
