In our analysis of the 14 publishers and two standalone
journals, we discovered that seven of the publishers (or 14
percent of the publishers randomly chosen at the outset) did
not charge authors for publication, which basically disqualifies them from
the Beall and Cabells characterization of “predatory.” Two of the
seven sold subscriptions to their journals, and five had neither
subscriptions nor author charges. In addition, we checked the entire
set for compliance with what we judged to be eight
key criteria from among Beall’s set (2015), to which we
added DOAJ and Google Scholar listings (Table 1). For those
that charged authors, only one publisher (Fundamental Journals) did not
comply with seven or more of the 10 scholarly standards.
