The results of the descriptive analysis showed that, in the
months from May to August 2020, the subgroups of workers
with the smallest participation (within their own subgroups) in remote
work were the poorest, males, rural residents, non-whites, youngest (16
to 19 years old), without college education, self-employed or salaried
workers from the private sector and agriculture workers.
