In the Critical Collaborative Research (PCcol) (Magalh√£es, 2009) perspective, this
movement is understood as intervention in practice, in which the
participants involved are active in the production of knowledge. Also,
PCcol highlights voluntary engagement, promotes critical participation and brings multiple
voices to the research context. These multiple voices in collaboration
trigger contradictions and tensions, which are essential to unleash critical
reflection and possible transformations to the context. The confrontations that
operate in the world of social relations can be justified
in and by language, which is the central issue in
AL studies. This collaborative perspective highlights an engaged attitude through
shared work, built by the sum of efforts of those
involved.
