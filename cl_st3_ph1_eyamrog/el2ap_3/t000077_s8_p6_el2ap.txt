Considering the difficulty of carrying out jobs that involve face-to-face
contact – due to the Covid-19 spread characteristics – or
the government definitions about essential activities, the central question behind
the results is whether or not it is possible to
do the job remotely. Yasenov (2020), Gallacher and Hossain (2020),
Crowley and Doran (2020), Brussevich et al., (2020) and Bartik
et al. (2020) focused specifically on this issue, covering the
United States, Ireland, Canada and the Organization for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD) countries. Up until now, the majority of
studies analyzed developed countries. Among the authors who adopted this
focus, we can mention Balde et al. (2020), Estupinan et
al. (2021), Gottlieb et al. (2021) and Khamis et al.
(2021). Although these studies have specificities, there is some convergence
regarding the important inequalities in the probability of remote work,
considering aspects of income, age, education, gender, and employment contract
arrangements, with fewer possibilities for more vulnerable groups in the
labor market.
