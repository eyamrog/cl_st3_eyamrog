Methods: Bibliographic data were obtained from LILACS for systematically indexed
journals with at least 50 signed articles (that is, with
at least one individual author) from 2015 to 2019. Authors
were identified by their name or, when possible, ORCID id.
The PPMP was the number articles by the journalâ€™s most
prolific author, divided by the number of signed articles. The
Gini coefficient counted more than once articles with multiple authors
author. For comparison purposes, MEDLINE data were reweighted to have
the same distribution of journal size (number of signed articles)
as LILACS journals.
