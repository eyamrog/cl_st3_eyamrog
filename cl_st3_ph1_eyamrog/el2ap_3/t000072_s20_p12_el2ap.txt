Among ecological groups, 37.5% were classified as non-pioneers and 30%
as pioneers. The rest of the species were not characterized
according to the ecological group because they are herbaceous (22.5%),
lianas (7.5%) and undetermined (2.5%). As for ecological groups, non-pioneer
species represented the greatest diversity of species, but the largest
number of registered individuals (83.6%) belongs to the group of
pioneer species. According to some authors, most of the species
found in the seed bank of semideciduous forests are pioneering
in relation to ecological succession (Thompson 2000, Braga et al.
2016, Kunz & Martins 2016), as they are species that
persist in the soil for a long time in a
state of dormancy, in addition to high seed production (Martins
et al. 2015). Non- pioneer species do not usually form
a population within the seed bank, because due to their
large size, they cannot penetrate the litter layer and homogenize
with the soil (Martins et al. 2015). Failure to incorporate
large seeds into the soil promotes exposure to predator attacks
(Silva et al. 2019), unlike seeds of pioneer species, which
are buried more easily due to their small size, and
are often protected from potential predators (Thompson 2000). In a
study conducted by Nóbrega et al. (2009), also in the
riparian forest of the Mogi Guaçu river, showed that 47%
of the species that emerged from the seed bank are
pioneers, in contrast to the present study, in which the
emerged pioneers were 30%. In other studies, on the same
phytophysiognomy, most of the emerged species were also characterized as
pioneers (Franco et al. 2012).
