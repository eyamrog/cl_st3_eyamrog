Cabells method of identifying “violations” for each title listed is
a step up from Beall’s method of simply adding publishers
and journals to its list. Yet there remains a reliance
on relatively weak proxies for what may or may not
reflect a lack of experience and professional support. As well,
the trade-off for this gain in detail is that the
journals’ identities, as well as their “violations,” are unlikely to
be available to those listed. This is of concern because
Cabells’ list of violations does helpfully identify ways to improve
the journals. We have suggested to Cabells the basic fairness
of sharing its assessments with the journals designated a “probable
threat.” While Cabells is not prepared to undertake such a
step at this point, we plan to update the company
on the results of our strategy of reaching out to
the publishers with journals in Predatory Reports with advice for
addressing the “violations” attributed to their publications and for seeking
reconsideration. Our hope is that there may yet be a
reason for this company to reconsider its contributions to scholarly
publishing. This approach might also lead to an increased accuracy
of their predatory reports by excluding false positives.
