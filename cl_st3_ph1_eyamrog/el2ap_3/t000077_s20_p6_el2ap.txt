This unequal ability to work from home in different types
of work, position, or function raises concerns about inequality, due
to the systematic difference between these categories with respect to
the representativeness of socially vulnerable groups of workers. The evidence
in Figure 1 preliminarily suggests that low-income workers faced the
difficult decision about employment versus health risks while higher-income workers
were more likely to be able to choose remote work.
To further explore this result, we present Figure 2, the
share of remote work by location in the earnings distribution.
