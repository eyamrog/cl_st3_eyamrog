As for the economic sectors, the results of Crowley and
Doran (2020) for Ireland are that those with less potential
for remote work are: agriculture/forestry/fishing, construction, transportation and storage, and
mining and quarrying. For industries in which these types of
jobs predominate, the workers decision is between stopping production or
taking on the health risk to continue in business, with
no possibility of remote work (Bartik et al., 2020).
