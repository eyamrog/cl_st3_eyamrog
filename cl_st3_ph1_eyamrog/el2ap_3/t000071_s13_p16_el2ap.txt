Then there is the question of how the results of
this and other verification systems, whether for peer reviews, indexing,
and other elements, will be communicated to readers and authors.
Here we have begun to develop a “Publication Facts” label,
based on the common FDA Nutrition Facts label (Fig. 3).
This approach will be not only be open to public
scrutiny, following open science principles, but also assessed and refined
with various audiences, from high school students to journalists, to
ensure the label’s clarity and comprehensibility with researchers and members
of the public who should be able to use the
label to assess the trustworthiness of research articles.12 The label,
which will be linked to individual studies, will provide metrics
on their compliance with standards, along with detailed explanations of
each standard and metric. Such labelling is intended to inform
and educate the public and the professions on research standards,
while providing a basis for readers to briefly consider or
explore in more detail the trustworthiness of research publications.
