As in Kim, Phipps, and Anselin (2003), Campos (2017) and
Campos, and Almeida (2018), the distribution of extrinsic and intrinsic
house characteristics are not uniformly distributed in a weighting area,
as proposed by Megbolugbe and Hoek-Smit (1996). We seek to
overcome this limitation by considering the spatial location of each
house and amenity (school, shop, library, etc.) instead of the
quantity of or participation amenities in the weighting area. This
approach allows units within the weighting area to configure different
neighborhoods, depending on the areaâ€™s size created by the selected
distance matrix W cut-off. Another advantage is to avoid the
neighborhood discretion imposed by the government in the area composition
(district, census tracts, etc.).
