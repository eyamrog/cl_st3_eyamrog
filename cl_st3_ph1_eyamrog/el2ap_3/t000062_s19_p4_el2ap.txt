The species richness estimators that came closest to the total
of observed species were Bootstrap and Jackknife 1, they indicated
24 â€“ 31 species potentially present (figure 5 a), this
result was obtained when performed as a function of richness
per treatment, where only Bootstrap was within the standard deviation
in the three treatments (FA, IA, and DA), Jackknife 2
and Chao 1 were the least conservative, Jackknife 1 and
Bootstrap were the most conservative. IA has the smallest difference
between estimators (figure 5 c), DA and FA have the
greatest difference between estimators (figure 5 b, d).
