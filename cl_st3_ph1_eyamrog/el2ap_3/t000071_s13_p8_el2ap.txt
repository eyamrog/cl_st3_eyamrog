Nonetheless, our experiment of reaching out to publishers and journals
has had limited success. What we found adds to the
literature on predatory list overreach. However, a response rate of
28.0 percent among publishers and 3.9 percent among standalone journals,
with only two publishers acting on our suggestions, suggests that
while this may be the right thing to do, it
is not an effective strategy for rectifying this issue, which
calls for increasing certainties around identifying fraudulent journals.
