Coevolutionary dynamics, in our model, therefore, may reduce the total
number of interactions, favoring specialization. We then explored if the
removal of interactions by coevolutionary dynamics deviates from random removal
of interactions from the initial network. To do so, for
each simulation, we created a third network generated by removing
F interactions from the initial network. This network, therefore, has
the same number of interactions than the coevolved network but
the set of interactions removed was randomly defined. We then
compared how network structure changes with random loss of interactions
and loss of interactions due to trait dissimilarity of coevolution
outcomes.
