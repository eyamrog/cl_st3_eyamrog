The presence of a double seed coat was also observed,
with a positive reaction to treatment with TBO, where the
external seed coat, called testa, presented a dark green colour
indicating the presence of tannic compounds (figure 1b). The internal
seed coat, called tegmen, showed a greenish colour indicating phenolic
composition and purple coloration in the plumose appendages, indicating rich
in pectin composition (figure 1b).
