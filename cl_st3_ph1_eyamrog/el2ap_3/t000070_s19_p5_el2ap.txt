Anatomical analysis by light microscopy of different days of seed
collection (DAA) and exposure to cryopreservation and non-cryopreservation, did not
reveal mechanical damage, such as rupture of the cell wall
as damage to the membrane system. However, differences were observed
in the response to histochemical reactions of the contents of
chemical compounds in the regions of the seed coat, the
endosperm, the aleurone layer, and the embryo (figure 1).
