Subsequently, descriptive and CIA research based on data from CorIFA
were presented to illustrate the contributions that the corpus has
already provided for researchers interested in learner interlanguage. The studies
pinpointed in this paper serve to reinforce the claim that
compiling and observing a learner corpus can be an invaluable
resource for language teachers keen to enhance their understanding of
learners' output, enabling them to make more accurate pedagogical decisions
for their classes.
