These mosquitoes represent an important link in the transmission chain
of many neglected, emerging and re-emerging diseases [22–24]. The collection
boasts samples of diverse species of great medical importance (Table
1), for example, Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse, 1895) and Aedes
(Stegomyia) aegypti (Linnaeus, 1762), considered to be the main vectors
of Dengue (DENV), Zika Virus (ZIKV), and Chikungunya (CHIKV). Aedes
aegypti is also an important element in the transmission of
Yellow Fever (YFV) in the urban environment [25,26]. The species
Haemagogus (Conopostegus) leucocelaenus (Dyar & Shannon, 1924) and Aedes (Ochlerotatus)
fulvus (Wiedemann, 1828), included in the Aedini tribe, are also
associated with yellow fever, but in forested environments [27,28]. In
recent laboratory research, Lourenço-de-Oliveira and Failoux [29] observed the vectorial
competence of the species Hg. leucocelaenus and Aedes (Protomacleaya) terrens
(Walker, 1856) for the Chikungunya virus, noting that both can
transmit this virus. Furthermore, the genus Culex is an important
group in the transmission of Wuchereria bancrofti (lymphatic filariasis), encephalitis,
and such serious haemorrhagic fevers as Oropouche fever [30–32], while
the genus Anopheles is the one most responsible for the
transmission Plasmodium spp., which cause human malaria [33–36]. In addition
to the importance for public health, culicids participate effectively in
the transmission of diverse pathogens that cause diseases of veterinary
interest, some of which, such as Equine Infectious Anaemia (EIA),
dirofilariasis and West Nile fever [37–41], have zoonotic potential, reaffirming
the importance that culicids have in the epidemiological chain of
diseases transmitted by vectors [21,42,43].
