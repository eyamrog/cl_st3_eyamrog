The corpus carries an array of academic registers from statement
of purpose to research paper. Students write their texts as
course requirements, following the teachers’ instructions in terms of number
of words and topics. The registers have been gradually distributed,
starting with, for example, statement of purposes or summaries in
IFA I and, ending with a research paper or literature
review for IFA V. After students turn in the first
draft text, teachers adjust the teaching of that register to
their students’ needs. Each subject design includes several exercises on
each register and the opportunity for text editing. Students then
submit a second and/or third draft that is edited and
graded. For the corpus compilation, these texts are categorized into
unedited and edited versions.
