Confirmatory factor analysis (structural equation model) showed an excellent fit
Ï‡2= 2.42, Goodness of Fit Index (GFI)= 0.92 (acceptable greater
than or equal to 0.85), Adjusted for Degrees of Freedom
(AGFI)= 0.89 (acceptable greater than or equal to 0.80), Bentler
& Bonett's Non-Normed Fit Index (NNFI)=0. 92 (acceptable values close
to 1), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI)=0.96 (acceptable values close to 1),
Bentler's Comparative Fit Index (CFI)=0.93 (acceptable values greater than or
equal to 0.90), Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA)=0.041
(90% CI 0.034; 0.062) (acceptable values less than or equal
to 0.08). All factor loadings were statistically different from zero
(0; t>1.96, p<0.05). The acceptance values of the above rates
were considered by Hair et al, (2009), Hatcher (1994), Hu
& Bentler (1999) and Bowling (2005). The items of the
five factors were loaded significantly by adopting as significant those
equal or greater than 0.60, which also satisfies the necessary
condition for the content validity of the scale (Nunnally, 1978),
in which the items are evaluated on a single construct.
The results of the assessed indices and content validity, confirmed
by the correlation between the items in factor analysis; Pearson
correlation and corrected item- total correlation confirm the content validity
of the scale. These data demonstrated a good adequacy of
the factor analysis data matrix. The observed communalities ranged from
0.61 to 0.89, the latter being observed in item 8
"Taking selfie in different poses increases my social status", which
accounted for 89% of the variance explained by the factors.
High factor communalities (equal to or above 0.5) indicate that
the principal components method extracted a large amount of variance
from a particular item (Hair et al., 2009). The "environmental
enhancement" factor had the least amount of variance explained (20.33%).
The "subjective conformity", "mood and confidence", "attention seeking" and "social
competition" factors accounted respectively for 78.22%, 67.88%, 52.34% and 38.94%
of the variance explained for each factor (table 1).
