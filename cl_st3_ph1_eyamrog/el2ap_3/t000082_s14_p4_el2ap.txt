We assume if the trait difference between i and j
is higher or equal to 𝜀𝑖𝑗, |Zj(t)-Zi(t)| ≥𝜀𝑖𝑗, then δij=0,
and the cheater species imposes no selection on the victim.
Thus, 𝜀𝑖𝑗 represents a trait barrier preventing the interaction due
to trait dissimilarity (e.g., Santamaria & Rodríguez-Gironés 2007). However, if
|Zj(t)-Zi(t)|< 𝜀𝑖𝑗, then δij=1 and selection on victim i will
favor the increase or decrease of trait values depending on
Zj(t)-Zi(t). If Zj(t)-Zi(t) is positive, the signal of 𝜀𝑖𝑗 will
be positive. Contrarily, if Zj(t)-Zi(t) is negative, the signal of
𝜀𝑖𝑗will negative (Andreazzi et al. 2017). Finally, we assumed that
the environmental component Sei is the combined effects of all
other selective pressures favoring an optimum trait value for each
