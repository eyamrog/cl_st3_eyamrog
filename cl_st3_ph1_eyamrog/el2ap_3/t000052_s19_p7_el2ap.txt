Our dataset contained 68 individuals with 21 quantitative variables (Fig.
3). Among the 68 individuals, three were considered as illustrative
(#66 corresponds to B. auchenoglanii, #67 corresponds to B. fraudulenta
and #68 corresponds to B. anthopenis). The first two dimensions
of the PCA represent 71.73% of the total dataset inertia.
Individuals are clustered into three groups which correspond to the
three species included in the analysis (Bagrobdella vanhovei, B. vansteenbergei
and Bagrobdella pauchenoglanii) (Fig. 12 & 13). The dimension 1
opposes most individuals belonging to the group B. vanhovei (to
the right of the graph, characterized by a positive coordinate
on the axis) to individuals belonging to the groups B.
vansteenbergi and B. parauchenoglanii (from Cameroon), to the left of
the graph, characterized by a strongly negative coordinate on the
axis).
