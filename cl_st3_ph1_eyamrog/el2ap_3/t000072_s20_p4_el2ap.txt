Solanaceae was the third in species diversity. The individuals recognized
in the present study are zoochoric, whose dispersion of their
seeds is carried out by animals after ingestion (Ruschel et
al. 2008). We can cite the example of Solanum lycocarpum
A.St-Hil., in which its main disperser is the guara wolf
(Chrysocyon brachyurus Illiger, 1815) (Massara et al. 2012), an endangered
mammal (Brazil 2014). In a work carried out by Müller
(2016), the presence of the guara wolf was observed in
the areas of the Guarnição da Aeronáutica de Pirassununga, which
may be the disperser of the species in the study
area. About 83% of all species of the Solanaceae family
are dispersed by animals, being important in the structuring of
forest communities (Albuquerque et al. 2006), colonizing open areas such
as clearings, pastures and forest edges, as they are categorized
as pioneers, needing direct sunlight to develop (Tabarelli et al.
1999).
