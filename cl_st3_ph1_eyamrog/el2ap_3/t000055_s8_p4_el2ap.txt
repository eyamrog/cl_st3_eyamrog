The collection was officially started in 1953, as part of
the work of Professor Amilcar Vianna Martins and Alda Lima
Falcão, in collaboration with the technician João Evangelista da Silva,
who participated in all fieldwork [13]. The number of specimens
in the collection increased considerably during the 1960s and 1970s,
and during the last 20 years fossil specimens, as well
as voucher specimens from DNA-based barcoding studies and other epidemiological
studies involving fieldwork, are still being deposited in the collection
[7,14].
