We point out that, in this research, the words “positive”
and “negative” do not mean “good” or “bad”; they are
just used to indicate two opposite poles. In other words,
positive politeness is related to the interlocutor’s desire to belong
to a group, being thought of as a member of
it, whereas negative politeness concerns the interlocutor’s respect, distance, and
deference. In this vein, Scollon and Scollon (1983) call positive
politeness “solidarity politeness” and negative politeness “deference politeness”. Bazergan (2017,
p. 40) postulates that “lying behind solidarity politeness is the
assumption that there is little distance (-D)11 between the participants
and that there is also at most a slight power
(-P) difference between them”. Concerning deference politeness, “participants are considered
to be equals or near equals but treat each other
at a distance” (Scollon & Scollon, 1995, p. 44). Therefore,
deference politeness draws attention to the participants’ distance and solidarity
politeness is more focused on the common grounds of the
participants’ relations.
