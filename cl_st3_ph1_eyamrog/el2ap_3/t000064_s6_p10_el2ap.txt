In the present experiment, the chlorophyll content was not directly
measured, but the comparison carried out showed that the plants
in the greenhouse, partially shaded, had about the double of
chlorophyll (2.99 CCI) as the plantlets in vitro (1.37 CCI)
but a little bit less than half of the open
garden plants (8.70 CCI). However, all the experimental groups showed
much less chlorophyll compared to the wild plants (24.6 CCI).
Certainly, the improvement of PAR intensity from in vitro to
garden condition could explain those differences seen, but it was
not clear why the young plants at the garden showed
a chlorophyll content of about one third of the wild
plants. It is noteworthy that the anatomical structure of the
leaves of the plants grown in the garden was overall
similar to the plants in the fields, except for a
smaller thickness. So, the growth under plentiful sunlight resulted in
anatomically mature leaves, but photosynthetically they showed a pattern of
relative immaturity.
