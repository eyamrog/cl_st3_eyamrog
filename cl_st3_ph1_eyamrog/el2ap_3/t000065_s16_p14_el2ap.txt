In this section, we survey the backdrop of studies that
employ CorIFA in their research. In the past six years,
since the beginning of its compilation, the corpus has been
a rich linguistic database for Brazilian researchers. Hitherto, research has
mainly centered on learners’ language description and on contrasting learners’
written interlanguage with data from other corpora using CIA (as
pointed out in section 2). Relying on two main academic
genres: argumentative essays and abstracts, the studies focus on the
understanding of learners' use of English as they are at
different proficiency levels and also on detecting their underuse or
overuse of specific linguistic features. Most studies use a reference
corpus composed of well-evaluated non-native speakers’ essays or native-speakers’ texts.
The topics encompass linking adverbials, collocations, that- clauses, conjunctions, noun
phrases, and passive constructions. For organizational reasons, first, we bring
an overview of one descriptive study and five investigations that
fall under the CIA perspective. This section ends with a
CorIFA-based study that highlights a pedagogical intervention, leading to reflections
on applications of learner corpus research.
