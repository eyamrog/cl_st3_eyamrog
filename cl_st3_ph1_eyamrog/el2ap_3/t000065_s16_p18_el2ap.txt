The studies with our learner corpus described up to this
point show the extent to which specific corpus analysis can
shed light on the understanding of learners’ linguistic needs, considering
the register they wrote, their proficiency level and type of
tasks. The ultimate general goal of developing such studies is
catering to learners’ exact difficulties because more precisely designed activities
can be prepared and the course syllabus redesigned. A good
example of a combination of interlanguage analysis and classroom activities
was developed by Alves and Pinto (2018). First, the study
investigated how results and conclusions were reported in abstracts in
two apprentice corpora: CorIFA and MICUSP. CorIFA analysis provided real
examples of learner language and the access to MICUSP allowed
students to experience a corpus linguistics pedagogical practice: Do-it-Yourself (DIY)
corpora (McEnery et al., 2006). Students compiled their own study
corpus and were able to raise their awareness on how
to improve the final two rounds of abstracts. MICUSP was
a suitable corpus for DIY since they are formed by
well- evaluated university papers and the online framework allows for
the user to choose discipline- specific texts.
