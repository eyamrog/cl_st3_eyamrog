Identification. The main characteristic is the presence of the orange
pigment that stains the basidioma when it is cut (Cortez
et al. 2008). Another distinctive feature is its long rhizomorphic
extension of 20-200 mm in diameter and 10-100 mm high,
which folds at the base and is attached by one
or more thin rhizomorphs (Wright & Albert√≥ 2006).
