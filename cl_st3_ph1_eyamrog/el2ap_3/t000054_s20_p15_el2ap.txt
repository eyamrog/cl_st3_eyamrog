Peyote is a cactus native to the arid zones of
Mexico and the southern US. Two species are included under
that common name, Lophophora williamsii and Lophophora diffusa. The first
of them produces mescaline and the second produces pellotine, alkaloids
with high psychotropic effects similar to those of lysergic acid.
