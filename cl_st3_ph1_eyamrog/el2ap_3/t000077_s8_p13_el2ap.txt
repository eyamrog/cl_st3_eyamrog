Gaudecker et al. (2020), analyzing data from the Netherlands, have
found that the total hours worked reduced more for the
self-employed, because firms insure employees against transitory shocks, and for
workers with less education, since workers with higher education may
work more hours at home. These authors divided the economic
sectors into two clusters: one dominated by office occupations with
high participation of academics, hours of work at home and
a reduced involvement of “essential” workers; and another in which
manual tasks and social interactions are predominant, with low participation
of academics and hours of work at home and a
greater participation of “essential” workers (Gaudecker et al., 2020).
