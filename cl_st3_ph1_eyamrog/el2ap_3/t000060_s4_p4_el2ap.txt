Both in ordinary conversation and in forensic settings, the particular
circumstances in which questions and answers are developed make facework
a constant need in verbal interactions. Since it is not
possible to predict what interlocutors think or act, speakers employ
mechanisms to ensure the defense of what they do not
want to see exhibited and highlight what they want to
be shown. According to Flower (2018, p. 31), facework strategies
have multiple uses intended to save, maintain, give, and threaten
face.
