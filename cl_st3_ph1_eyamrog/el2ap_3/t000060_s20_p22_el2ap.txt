Using the expression I don’t believe it’s non-responsive, Ms Willmott
tries to explain why Arias had to describe and give
some background information to answer her question. Markers such as
I think, I believe, and I assume, for example, are
classified as opinion markers, commonly used with the first person
singular. Although the epistemic value of opinion verbs usually expresses
certainty and conviction, they sometimes may denote uncertainty or inaccuracy.
In this case, the opinion marker is used as a
facework device since it contributes to limit or neutralize possible
contrary reactions or harmful interpretations from interlocutors. So, we observe
an intention to guide listeners (mainly the Judge) on how
to interpret the speech. It is a modalization marker as
it mitigates the illocutionary force of the utterance. When using
I don’t believe, we can protect our positive face by
preserving our opinion from those who may not have the
same opinion.
