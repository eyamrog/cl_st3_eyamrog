Research ethics has been the object of an intense movement
of regulation of research based on a preconceived model, under
the logic of biomedical sciences. In this context of a
mostly normative answer to the moral question, this article aims
to offer arguments about the potential of forming morality through
research practice. For this, it combines theoretical research, centered on
the concepts of mimesis developed by Adorno and Benjamin, with
the analysis of responses to an online questionnaire offered by
undergraduate students in the humanities and social sciences with experience
in undergraduate scientific research (USR). The formative potential of USR
is affirmed, as it is a privileged instance for the
analysis of mimetic behavior, allowing the learning of beginners through
observation and the practical application of concepts from the moral
field to research.
