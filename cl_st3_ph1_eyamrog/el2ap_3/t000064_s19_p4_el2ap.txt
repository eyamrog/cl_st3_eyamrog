The leaf transpiration rates were kept constant throughout the measurements
for the light response curves but varied among the experimental
groups. The wild plants showed the higher transpiration rates, followed
by the in vitro plants. The plants growing in the
greenhouse and at the garden showed similar transpiration rates, but
inferior to the wild plants. Thus, the instantaneous water use
efficiency was higher in the young, garden growing plants than
adult wild plants (table 1).
