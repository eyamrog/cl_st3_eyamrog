The agenda for the future is promising and shall contemplate
among other issues, advances in research methodologies, granting better access
to students' interlanguage, longitudinal studies and description variation across registers
and discipline. Furthermore, it is of utmost importance that DDL
activities (Johns, 1991) are more present in the language classroom,
providing information on their advantages and limitations, and thus transferring
research data into direct application, as in Almeida et al.
(in press).
