It has been observed that the participants in formal settings
such as courtrooms, classrooms, news interviews, etc., tend to methodically
organize their conduct so as to exhibit and produce the
‘institutional’ quality of their encounter (Drew and Heritage, 1992, p.
26). Furthermore, their conduct is constrained by a diminution of
the array of options and possibilities for action that usually
take place in ordinary conversation. […] In comparing the use
of formulations in institutional settings and ordinary conversation, Paul Drew
notes that formulations are rarely found in ordinary conversation (Drew,
2003). According to Drew, this is so because “we do
not need to arrive at compromises after long negotiations in
mundane conversation” (Drew, 2003, p. 306).
