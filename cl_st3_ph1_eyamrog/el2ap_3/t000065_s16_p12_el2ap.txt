Another characteristic related to the corpus design is its potential
for longitudinal studies, as its data can help researchers better
understand the relationship between students’ writing development and proficiency level.
There is a paucity of learner corpus studies from a
longitudinal perspective (except for Biber et al., 2020; Goutéraux, 2013;
Littré, 2015; Meunier & Littré, 2013). Up to 2019, 217
students submitted texts for more than one semester. Among these,
197 submitted them for a period of one year (two
semesters), and 20 for more than one year (3 semesters
or more). Interestingly, CorIFA data may come from students who
started taking IFA classes as undergraduate students and continued to
register after starting a graduate program.
