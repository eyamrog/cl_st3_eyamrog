This is likely to apply not only to health sciences
journals from Latin America and the Caribbean, but also to
those from other regions. If journals indexed in MEDLINE can
have similar authorship concentration indexes as those indexed in LILACS,
adjusting for journal size, then these indexes can be reasonably
expected to have a similar distribution in other reputable bibliographic
databases, at least in the health sciences. Perhaps even the
relative abundance of non English-language journals in the outliers of
Scanff and colleagues (2021) can also be explained by larger
journals publishing in English, although verifying this is not in
the scope of the present study. It remains an open
question whether the distribution of authorship concentration indexes is the
same in disciplines other than the health sciences.
