Itaim Bibi and Pinheiros are districts with the highest concentration
of workers receiving more than 5 minimum wage monthly, as
shown in the Table 8. On the other hand, Bel√©m
and Campo Belo are the subcenters with the largest share
of workers receiving less than 2 minimum wages monthly (60%
and 54%, respectively). While the first two SBD demand highly
skilled people for jobs supplied, the last two are concentrated
in manufacturing and civil construction activities, which demand workers with
less schooling.
