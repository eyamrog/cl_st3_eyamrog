From the recommendations of Braga et al. (2016), each sample
was removed the ground to a depth of 10 cm,
in two steps. The first was the removal of the
soil of 0-5 cm, being called upper, and in the
second, withdrew in the depth of 5-10 cm, called below.
Samples of the two depths were packed in different plastic
bags. After collecting the samples were arranged in plastic trays,
first pouring the lower, covering it with the upper and
subsequently, taken to germination in the shading of 60% and
two three-minute daily irrigations through microspersors.
