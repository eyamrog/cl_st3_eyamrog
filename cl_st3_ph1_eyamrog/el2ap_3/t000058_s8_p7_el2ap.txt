Insects of the family Culicidae (order Diptera), commonly known as
mosquitoes, have a wide geographic distribution. There are currently 3,591
described species, divided into two subfamilies (Anophelinae and Culicinae), distributed
in 113 genera [12] with around 31% found in the
Neotropical region [13,14]. There are 530 recorded species in Brazil,
belonging to 23 genera distributed throughout all biomes and six
of these are endemic to the country [16]. There are
currently 191 culicidae species in the state of Paraná [17–19],
though these numbers show a tendency to increase with the
intensification of research due to the epidemiological importance of this
group. [20,21].
