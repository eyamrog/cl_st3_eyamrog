To address topics 1 and 2 (view, change on perception
and interest on science, scientists and health professionals), we applied
an anonymous quantitative multiple-choice on-line survey in Spanish to a
voluntary national corpus of 14 to 19 year olds with
Internet access in Mexico, between May 5 and June 27,
2021.
