Several learner corpus studies use Contrastive Interlanguage Analysis (CIA), which
can be understood as analysis that “involves the comparison between
learner language and the target language” (Granger, 2015, p. 13).
Learner language has been called ‘Interlanguage Varieties’ (ILV), especially highlighting
“the highly variable nature of interlanguage” (Granger, 2015, p. 18).
This approach may compare students’ oral or written texts with
native speakers’ texts (ILV vs. NS) (De Cock et al.,
1998, on word combinations in a English learner corpus of
French as a first language vs. an English native speaker
corpus), interlanguage variety with learners’ first language and with native
speakers’ (ILV vs. L1 vs. NS) (Altenberg & Taper, 1998)
on adverbial connectors in Sw-ICLE14, in a Swedish as L1
corpus and in LOCNESS) or two interlanguage varieties or more
(ILV vs ILV) (Bohórquez, 2015, on lexical bundles on Ch-ICLE
and Dt- ICLE).15
