The ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) identifier was used
to disambiguate authors whenever possible; it was available for 7.2%
of the “authorships” (authors per article times number of articles).
After minimal processing of author names (such as removing extraneous
elements), the ORCID id was used instead of author names
when such names occurred with one and only one ORCID
id. The procedure was repeated after author names had their
diacritics removed (names were encoded in ASCII) and hyphens replaced
with white space (because Spanish-language authors sometimes introduce them to
ensure indexing by first family name). In the end, there
were 148 (0.5%) unique author names associated with more than
one ORCID id while also sometimes occurring with no ORCID
id. Because it was not clear which ORCID id to
impute, these authors (and those with no ORCID id author)
were identified by the author name, as in Scanff and
colleagues (2021).
