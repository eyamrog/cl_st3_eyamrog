By now, our results suggest that the incorporation of the
selection imposed by the cheating interactions that naturally emerge from
mutualisms is pivotal to a deep understanding of the coevolutionary
dynamics in species- rich mutualisms. Cheating interactions change the outcomes
of mutualistic coevolution, leading to increased interspecific trait variation and
clustering. We provide insights on the effect of multiple interaction
types in a network and how it may shape trait
diversity by the contrasting selective forces favoring convergence and disparity
across interacting species (Sauve et al. 2016). The structure of
simulated networks significantly changed when we increased the frequency of
cheating interactions, and this result opens new questions on which
is the balance of positive and negative effects that maintains
the structure of empirical networks. Our theoretical predictions may also
help us to understand how networks might evolve under a
rapidly changing world, in which interactions are vanishing due to
several anthropogenic impacts, with unknown consequences for ecosystem functioning.
