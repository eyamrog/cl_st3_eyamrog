Comparing with the study conducted by Neto et al. (2020),
the dominant species proved to be quite similar, since in
the seed bank of a mature semideciduous forest studied by
these authors, the species that most emerged were T. micrantha
(L.) Blume, Cecropia hololeuca Miq. and Solanum sp. such species
are known to remain for a long time in the
soil, requiring luminous areas for germination (Martins 2016). These species
are essential for the regeneration of forests, as they are
of primary nature and germinate in clearings and edges of
the fragments (Pereira et al. 2010; Correia & Martins 2015),
being dispersed by animals, mainly birds (Ruschel et al. 2008).
