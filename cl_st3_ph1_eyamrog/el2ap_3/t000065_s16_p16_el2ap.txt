Three of the CIA studies carried out based on CorIFA
are on learners’ use of conjunctions, which have been considered
key features in text coherence (Halliday & Hasan, 1976; Chen,
2006; Liu, 2008; Zihan, 2014). Yet, these linguistic features “are
not always needed and (...) they have to be used
with discrimination” (Altenberg & Tapper, 1998, p. 80), posing difficulties
to learners as they “tend[s] to vary from one language
and culture to another” (Altenberg & Tapper, 1998, p. 81).
Dutra et al. (2017 and 2019) and Santos (2008) used
a CorIFA subcorpus of B1 level argumentative essays, contrasting it
to LOCNESS. Despite the fact that these investigations dealt with
different conjunctions; Dutra et al. (2017) studied addition words (besides
and also), Dutra et al. (2019) result markers (thus, so
and therefore) and Santos (2018) contrasting connectors (but and however),
they all detected either substantial quantitative differences (underuse or overuse
as compared to LOCNESS or MICUSP), sentence position disparities, as
well as discourse function inadequacies on the part of the
learners. For instance, the marker so is used three times
more in CorIFA than in LOCNESS, assuming beginning sentence functions
of initiating a topic or announcing that an idea is
going to be presented again (DUTRA et al., 2019), which
have been attested as oral discourse markers (Carter & McCarthy,
2006). An interpretation shared by the three CorIFA investigations based
on learners’ overuse of conjunctions in sentence initial position is
that register awareness needs to be better addressed in the
Brazilian university context.
