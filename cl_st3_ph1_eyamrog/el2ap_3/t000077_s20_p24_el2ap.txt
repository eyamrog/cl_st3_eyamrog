As pointed out by Gottlieb et al. (2021), the result
that more educated and salaried employees (other than self-employed or
employers) are more likely to work from home, even when
specific types of work are controlled, means that the propensity
to remote work varies between occupations, but that there is
also important heterogeneity within these occupations.
