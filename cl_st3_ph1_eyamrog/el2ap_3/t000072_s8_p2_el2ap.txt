The fragmentation of forest formations, which are isolated stains of
forests enveloped by areas that have suffered anthropic transformation, can
generate negative edge effect and also the isolation of species
(Cosgrove et al. 2018). Fragmentation can also cause change in
the pattern of seed dispersal of a certain area (Cordeiro
& Howe 2003), altering the maintenance of genetic diversity and
gene flow (Wang & Smith 2002). Forest formations such as
riparian forests along the course of water are important for
maintenance of the gene flow, since they interconnect populations affected
by fragmentation (Kageyama & Gandara 2001). In addition, they contribute
to the stabilization of margins of watercourse, acting as natural
filterers of nutrients and agrochemicals, intercepting and absorbing solar radiation
and providing shelter and food for aquatic and terrestrial fauna
(Sabino & Castro 1990).
