Researchers compiling their own corpus need to adopt strict design
criteria. According to Gilquin (2015, p. 16), in the case
of learner corpora creation, the rules adopted are “even more
crucial, given the highly heterogeneous nature of interlanguage” and such
design criteria will be fully addressed in the next section.
Moreover, few studies investigated students’ texts produced in their own
class writing contexts (Staples & Reppen, 2016), a gap that
CorIFA studies serves to fill as the corpus is compiled
from class activities in “English for Academic Purposes.” With detailed
gathering of learner metadata, and careful consideration of task and
language variables, as described in the next section, CorIFA allows
for thorough studies on classroom contextualized learner writing.
