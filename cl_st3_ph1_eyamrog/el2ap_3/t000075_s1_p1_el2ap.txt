The mainstream studies on capital accounts underwent important changes over
the last three decades. Starting from the theoretical models that
grounded full capital account liberalization, the financial crises that hit
emerging markets in the 1990s and then the global financial
crisis that broke out in 2008 showed several dysfunctions of
financial globalization. In addition, the post-global crisis period provided new
evidence on the effectiveness of regulation measures. In response to
much evidence contradicting the earlier ex ante models, several mainstream
authors developed new models that ground the use of capital
controls. In this context, the main objective of this paper
is to analyze the recent evolution of mainstream economics on
capital account liberalization and capital controls, focusing on its new
evidence and theoretical reorientation. This paper sustains that the new
mainstream models represent a new phase in its approach on
the regulation of international capital flows.
