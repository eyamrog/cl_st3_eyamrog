Liberali (2020) points out that constructing social change is mandatory
for an effective transformation of the unfair contradictions that seem
to be expanding in our reality. What participants experienced in
the workshop described here is meant to help them engage
in more politically and ethically driven activities. The inevitability of
such engagement demands taking a critical stance towards values and
whatever it is one aspires to do. The process of
self-development takes place as the world changes and both events
affect one another. As such, there is an urgent need
for the building of agency for social transformation beyond the
everyday reality that tends to keep people apart.
