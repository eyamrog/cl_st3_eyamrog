Spider families can be divided into five behavioral guilds according
to Diniz (2011). The collections of this study indicated that
the most frequent families belong to the Builders of Three
â€“dimensional Web (TDW) represented by Linyphiidae and Theridiidae and to
the Night Corridors (NC) represented by Corinnidae and Xenoctenidae. The
spiders of the TDW guild have a greater interest in
denser leaf architecture and preference for plants with larger spaces
between the leaves (Diniz, 2011), the statistical data found for
Linyphiidae corroborate the preference for open areas. The data obtained
for Theridiidae need further studies to understand its dynamics. While
NC guild spiders prefer environments with complex structure, probably due
to the protection against predators and parasites offered by the
plant architecture (Diniz 2011) and the higher occurrence of NC
guild spiders found in AD, corroborates the literature.
