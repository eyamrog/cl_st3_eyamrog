It is widely recognized that several authors from the Keynesian/Structuralist
tradition in economics have been calling attention for the inherent
instability of capital flows since the seminal works of Keynes
on this subject1. Among them, one particular strand focuses on
the ability that few currencies have to denominate debt contracts
and derivative instruments in international markets. This ‘currency hierarchy’, therefore,
implies that a considerable share of capital flows to economies
whose currencies are inconvertible may be determined according to the
international investors’ state of liquidity preference (Prates, 2005; Prates; Cintra,
2008; Conti et al., 2014; Fritz; Prates, 2014). As consequence,
the interest rate performed by these peripheral economies2 may be
subjected to pressures coming from their respective exchange rates (Ocampo,
2016), which implies loss of monetary policy independence and consequently
the fail of the ‘impossible trinity’ condition. It is also
noteworthy that such negative side effects can be stronger in
those peripheral economies whose current accounts are structurally deficient (Oliveira,
2011; 2012). Therefore, according to this Keynesian/Structuralist perspective, the use
of capital controls and macroprudential policies should be thought as
instruments available to peripheral economies to deal permanently with such
inherent asymmetries of the contemporaneous International Monetary and Financial System
(IMFS). In other words, such measures could then partially offset
the negative side effects derived from these currencies inconvertibility.3
