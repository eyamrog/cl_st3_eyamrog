Unlike Plato, Aristotle (2000) rehabilitates the concept and its applicability
to the educational field, as he sees mimesis as endowed
with positive stimuli to be worked on by education. He
focused his analysis on the potential of mimetic behavior to
generate learning, which is even more important than the object
of imitation itself. Although both Greek philosophers recognize that mimesis
is part of human nature, especially in children, Aristotle (2000)
understands that this behavior does not deviate the subject from
knowledge, on the contrary, it works as a resource that
“stimulates and encourages the knowledge process (importance of playfulness)” (Gagnebin,
1993: 71). Aristotle (apud Carvalho, 2019: 20), thus shifts the
analysis of mimesis (which, in Plato, was centered on the
imperfection inherent in representation), highlighting two positive aspects: the creative
potential mobilized in the subject so that he is able
to establish a relationship of imitation and the fact that
imitation is a pleasurable activity for human beings in general.
