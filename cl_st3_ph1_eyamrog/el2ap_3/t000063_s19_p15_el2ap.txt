Analyzing the official ANUIES reportsâ€™ databases we found that overall
applications rose by 6.5% from 2019-2020 to 2020-2021 school years
(from 2,053,348 to 2,186,739). During this period, there was a
21.5% increase in applications for natural sciences, math and statistics
(from 67,649 to 82,214) and a 17.1% increase during the
same period for health sciences (from 374,231 to 438,284). In
the first year of the pandemic the increase in first
year applications for scientific (science and health care) fields were
well above (21.5% and 17.1%) than the increase in other
fields of study (6.5%). (Fig. 5.a)
