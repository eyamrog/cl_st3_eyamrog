The mean values of the Pielou index were between 0.78
for region R, and 0.87 for region I. Therefore, in
region I the species are better distributed, with no ecological
dominance, but it can be observed that the values index
for both areas are high, resulting in a good distribution
of species. When the value for the Pielou index is
low, it is possible to assume that the total number
of individuals belongs to a few species (Pin√£-Rodrigues & Aoki
2014). In a study carried out on the edge of
semideciduous forest, the Pielou index found was 0.79, considering the
values of the present study (Bargoena et al. 2020).
