Similar results were found by Yasenov (2020), for the United
States, and by Gallacher and Hossain (2020), which analyzed Canada.
And an analogous result is also true when comparing between
countries. Brussevich et al. (2020), for the OECD countries, and
Gottlieb et al. (2021), for a wide group of developing
countries, all found that there is a strong association between
the level of economic development, or the per capita income,
and the ability to work remotely.
