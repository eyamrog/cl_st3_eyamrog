In this context, it is emphasized the relevance of observing
the water content present in the plant material used in
the cryopreservation protocols. This content can be decisive when defining
strategies to avoid possible damage caused by the crystallization of
intracellular water (Vendrame et al. 2014). Factor, particularly, not observed
in the current work and, according to ultrastructural analyses, characterized
by the absence of lysis or damage to membranes and
cell walls. According to González- Arnao & Engelmann (2013), some
low water content in the plant material results in the
change of the water phase during the immersion in LN,
called the “vitrification” phase. This phase allows the elimination of
ice structures by inhibiting the union of water molecules, maintaining
the physical properties of an amorphous solid (Kulus & Zalewska
2014).
