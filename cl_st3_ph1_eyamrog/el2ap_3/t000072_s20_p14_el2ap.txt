Plots I presented an average in the number of species
per plot slightly higher than the plots R, with values
of 12.6 and 11.6 respectively. The diversity indices (H ')
were higher in plots I, ranging from 1.98 to 2.53,
while in plots R, they ranged between 1.74 and 2.02.
Equability indices (J) were also higher in plots I, ranging
from 0.82 to 0.95, while in plots R they ranged
from 0.70 to 0.90 (table 2).
