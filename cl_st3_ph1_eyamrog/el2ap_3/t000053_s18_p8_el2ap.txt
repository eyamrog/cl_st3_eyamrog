We have assembled the most exhaustive scientific data from sand
flies in Acre, Brazil that have been published until now.
This Dataset will provide an important source of knowledge on
the distribution, identification, and taxonomic status of the sand fly
species already recorded in the state. Therefore, it will allow
future studies to have a sound material as a background
for sand fly ecology, epidemiology and taxonomy studies in the
area.
