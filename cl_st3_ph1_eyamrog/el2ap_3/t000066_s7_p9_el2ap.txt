As a core principle in the GPB, play aims at
social change in a broad spectrum. Participants share their everyday
life experiences while playing and expand them to a global
perspective as well, through creativity and connection created in the
workshops (Vygotsky, 2004). They are about hope, emotional support, and
development as participants play and talk to find possibilities beyond
the crisis. This approach in the GPB community seeks to
offer opportunities to question, imagine, and create new realities as
a response to dehumanization and the deterioration of ecosystems.
