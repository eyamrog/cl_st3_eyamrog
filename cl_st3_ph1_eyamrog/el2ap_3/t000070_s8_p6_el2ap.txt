In Bromeliaceae, the use of seeds of some species has
shown a high tolerance for drying and freezing with the
genera Encholirium Mart. ex Schult. & Schult. f. and Dyckia
Schult. & Schult. f. (Tarr√© et al. 2007), in Pitcairnia
albiflos Herbert (Pereira et al. 2010) and ten endemics and
threatened Brazilian species (Rodrigues et al. 2014). This tolerance is
related to the content and deposition of reserves, such as
carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, which are constituents of cells and
membranes, providing protection during the seed maturation and dehydration phase
(Mollo et al. 2011, Carvalho et al. 2019).
