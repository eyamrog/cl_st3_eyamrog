We also must consider that turns can be allocated. Unlike
prototypical sequences “Question 1- Answer 1-Question 2-Answer 2” (Q1-A1-Q2-A2), not
all first pairs necessarily receive immediately their second pairs. These
cases occur when a question-answer sequence is delayed while another
question-answer sequence intervenes. According to Yule (1996, p. 77), “the
sequence will then take the form of Q1-Q2-A2-A1, with the
middle pair (Q2-A2) being called an insertion sequence”. In this
structure, the pair Q2A2 is inserted into the pair Q1A1,
so the embedded pair in the sequence is an insertion
sequence. The author affirms that “although that appears to be
a question (Q2) in response to a question (Q1), the
assumption is that once the second part (A2) of the
insertion sequence is provided, the second part (A1) of the
initial question (Q1) will follow”. As Coulthard and Brazil (1992,
p. 52) observe:
