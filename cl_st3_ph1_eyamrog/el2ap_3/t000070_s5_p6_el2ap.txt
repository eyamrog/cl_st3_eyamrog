Furthermore, there are reports of different species works that show
gains in the germinative percentage of seeds after cryopreservation, of
which, the cooling process at ultra-low temperatures can act to
break seed dormancy. As an example, Rocha et al. (2009)
found in their studies that the cryopreservation process of Gossypium
hirsutum L. seeds promoted an increase in the percentage of
seed germination and seedling vigor, after going through the cryopreservation
process. Cryopreservation also advanced a higher germination percentage of E.
subsecundum (Baker) Mez seeds with a moisture content of 12.7%
(Tarr√© et al. 2007).
