Convergent validity tests whether the items in a scale, or
the dimension of a multidimensional scale, converge to a single
construct or dimension (Graver and Mentzer, 1999). In modelling by
partial least squares (PLS), the convergent validity is shown by
the average variance extracted (AVE), which computes the variance captured
for each variable. The present study showed AVE values above
0.79 (environmental enhancement=0.81; social competition=0.79; attention seeking=0.83; mood and confidence=
0.85 and subjective conformity=0.79) which confirmed the convergent validity of
the scale (Fornell e Larcker 1981; Sanches-Franco & Roldan, 2005;
Balakrishnan e Griffiths, 2017) (table 1).
