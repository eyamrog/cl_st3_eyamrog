This paper discusses core principles such as play, collaboration, and
agency that support the online workshops offered by the Global
Play Brigade (GPB), an international community of activists from different
areas, who got together to fight against the global crisis
that threatened the world in so many ways due to
the covid-19 pandemic. To exemplify part of the theoretical and
methodological approach involved in the plan and, the workshop, as
well as its goals and one of the sessions, will
be described along with perspectives aligned to Spinoza, Vygotsky, Freire,
and some other authors to promote understanding of how people
can be affected towards social change. It is known that
there are many facets to the current turmoil, so the
GPB seeks to create spaces in which creativity and critical
thinking can create possibilities for emotional support, development, hope, and
action.
