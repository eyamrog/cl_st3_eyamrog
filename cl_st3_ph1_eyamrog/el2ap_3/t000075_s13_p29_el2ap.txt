Within this debate about the multilateral aspects of capital controls
and prudential policies, and the necessity for international coordination on
the subject, Ghosh et al.â€™s (2014) study also stands out.
They investigate if capital controls and other regulatory measures (such
as macroprudential policies) were efficient if countries implemented them simultaneously
on capital inflows and capital outflows, from emerging recipient and
advanced source countries. To identify the effectiveness of capital controls
and other regulatory instruments in reducing the volume of cross-border
banking flows, the authors collect a sample of 76 capital
recipient and 31 capital source countries, and perform isolated regressions
for both the recipient and source countries. On the regulatory
measures on capital outflows from source countries, the results show
that prudential regulation on the financial system, especially on external
loans, have a strong impact in reducing bank flows over
the sample period. The regulatory measures imposed on capital inflows
by recipient countries also show some effectiveness in reducing cross-border
banking flows.
