The major centripetal discourses are the watershed and Putin’s war
discourses, which are centred through their sheer frequency of occurrence
and through the recourses of engagement used around them. The
watershed discourse constructs a new reality that demands a total
paradigm shift caused by the invasion of Ukraine, at the
time of speaking three days after its beginning. This invasion
is constructed as an act of aggression not seen in
Europe since World War 2 and at the hands of
an isolated and ruthless oppressor that wants to wipe Ukraine
off the map and build a Russian empire, a view
that I have summarily labelled the Putin’s war discourse.
