Corpus compilation is a challenging research endeavor that many researchers
decide to pursue. Few learner corpora, however, can be easily
accessed (e.g.,the International Corpus of Learner English), and none of
them carry a variety of text registers written by English
learners at different proficiency levels studying in the Brazilian university
context. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to present
the compilation of a learner corpus, much needed in our
research and teaching context, pointing out the advantages of building
this type of corpus for the understanding of learnersâ€™ needs
as well as for pedagogical decision-making based on sound data.
Presenting a detailed rationale of the corpus compilation, this article
reveals the various decisions made in order to guarantee that
fair comparisons can be made. To exemplify the value of
building a carefully designed corpus, results of previous studies are
compared. Some of the conclusions reached refer to the need
for discipline-specific tasks to propel writing proficiency and for authorship
skills to be developed in English for Academic Purposes classes
to foster academic success.
