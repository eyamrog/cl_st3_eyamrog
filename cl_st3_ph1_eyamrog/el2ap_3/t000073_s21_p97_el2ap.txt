Identification. This species is characterized by large basidiomata (up to
8 cm in diameter), involute lacinias, non-hygroscopic, prominent conspicuous collar
around the endoperidium from the pseudoparenchymal layer of exoperidium, sessile
endoperidium, delimited or unbounded fibrous peristoma. (Campi et al. 2018).
Recent phylogenetic studies suggest that the morphological concept of the
species actually represents an assemblage of closely related species which
vary in the distribution patterns (Kasuya et al. 2012).
