This movement to new prescriptions on a stronger regulation of
cross border capital flows also rested on one of the
most important economic forums, the Committee on International Economic Policy
and Reform (CIEPR). Following a similar direction, CIEPR and Eichengreen
(2011) point out the role that macroprudential regulation must assume
to counter asset inflation and credit booms, besides recognizing that
small and liberalized countries lack autonomy in implementing domestic policies.
Hence, these economies should use macroprudential measures and temporary capital
controls, especially on the capital inflows that fund domestic financial
institutions, since the external equilibrium of an emerging economy is
not guaranteed by the hypothesis of real adjustments in the
exchange rate.
