Figure 2 is straightforward, with a clearly monotone pattern. The
share of workers that worked from home increases more rapidly
mainly from the 60th percentile and even more rapidly from
the 80th. Therefore, the consequences of the pandemic reinforced the
pre- existing inequality in the Brazilian labor market, as workers
with higher wages were more likely to have the option
of working from home.
