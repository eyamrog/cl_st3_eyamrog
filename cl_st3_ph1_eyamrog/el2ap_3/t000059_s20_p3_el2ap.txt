The journals’ most prolific author had a median of 8
articles, or 4.5% of the signed articles, with a 95th
percentile of 12.9% (Table 1). One quarter of the journals
had more than one author tied as the most prolific
one. The largest percentage (61.7%, more than twice the next
largest percentage) was observed in a journal (Universitas Scientiarum, with
81 signed articles) which identifies the editor in the articles’
first page; often its articles in SciELO (and records in
LILACS) make it seem like the editor is one of
the authors. (This journal was not included in panels A
and C of Figure 1 for better visualization.) As in
Scanff and colleagues (2021), the proportion of articles by the
most prolific author was lower and less varying in journals
with more articles (panel A in Figure 1).
