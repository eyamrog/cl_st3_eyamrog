A new theoretical literature is emerging in the mainstream that
supports the pertinence of capital controls. This new literature responds
to the flaws of orthodox models that support full capital
account liberalization, as well the empirical evidence of the effectiveness,
under several parameters, of capital controls and macroprudential policies imposed
by several countries. This article thus argues that these new
orthodox models are ex-post constructions, since they benefit from empirical
studies on the effectiveness of capital controls. It is therefore
an important reorientation in the mainstream, given the important influence
of theoretical modeling on future economic policies.
