Identification. The species is characterized by a whitish pseudostipe with
small perforations, an off white, perforate, narrow campanulate, wrinkled to
minutely rugulose receptacle with a toothed margin. The pore at
the receptacle apex is so prominent that a ring-like structure
can be observed around it (Trierveiler-Pereira et al. 2019).
