Most species of Asteraceae have anemocory and herbaceous habit (Silva
et al. 2019), in addition to having many adaptive abilities,
allowing them to occur in different ecosystems (Beretta et al.
2008). The data obtained here coincide with some studies whose
species richness indicates that Asteraceae is expressive in areas of
semideciduous forest (NÃ³brega et al. 2009, Franco et al. 2012,
Silva et al. 2019). It is important to note that
Asteraceae is one of the largest families of angiosperms in
number of species, with anemochoric dispersion and represented in practically
all plant formations in the globe (Lorenzi 2014), which partially
justifies its wide occurrence in the study area.
