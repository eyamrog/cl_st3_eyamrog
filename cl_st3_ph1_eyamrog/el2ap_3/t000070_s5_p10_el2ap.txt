Cryopreservation is the only technique that guarantees the conservation of
genetic material, theoretically for an indefinite period, safely and economically.
(Engelmann 2011). In liquid nitrogen storage (-196 Â°C), all metabolic
activity and cell divisions are interrupted, preventing the degradation of
the stored material and contamination (Cruz -Cruz et al. 2013).
Direct immersion in liquid nitrogen has the advantage of not
requiring the use of cryoprotectants in materials with tolerance to
cooling and low moisture content, as seen in the present
study, and with several examples, such as the one seen
for Dyckia brevifolia Beker and Dyckia delicata Larocca & Sobral
seeds (De Paula et al. 2020), mature seeds of Cattleya
guttata Lindl (Vettorazzi et al. 2019) and for Passiflora edulis
Sims seeds (Generoso et al. 2019). Although the present study
hasn't observed a difference between the storage treatments, it is
assumed that cryopreservation has more long-term advantages when compared to
storage in a refrigerator, in which there may be degradation
and contamination of the material in the medium term.
