Identification. The main characteristic of this species is a globose,
compact basidiome when young, which develop a basal portion like
an inverted pear or a loaf of bread at maturity.
The surface can be commonly brown and broken up into
mosaic-like scales. The gleba is purplish and pulverulent at maturity
(Zeller & Smith 1964, Morales & Kimbrough 1978).
