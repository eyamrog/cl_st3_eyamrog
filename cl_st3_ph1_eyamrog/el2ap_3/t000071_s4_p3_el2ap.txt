If we can provide a publicly accessible, trustworthy basis for
having greater confidence in a journalâ€™s legitimacy, then services such
as Cabells might be willing to shift their efforts from
assembling lists of potential offenders to more directly protecting the
public interest by working with those journals in need of
corrections and other improvements, while still seeking to expose deliberate
acts of deception and fraudulence. What Jeffrey Beall and Cabells
International have exposed, above all, is the need for means
of verifying and communicating journal adherence to scholarly standards in
an age of open access and global participation in research.
