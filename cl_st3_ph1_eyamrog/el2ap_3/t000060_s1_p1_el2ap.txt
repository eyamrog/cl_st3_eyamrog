This article aims to analyse how formulations, politeness, and facework
are employed by speakers to achieve specific purposes in courtroom
interaction. The theoretical framework is based on the concepts of
conversation analysis and forensic linguistics, and the corpus consists of
the trial of Jodi Ann Arias, which received widespread media
attention in the United States. The excerpts under analysis were
taken from the final day of the prosecutor’s cross-examination and
from a reporter’s transcript of proceedings, both available on the
Internet. It is important to highlight that these devices contribute
to construct, enhance, threaten, or weaken people’s image involved in
this kind of context.
