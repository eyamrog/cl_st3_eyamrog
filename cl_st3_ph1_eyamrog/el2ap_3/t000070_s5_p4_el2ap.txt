Cryopreservation has advantages considering the possible storage time, as well
as cryopreservation by direct immersion, which is the cheapest in
the category by not using cryoprotectants or too many reagents.
Concerning the storage of plant material for indefinite periods, cryopreservation
in liquid nitrogen (-196 Â°C) is the only current method
(Engelmann 2011). Likewise, cryopreservation has vast advantages when compared to
traditional conservation methods (Vendrame et al. 2014).
