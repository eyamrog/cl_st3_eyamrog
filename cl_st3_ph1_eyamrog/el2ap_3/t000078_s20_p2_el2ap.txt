Due to the ad hoc characteristic of the neighborhood composition,
different weighting matrices are considered. In this specific evaluation, binary
contiguity (queen and rook), distance, and 𝑘 nearest neighbor weight
matrices are used. In contiguity matrices, 𝑤𝑖𝑗 is equal to
1 if 𝑖 and 𝑗 are contiguous, and zero otherwise.
The used distance weight matrix considers the centroid distances of
the tracts, considering the Euclidean distance. Mathematically, 𝑤𝑖𝑗≤𝑑𝑖𝑗. In this
specification, the maximum distance for at least one neighbor is
8 Km, avoiding the island issue in the econometric estimation.
Concerning the 𝑘 neighbor weight matrix, we chose six closest
neighbors because it is the average number of neighbors in
the database.
