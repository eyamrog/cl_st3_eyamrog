Identification. This species is characterized by having a small receptacle
(5 cm or less, some larger up to 15 cm),
globose to subglobose of reddish coloration, with somewhat regular meshes
(usually round at the apex and more elongated towards the
base) and with a corrugated and folded membrane surrounding the
meshes where the gleba is located (Dring 1980).
