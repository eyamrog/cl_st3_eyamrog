The statistical results indicate that the treatments are similar in
relation to the diversity of spiders. However, it was observed
that the two most abundant families were collected mostly from
different areas. Significant changes in temperature and humidity do not
influence the distribution of the spider assembly (Maciel 2011). But
leaf architecture can influence different guilds in different ways, even
if it does not influence their prey (Diniz 2011).
