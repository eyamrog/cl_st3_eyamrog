One of the biggest controversies about capital controls is if
the instruments should be permanent or sporadic. The experience of
emerging economies in the post-crisis period seems to point to
the second option. In order to counter the trade-offs between
these two types of capital account regulation, several econometric studies
aimed to identify, under several parameters, whether one type of
regulation is superior to another. Another caveat is noteworthy. Permanent
capital controls do not mean that a country is totally
closed to cross-border capital flows; it means that a country
imposes a control on a certain class of asset or
debt and maintains this regulatory measure over time. This classificcation
is independent of the level of taxation, or administrative measure,
of the capital control imposed. In turn, a sporadic capital
control refers to a regulation that the government changes or
lifts quickly, and whose effects can even be stronger relatively
to the permanent capital controls.
