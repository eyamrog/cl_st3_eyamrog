In the school phase (as it happened in the beginnings
of humanity), mimetic behavior is fundamentally determined by physical stimuli,
by physiological reactions to preserve life, in which fear takes
a leading role and the tendency is to imitate the
behavior of the fittest or dissolution in the environment. Adorno
(1993) establishes a relationship between archaic mimicry and the permanence
of this behavior in childhood, as a pre-conceptual phase of
approximation/appropriation of the world. Gebauer and Wulf (2004) assert that,
in Adorno, mimesis figures as a central category of the
educational process (Bildung), constituting intersubjective in social practices, being indispensable
for the creation and conservation of a moral action based
on imitation.
