Leaf anatomy - The leaf anatomy was carried out by
transversal sections of the middle third of three well developed
leaves in each of the groups. The fresh sections were
fixed in FAA70 under vacuum, dehydrated in ethanolic series, included
in resin LeicaÂ® and stained with toluidine blue or safranine
plus Astra blue, according Johansen (1940) and Kraus & Arduin
(1997). The slides were mounted with colourless glass varnish according
to Paiva et al. (2006).
