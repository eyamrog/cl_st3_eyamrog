For the seeds conservation, a 2x3 factorial experimental design was
used: Two conservation methods: 1) Cryopreservation (+LN; at -196 째C)
and; 2) control, non-cryopreserved (-LN) stored in a refrigerator at
4 째C, combined with three collection times (120; 135 and
150 DAA). Each experimental unit consisted of a cryotube containing
30 seeds and four replicates arranged in random blocks. After
24 h of storage (-196 째C and Control), was performed
the immersion in a water bath for two minutes at
42 째C. Afterward, the seeds were disinfected according to the
method described by Guerra & Dal Vesco (2010).
