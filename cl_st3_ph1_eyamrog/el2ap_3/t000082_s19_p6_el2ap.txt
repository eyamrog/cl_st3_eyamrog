In our simulations, coevolutionary dynamics assuming p = 0 (no
cheating interactions) led to almost no change in network structure
[ΔQ ≅ 0; ΔNODF ≅ 0]. As we increase the
frequency of cheating interactions, mutualistic networks become more modular and
less nested (Table 4). This increasing modularity and reduced nestedness
observed was not reproduced by simply randomly removing interactions. Moreover,
the increase in modularity and reduction in nestedness was not
equally distributed across mutualisms. In mutualisms that the empirical network
was initially very modular and not nested (e.g., ant-myrmecophyte networks)
changes in network structure were weaker than in mutualisms showing
higher nestedness (e.g., pollination and seed dispersal). Hence, empirical networks
under the effect of cheaters shift its network structure towards
high modular and low nested patterns (Table 4).
