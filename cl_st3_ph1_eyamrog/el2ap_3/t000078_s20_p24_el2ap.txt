We initially considered different spatial weight matrices for the model
without SBD controls and the functional forms level-level and log-level.
Then, we tested distance weight matrices increasing the initial threshold
by 5% and 10% (8.4 Km and 8.8 Km). This
procedure allows us to test the omission of a relevant
variable when estimating models disregarding SBD.
