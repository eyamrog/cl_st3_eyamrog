It is noteworthy that the depth of the crypts reflected
the growth condition. The stomatal crypts in the leaves are
deeper in the control (field) and garden than greenhouse plants,
and they were totally absent in plants grown in vitro.
They are already present in the young leaves of field
plants (figure 6 d). It is surprising that the presence
of leaf crypts is not a genetical imposition for V.
squamata.
