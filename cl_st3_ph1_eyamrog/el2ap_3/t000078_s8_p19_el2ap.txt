We proposed a two-stage approach, incorporating a priori identification of
candidates for sub- centrality into the hedonic price model. Thus,
in the first stage, it identifies all candidates for SBD
using an ESDA-type analysis. In the second stage, we run
the hedonic house price model considering explanatory variables distances to
SBD candidates (identified in the first stage). The second stage
strategy permits controlling the overidentification derived from using employment level
concentrated in the polygon centroid. Thus, in both approaches, one
can test the null hypothesis that each region is not
an SBD.
