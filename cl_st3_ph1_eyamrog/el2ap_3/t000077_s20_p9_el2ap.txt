The labor market is made up of very heterogeneous workers
regarding general characteristics (observable or not); and, workers of different
demographic types, or sub- populations of workers, are differentially sorted
into jobs across sectors and occupations. That said, the inequalities
in probability observed so far are probably reflected in other
types of sociodemographic inequalities.
