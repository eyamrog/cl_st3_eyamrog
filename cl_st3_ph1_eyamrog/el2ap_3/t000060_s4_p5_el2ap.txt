Politeness strategies are also valuable mechanisms that speakers use to
soften the illocutionary force of what they say. They are
sociointeractional strategies which are associated with people’s necessity of gaining
approval from others as well as the need to safeguard
their autonomy. Among these strategies, we point out the use
metadiscursive expressions, evasive forms, paraphrases, and markers that indicate higher
or lower degrees of speaker’s involvement, among other linguistic phenomena.
