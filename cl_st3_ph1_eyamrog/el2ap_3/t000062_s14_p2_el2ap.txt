Sample units - To compare the effect of H. coronarium
on the assembly of soil spiders, was used a method
similar to that of Robertson et al. (2011). However, in
this study, only three treatments were performed, with three replicas
each. The difference between this study and the one conducted
by Robertson et al. (2011) is because in PEFI, the
constant removal of invasive plants maintains few areas affected by
H. coronarium. The study areas were chosen because they are
close and hoping to eliminate the different influences from distant
areas. In the protected area, it is the only environment
that presents H. coronarium in a satisfactory amount for the
three treatments. The three treatments include: (1) dominated areas (DA),
where only H. coronarium covers the soil; (2) intermediate areas
(IA), where H. coronarium covers 50% of the ground; (3)
free areas (FA), where there is no occurrence of H.
coronarium. Each sample unit has an area of 100 mÂ²
(figure 2 a-c).
