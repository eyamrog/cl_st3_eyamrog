Data collection - Spiders were collected using pitfall traps. The
pitfall traps were set up using a 2 – liter
plastic pot. Each pot has an opening of 18 ×
13 cm and is 12 cm deep (figure 2 d).
They were filled with 500 ml of water mixed with
neutral detergent and removed in 48 hours after installing them.
In total 45 pitfall traps were collected each month for
one year (five in each replica). They were positioned as
follows: one of the pots in the center of the
sample unit, another four at 1.5 m from each vertex
towards the center (figure 3).
