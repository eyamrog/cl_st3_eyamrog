Regarding crop cultures, in the production of in vitro seedlings
of strawberry (Grout & Millan 1985) and grape (Amancio et
al. 1999), the growth under a PAR of 90 µmol
m-2 s-1 generates photosynthetically capable leaves with light saturation point
around 450 µmol m-2 s-1, while in V. squamata, the
growth under maximal PAR of 412 µmol m-2 s-1 still
showed shade effects. In the Cerrado species Pouteria gardneriana, there
were clear differences in the structural development of leaves growing
under PAR varying from 75 to 150 µmol m-2 s-1,
but the authors had not shown data of wild plants
as a control (Leite et al. 2017).
