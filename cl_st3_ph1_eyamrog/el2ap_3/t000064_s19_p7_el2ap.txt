With respect to stomata disposition, V. squamata leaves were amphistomatic,
and the stomata on the abaxial face were mainly found
in crypts, which reached about a quarter of the leaf
thickness (figure 6 a). These features were more noticeable in
the control group and in the garden plants. It is
noteworthy that in vitro plantlets did not develop stomatal crypts,
and the stomata were rudimentary (figure 6 d). Additionally, plants
in the greenhouse process had smaller and shallower crypts (figure
6 e) than those of field plants (control group) with
fully developed stomata (figure 6 a).
