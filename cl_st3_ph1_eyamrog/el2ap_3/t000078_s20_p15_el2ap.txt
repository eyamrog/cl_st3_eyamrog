Duranton and Puga (2015) point out no agreement regarding a
consistent definition of SBD. Many authors have considered the contiguity
areas as an empirical strategy to overcome the challenge of
quantifying SBD (Guiliano and Small, 1991; McMillen, 2003; Baumont, Ertur,
and Gallo, 2004). Following the theoretical models, areas whose estimated
coefficients are statistically significant and negative are taken as SBD.
Under this criterion, from the estimated model, the city of
SÃ£o Paulo presents seven SBDs, which give a negative and
statistically significant global effect (direct and indirect).
