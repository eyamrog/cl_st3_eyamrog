As dictated by the Council of Science Editors (2018), the
World Association of Medical Editors (2009 Jul 25) and the
International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (2021), editorial decisions should
depend solely on the work’s validity and interest to readers,
not on any competing interests the editors might have, or
the journal owner’s commercial interests. Journals owned by universities and
other research institutions can be particularly challenging in this regard,
because editors may even have the same competing interests as
the journal owners. Such journals’ scope can be expected to
substantially overlap the parent organization’s research activities, and some of
the journal editors, reviewers and authors can be expected to
be affiliated with said organization. As reviewed by Barradas and
Pinheiro (2016), such endogeneity may bias the peer review process
to be more lenient and to incorporate less diverse points
of view, undermining the journal’s contribution to the scientific record;
also see Sarigöl and colleagues (2017).
