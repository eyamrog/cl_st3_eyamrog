Benjamin (1987) approaches mimesis mostly from texts about childhood (their
own and in general), showing great concern with this stage
of life for the development of rationality. Susan Buck- Morss
(1995: 288, own translation) states that "[no modern thinker, with
the exception of Jean Piaget, has taken children more seriously
in developing a theory of cognition." However, while Piaget focused
on the gains resulting from the progressive advance of abstract
thinking replacing childish thinking, considering the use of explanations fantastic
such as cognitive error, Benjamin sought to understand the losses
resulting from the gradual abandonment of mimetic behavior by entry
into adulthood (Schlesener, 2019).
