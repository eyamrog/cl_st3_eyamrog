(Topsoil physical properties under a riparian forest in Central Brazil:
infiltration and penetration resistance). Plant composition, diversity and structure of
riparian forests of Central Brazil are well known. However, little
is known about soil physical properties under these forests. This
knowledge is important as a baseline for biodiversity restoration and
ecosystem services that occur in riparian zones. In order to
bridge this gap, here we assessed the infiltration capacity and
soil penetration resistance in a plinthic soil under gallery forest
in Planaltina, Distrito Federal, Brazil. We measured infiltration capacity (Mini-Disk
infiltrometer) and soil penetration resistance (Stof penetrometer) following linear transects.
The plinthic soil had high infiltration capacity and low penetration
resistance. Our infiltration estimate is in the middle range when
compared to other permeability studies in tropical forests. Like their
counterparts, high biological activity along with the lack of disturbance
are the likely explanations for such high topsoil permeability to
water.
