Regarding legal interaction and conversation analysis, Stokoe and Edwards (2010,
p. 155- 156) argue that “the various interactional contexts that
comprise legal institutions (e.g., courtrooms, police stations, emergency services, prisons,
legal documents, lawyers’ oﬃces) have provided materials” for ethnomethodology1 and
conversation analysis since their beginnings. The authors postulate that “interaction
in places such as courtrooms can constitute some of the
most highly consequential moments in people’s lives”.
