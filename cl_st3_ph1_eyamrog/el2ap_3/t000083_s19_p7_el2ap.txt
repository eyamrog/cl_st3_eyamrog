Table 3 presents the corrected item-total correlation data and the
internal consistency of the SBS assessed from Cronbach's Alpha (α)
and McDonald's Omega (ω) coefficients, including their values if items
were deleted. Overall, satisfactory levels of alpha and omega (between
0.60 and 0.89; Toledo Junior et al., 2018; Bowling, 2005;
Tavakol & Dennick, 2011) were verified not only among the
factors, but also among the SBS items. It is worth
mentioning that the omega values were slightly higher than the
alpha values, in some factors and items. The overall reliability
of the scale was α=.80 and ω =.81. The individual
reliability scores for each of the 5 factors in the
α and ω rates were above 0.78. For some items,
it was observed that the α and ω coefficients decreased
if the items were deleted, indicating they were robust items
and necessary for the reliability of the scale. The column
"Corrected Item-Total Correlation" presents the correlations between each item and
the total score of the scale. In general, these correlations
should not be lower than 0.3 in order to have
reliability. Items that do not correlate with the total decrease
the reliability of the questionnaire. In the present study, values
above 0.52 were observed, confirming the reliability of the scale
(Hair et al., 2009).
