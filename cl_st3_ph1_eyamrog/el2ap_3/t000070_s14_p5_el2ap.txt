Germination percentage data (%) and germination speed index (GSI) were
daily obtained until the 15th day of cultivation. Germinated seeds
were considered when they presented embryo swelling, seminal envelope rupture
and, light green colour as a sign of active metabolism.
The GSI was calculated according to Maguire (1962) and the
formula: GSI= âˆ‘ (Gi/ni) where: Gi = number of germinated
seeds and; ni = counting day.
