According to Romanos (1979), rent prices are underestimated in areas
where sub-centers exist. Also, many cities have more than one
business center and/or multiple subcenters. Additionally, as would be expected
by monocentric models, property price gradient does not decrease monotonically,
relative to the city's CBD, but in polycentric model does.
