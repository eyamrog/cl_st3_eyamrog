Our results are in line with the effects observed in
the municipality. Studies for the metropolitan area of São Paulo
report findings close to ours, even using a different methodological
approach, different sizes of polygons, and different databases. Siqueira (2014)’s
findings report seven SBD for the metropolitan area of São
Paulod (SPMA), being three of them in the municipality of
São Paulo localized in the historic center, Paulista Avenue –
Faria Lima Avenue corridor and Santo Amaro. Campos (2018) reports
three SBD for the SPMA, but only one in the
MSP, aggregating all the seven SBD found in this paper.
Siqueira (2014) and Campos (2018) identification strategies are based on
the relative concentration of employment for SBD identification, justifying why
they found less SBD than us. In this way, their
findings may be labeled as global SBD (relative to the
SPMA), while ours is local SBD (relative to the MSP).
