We found infiltration capacity of the plinthic soil under riparian
forest to be in the middle range compared to estimates
carried out in other tropical forests such as the Amazon
and Atlantic Forest (table 1). Generally, high soil biological activity
(e.g. continuous litter production, root growth and decay and soil
fauna) along with the lack of disturbance (e.g. human and
animal trampling, use of heavy machinery) leads to high infiltration
in forest soils (Bruijnzeel 1990, Salemi et al. 2011).
