The global financial crisis of 2007-2008 triggered mainstream’s new reorientation
on capital account liberalization. Different from the threshold approach on
financial openness that marked the period between the emerging economies’
crises and the global crisis, several mainstream studies now provide
an explicit defense of capital controls in their recommendations. Before
proceeding, two caveats are noteworthy. First, capital controls and (macro)
prudential policies on capital outflows aim to restrict the outflow
of domestic resources rather than restricting the repatriation of invested
resources from non- domestic agents. For example, during the 1990s
and 2000s several emerging economies intensified their liberalization of domestic
capital outflows. In other words, they released their restrictions on
cross-border operations (such as loans and investments) of domestic residents,
such as banking institutions, non-banking financial institutions (such as institutional
investors), non-financial companies, and physical persons. The second caveat is
that the mainstream literature began to adopt the typology used
by authors such as Ostry et al. (2010; 2011) and
Ghosh et al. (2014), who classify capital controls as regulatory
measures that discriminate according to the investor’s residency. For example,
the imposition of an IOF tax (the Portuguese acronym for
‘Tax on Financial Operation’) on capital inflows coming from foreign
investors is a capital control under this typology. Macroprudential policies
do not discriminate according to the investor’s residency, but do
discriminate according to the currency denomination of the cross-border financial
transaction. For example, a raise in the degree of restrictions
on banking institutions in forming open positions on foreign currencies
is a macroprudential policy (classified as ‘foreign exchange related measures’).
