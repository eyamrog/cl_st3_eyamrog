In comparison to yes/no questions, tag questions and declarative questions
are strongly biased towards a conﬁrmative answer and so they
are more coercive (Huddleston & Pullum 2002, p. 881-894). Apart
from coercing witnesses into type-conforming replies, these types of questions
oﬀer one more obvious advantage to counsels: they are perceived
as statements and as such help to change the questions
into evidence (Hobbs, 2003b, p. 486–87). Tag questions and declarative
questions thus become a powerful tool which enables counsels to
give evidence on behalf of witnesses and reduce witnesses to
the role of minimal responders. But it is tag questions
that are considered by some scholars (Woodbury, 1984, p. 205;
Berk-Seligson, 1999, p. 36) to be the most coercive type
of questions as they have an additional pragmatic meaning: they
imply that the person knows that the questioner is right.
Gibbons (2003, p. 101), however, warns of relying heavily on
the form of questions since intonation, or tone of voice,
is equally important for deﬁning the degree of coerciveness.
