The use of mimicry is not unique to human beings,
there are studies within the biological sciences on the manifestation
of this behavior in other animals (for example, flies, butterflies
and snakes) (Futuyma, 1997; Ricklefs, 1996). Perhaps the best known
case is of the chameleon that, when feeling threatened, changes
the color of its own skin to blend in with
the environment. Another form of mimetic behavior, present, for example,
certain species of fly, is not linked to environmental imitation,
but rather the representation of predator – an insect's attempt
not to be identified as prey. In addition to the
basic function of protecting life, mimicry appears as a form
of communication and learning through imitation present in mammals, having
been scientifically verified, at least in one species of bear,
in a few primates (Taylor et al., 2019) and in
the human being, “by far, the most qualified to learn
by mimicry” (Wulf, 2016: 555).
