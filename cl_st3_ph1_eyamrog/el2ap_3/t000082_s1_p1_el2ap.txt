A fundamental fact about mutualisms relies on the fact that
partner species often harbor some individuals that benefit from the
use of resources and services of the interaction without providing
any positive feedback to the other player. The role of
these cheaters on the evolutionary dynamics of mutualisms has long
been recognized, yet their broader consequences to the community level,
and beyond species they interact with, is still poorly understood.
Because mutualisms form networks that often involve dozens to hundreds
of species in a given site, indirect effects generated by
cheaters may cascade through the whole community, reshaping trait evolution.
Here, we study how harboring cheating interactions can influence coevolution
in mutualistic networks. We combine a coevolutionary model, empirical data
on animal-plant mutualistic networks, and numerical simulations to show that
the higher frequency of cheating interactions lead to the formation
of groups of species phenotypically similar to each other and
distinct from other groups, generating higher trait disparity. The resulting
clustered trait patterns, in turn, change the patterns of interaction
in simulated networks, fostering the formation of modules of interacting
species. Our results indicate that cheaters in mutualisms contribute to
generate phenotypic clusters in mutualisms, counteracting selection for convergence imposed
by mutualistic patterns, and favoring the emergence of modules of
interacting species.
