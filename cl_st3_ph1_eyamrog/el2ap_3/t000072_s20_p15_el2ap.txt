The mean of Shannon's indexes in plots R was lower
(1.90) when compared to plots I (2.20), but they were
not significantly different by t test (p> 0.05). The Shannon-Weaver
indexes for the two regions did not exceed the value
of 3, and according to Souza et al. (2013), areas
with values less than 3, are recognized as low diversity.
Due to the forest structure being consistent in areas of
mature forests, decreasing the seed rain, the diversity and density
of the seed bank tend to decrease, causing the species
that integrate the community to build a seedling bank (Souza
et al. 2006).
