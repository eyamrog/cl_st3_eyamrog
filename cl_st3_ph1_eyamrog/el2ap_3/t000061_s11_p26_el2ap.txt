The USR experience offers a privileged opportunity to learn metaphysical
concepts by visualizing their materialization through actions. This is very
important from an educational point of view, because the concepts
of the moral field, due to their metaphysical character, are
impossible to be known objectively (Lavelle, 2018), imposing serious difficulties
for researchers in training. In this sense, it is possible
to affirm that USR is close to what Benjamin called
experience of thought, through the visualization of images loaded with
meaning. In this way, the USR experience allows beginners to
visualize the researchers' moral behaviors and to form mental images
of the application of ethical concepts in practical situations, such
as taking a stand in the face of concrete ethical
dilemmas.
