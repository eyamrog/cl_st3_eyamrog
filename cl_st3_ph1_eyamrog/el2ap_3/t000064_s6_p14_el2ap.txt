After this initial period, not only the leaves become photosynthetically
active, but also they often show anatomical changes, such as
cellular growth with reduction of stomatal density and differentiation of
hairs (Van Huylenbroeck et al. 1998, Kaur 2015). Anyway, in
both functional groups the in vitro shaded leaves cannot tolerate
the environmental light intensities, but the newer leaves formed under
those intermediary light intensities tend to present a light compensation
point and a light saturating point like the wild plants,
as well as a photo-dissipating apparatus better developed (Van Huylenbroeck
et al. 1998, Kaur 2015).
