In this study, we applied the exploratory factor analysis to
assess the dimensionality of the scale in the Brazilian version,
followed by the confirmatory factor analysis (structural equation model). We
initially chose to use the exploratory factor analysis because the
population in the present study (adolescents) had an age range
different from the population in which the original instrument was
validated (young adults). Therefore, it was necessary to investigate whether
the dimensionality of the scale was maintained. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO)
test and Barlett's test of sphericity were performed to confirm
the adequacy and possible factoring of the data (Schumacker &
Lomax, 1998). The principal components extraction method with Oblique rotation
was applied. The communalities were also evaluated to verify how
much the variance (correlation) of each item was explained by
each extracted factor.
