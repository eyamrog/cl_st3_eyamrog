We examined the overlap among journals using OJS that appear
on both the Beall’s and Cabell’s lists (Table 4). We
found that 82 journals (0.3 percent of the OJS total)
appear on both lists, led by journals published in India
and the United States.11 Taken together, a total of 521
journals using OJS appear on one or both predatory lists,
amounting to 2.0 percent of the journals known to be
using OJS. Between the two lists for those journals using
OJS, Cabells appears to have a somewhat greater focus on
the Global South, while the country differences between the two
lists are likely the result of publishers’ journal sets.
