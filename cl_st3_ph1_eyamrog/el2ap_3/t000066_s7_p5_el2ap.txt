LACE Research Groupâ€™s actions derive from its fundamentals in Applied
Linguistics (AL), an area of study that questions everyday attitudes
to life through language and how it constitutes human beings
and all their activities in social interactions. It is crucial
for AL studies to take a critical stance towards social
issues, building bridges with different areas such as Education, Psychology,
Sociology, Philosophy, among others (Moita Lopes, 2006). The aim of
AL is to combine new discourses and ways to create
reality through multiple forms of saying, feeling, acting, that is
to say, being in the world. LACE is also aligned
to a socio-historical-cultural approach in a vygotskian conceptualization, which will
be discussed in this paper.
