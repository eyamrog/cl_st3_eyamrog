Plants of the genus Vellozia (Velloziaceae) grow in the African
and South American savannahs and are more frequent in open
vegetations, such as rupestrian fields or Cerrado stricto sensu (Ayensu
1969, Coetzee 1974, Mello-Silva & Menezes 1999, Batista 2016). They
are highly resistant to fire and drought (Owoseye & Sanford
1972) and show stems capable to absorb water (Oliveira et
al. 2005). Often, they produce resins and several secondary metabolites
of medicinal interest (Quintao et al. 2013), including the inhibition
of the venom of snakes (Tribuiani et al. 2014). Some
species have been used as ornamental (Souza 2005), and it
can be attributed to their big showy flowers and peculiar
architecture. Unfortunately, these plants are somehow endangered by the extractivism
and expansion of crop cultures.
