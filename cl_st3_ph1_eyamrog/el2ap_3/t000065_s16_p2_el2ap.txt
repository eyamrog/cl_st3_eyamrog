Data collection was inspired, at first, by the International Corpus
of Learner English (ICLE). CorIFA and ICLE carry similarities regarding
task variables, such as, task medium, genre, topic and task
setting. CorIFA compilation started with written tasks: argumentative essays, such
as those in ICLE. Students were asked to write essays
based on previously chosen topics, such as the internet, feminism,
science and technology. Teachers asked the students to write their
essays in class or at home, submitting them by email.
Essay length, another task variable, was different from ICLE, since
the latter required texts to be from 500 to 1000
words; whereas CorIFA allowed, at that time, 200 to 300-word
essays. Regarding the learner variables, ICLE and CorIFA participants' age
range and learning context are similar; the data for both
corpora come from university students who have learned English in
a non-English speaking country. The main differences between the two
corpora, however, entail first language, academic level, discipline and language
proficiency. At this point, we will refer only to first
language as the other characteristics will be fully discussed in
the following section. ICLE encompasses subcorpora with English texts from
speakers of a variety of languages (e.g.,Chinese, Turkish, Portuguese, French,
etc.) while CorIFAâ€™s participants are mainly Portuguese speakers18. Finally, the
consent forms were in printed format when the corpus started
being collected with basic information from the students, for instance,
name and enrollment number. As consent forms were modified later
on by the research group to collect more metadata, the
texts collected in 2013 were discarded.
