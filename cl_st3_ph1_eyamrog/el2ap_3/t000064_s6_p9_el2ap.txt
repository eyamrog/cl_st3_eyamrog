According to the data herein presented, even under low PAR
intensities there is chlorophyll formation. However, the photosynthetic ability depends
on the development of other elements that require higher light
intensities. According to Leite et al. (2017), in Pouteria gardneriana
the chlorophyll fluorescence did not vary substantially among the plantlets
grown under the different PAR intensities, but the anatomical structure
was more developed under the higher ones. In grape, the
leaves grown in very low PAR intensities (as of 20
Âµmol m-2 s-1) release oxygen, indicating that the photosynthetic apparatus
is capable of carrying out photolysis of water, but they
are not capable of carrying out net absorption of carbon
dioxide (Amancio et al. 1999).
