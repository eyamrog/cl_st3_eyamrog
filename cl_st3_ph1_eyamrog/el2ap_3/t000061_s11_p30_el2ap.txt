The relationship of mimesis with education can also be thought
of from the etymological origin of the verb to educate
(e/ducare, from the Latin), as a process of leading (d√∫cere)
the child outside of himself (e-ex) (Martins, 2005) and prepare
her to live in the world. To that extent, the
educational process is a driving process.
