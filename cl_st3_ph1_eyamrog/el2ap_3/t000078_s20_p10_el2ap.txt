Controlling for all SBD candidates in the econometrics estimation, we
are assuming for cross- commuting. That is, workers have the
possibility of choosing distant business centers even though there are
business centers closer to their homes (Plaut and Plaut, 1988;
Wrede, 2015). This specification is more flexible when compared to
the approach of choosing the nearest center of the worker's
residence as proposed by Fujita and Ogawa (1982) and Baumont,
Ertur, and Gallo (2004).
