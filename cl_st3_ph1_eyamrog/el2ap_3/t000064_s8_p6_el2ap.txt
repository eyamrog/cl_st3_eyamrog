To improve the in vitro protocol, it is important to
know physiological aspects of the wild species and seedlings at
each one of their phases (Kaur 2015). The leaf photosynthetic
curves are one of the most important physiological features to
be known, as these curves can point out the ability
of a small plant in establishing an autotrophic metabolism (Leite
et al. 2017).
