Combining these discourses, as I have shown, Scholz asserts that
there is no alternative to a paradigm shift in military
spending to become a military power adequate to the country’s
importance in Europe, which in his plans translates into a
budget that puts Germany into third place in global defense
spending, after the US and China. This Germany as military
power discourse is also centripetal, through naturalisation (BAXTER, 2011, p.171;
DEETZ, 1992): there was “no other response” to arms delivery,
it is “clear” that we must spend more on defense
and NATO “must” be strong to protect German freedom and
democracy in the future, a legitimisation by stoking fear of
a hypothetical future (REYES, 2011). Due to the powerful position
Germany holds within the EU, Scholz announces this threat not
just for Germany, but expects all of Europe to follow
his paradigm shift.
