The conventional economic policy mix also underwent important shifts in
the last few years. Facing the strong capital inflows that
characterized emerging economies in the post-global crisis period, De Gregorio
(2014) defends the adoption of an economic regime based on:
i) a flexible exchange rate to avoid one-way speculations and
arbitration, ii) an inflation targeting regime, and iii) a sustainable
fiscal balance. However, the author points out that these measures
can be insufficient to counter an excess of financial fluxes,
to the extent that the use of capital controls becomes
necessary. Nonetheless, adopting regulatory measures must support the adoption of
sustainable macroeconomic policies, according to the authorsâ€™ prescriptions.
