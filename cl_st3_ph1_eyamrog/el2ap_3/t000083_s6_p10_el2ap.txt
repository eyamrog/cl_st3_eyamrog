It is worth mentioning that so far there are few
studies on selfie behavior and especially on selfie addiction, and
most of what has been published academically (both theoretical studies
and empirical research) are from researchers in India. This is
because India and other Asian countries are countries that have
more social media users (Lamba et al., 2016).
