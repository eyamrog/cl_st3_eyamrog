In conclusion, the method of immersing the seeds in liquid
nitrogen for a period of 24 hours is sufficient to
promote the interruption of metabolism. Hence, one can infer the
tolerance potential and its indefinite storage projection. The use of
the cryopreservation method for V. reitzii seeds, with direct immersion
in liquid nitrogen, revealed to be an effective mechanism for
long-term ex situ conservation system. Accentuating, however, the importance of
the seed maturity state and water content, as important factors
for the success in the conservation process. Moreover, V. reitzii
seeds have a natural desiccation process in the mother plant
and present the ability to tolerate desiccation and storage, key
features to be classified as orthodox seeds.
