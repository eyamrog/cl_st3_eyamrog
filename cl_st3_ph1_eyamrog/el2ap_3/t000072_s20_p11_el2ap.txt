Among all the species identified here, 55% have zoochoric dispersion
syndrome, 30% anemochoric and 12.5% autochoric. Zoocory is extremely important
for maintaining the interaction between fauna and flora, which in
turn fosters the conservation and functionality of forest fragments (Garc√≠a
et al. 2011). Generally, in conserved fragments and large areas
of tropical forest, the zoocory dispersion is predominant (Sansevero et
al. 2011, Jesus et al. 2012). As the study area
is a fragment with little anthropic disturbance, we can say
that it is in a good state of conservation, since
more than half of the species have zoochoric dispersion syndrome.
Other studies carried out on remnants of semideciduous forest also
found values close to the present study, in which more
than half of the sampled individuals have dispersion carried out
by animals (Silva et al. 2019, Neto et al. 2020).
