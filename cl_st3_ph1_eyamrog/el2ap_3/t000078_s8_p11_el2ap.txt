The emergence of sub-centers is linked to the de-agglomeration process
benefits, despite the advantages offered by CBD concentration. Firms in
the suburbs can count on some advantages, such as lower
cost of land, access to intercity and interstate roads, access
to workers over longer distances, and lower wages (because the
firm would not have to compensate for commuting). Communication would
be viable if firms in the SBD were located close
to the CBD and communication innovations were available. Although business
diversity may be lower in SBD, the negative effect of
non-diversity would be diluted if low transport costs and land
offers near CBD were available. Another advantage of the sub-
center size is that large SBD offering employment and shopping
opportunities reduces household dependence on the center (McMillen, 2001b).
