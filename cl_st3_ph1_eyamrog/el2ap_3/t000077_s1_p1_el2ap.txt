There is some consensus that the pandemic can widen pre-existing
inequalities in the labor market and that an essential issue
concerns the unequal possibilities of working remotely. This study analyzes
inequalities in remote work in Brazil through descriptive analyzes and
Probit regressions using PNAD COVID-19 microdata. We have found that
workers with the least possibilities for remote work were the
poorest, males, rural residents, non-whites, youngest, without college education, self-employed
or wage workers from the private sector and agriculture workers.
An important part of that stems from differences in selection
into occupations; however, some variables maintained important independent effects, especially
the college education and the labor income. The pandemic, regarding
the possibility of remote work, had the effect of widening
the existing inequalities, favoring the wealthier, more educated, and more
formalized workers and imposing on the others the need to
choose between employment and income versus risk of contagion.
