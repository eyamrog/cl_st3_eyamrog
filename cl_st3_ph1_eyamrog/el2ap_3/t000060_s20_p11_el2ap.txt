According to Coulthard and Johnson (2007, p. 29), “in real
courtrooms, when questioning witnesses, many of the lawyer’s turns are
‘face threatening acts’, which challenge the witness”. In agreement with
the authors, “the lawyer’s role in the courtroom (particularly in
cross-examination) allows him to interfere with and put pressure on
the witness in pursuance of the interactional goals of the
Crown or State, by whom he is given his power”.
