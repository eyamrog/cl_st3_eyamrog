The corpus shows (Table 2) great differences among registers as
far as word average length. It consists of six written
registers, each ranging in length from 225.39 to 1,564.50 words.
The one which surpasses all the others in terms of
length in words is the research article. This reflects the
reality of the linguistic features among registers, especially related to
their nature, which includes physical mode, setting, production circumstances, etc.
(Biber & Finegan, 1994), in which some registers do require
more words than others. Moreover, since writers must include several
sections in a research article, which Biber and Finegan (1994,
p. 131) call “standard four-part organization (Introduction, Methods, Results and
Discussion - IMRD)” the number of words will certainly surpass
other registers in our corpus. The shortest type of text
produced by CorIFA participants was the abstract. This register, which
could also be understood as part of a research article,
has a clear communicative purpose to sum up the article,
presenting its aims, methodology, results, and conclusion. Oftentimes, journals and
conferences limit the number of words in an abstract (Swales
& Feak, 2009) imposing on the writer the need to
be concise.
