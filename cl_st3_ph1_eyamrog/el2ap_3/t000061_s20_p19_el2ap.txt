In the room the teacher tells me what I have
to do and how to do it. Scientific initiation taught
me to try new methods, in which I could myself
see directly within the research, the advisor supports me and
always helps me with any questions I have, but the
path and each step new to take comes from me,
and the classroom doesn't give me that. (USResearcher 23, Questionnaire,
