To select the corpus, we have gathered all the material
available on the Internet regarding Arias’s trial: we have watched
all the videos of her trial available on YouTube, as
well as the transcripts released to the media on the
Internet. It is important to stress that according to the
multi-platform news and information media company USA TODAY, during Arias’s
sentencing retrial, she testified without the presence of the media,
