Although relevant, these latter differences in remote work participation are
not as expressive as the ones regarding the different employment
statuses – with 34.58% participation for public sector and 5.15%
for the self-employed – and the schooling levels – with
0.45% participation for those without formal education and 34.38% for
those with college education. In the case of schooling, the
great leap in participation in remote work occurs with the
achievement of higher education.
