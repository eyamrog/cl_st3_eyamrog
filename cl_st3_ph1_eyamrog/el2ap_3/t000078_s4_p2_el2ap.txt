Due to the SBD impact on the economy, the sub-centers
identification has long been evaluated in the international literature. However,
in Brazil, few studies on sub-center identification in large cities
exist. Therefore, in this article, we proposed a two-stage identification
approach, seeking to eliminate the discretion of the suggested empirical
methods. The first stage aims to identify candidates for SBD
using an ESDA approach. In the second stage, using a
Hedonic Spatial Price Model is an innovation to the proposed
methods since it allows the testing of the alternative hypothesis
of the existence of SBD.
