This first moment of mimesis is of fundamental importance. During
this period, the family and the school tend to be
the two main institutions responsible for introducing the world to
the new generations, much more by example (and the environment
they provide) than by word. Due to the absence of
the worlds most structured conceptual understanding in, children appropriate reality,
through the incorporation (and imitation) of behaviors. Rites, gestures, (re)actions,
are marked in the unconscious of children and are carried
throughout life. If the environment is one of repression of
the body, mimesis remains in its archaic character of immediate
and unstable instance, based on the fear of difference, which
tends to generate, according to the analysis of Gagnebin (1993:
76) on Adorno, a “process social of perverse identification… [,
in which] the individual fear of regression to the amorphous
would engender a totalitarian collective regression, whose most complete expression
is fascism”. The totalitarian regimes intensify the archaic fear of
the different, offering as an antidote the identification with the
charismatic leader, endowed with an easy speech that explores, precisely,
superficial appropriations of reality.
