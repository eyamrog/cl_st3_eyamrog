Remarks. Bagrobdella vansteenbergei differs from all other species already described
by the size of its hooks which are all of
almost the same length (pair I being only slightly longer
than the others), when they are of different size in
all the previously described species (including B. vanhovei sp. nov.)
(Fig. 10). More, the trapezoidal piece was not observed in
the 17 individuals (15 Hoyerâ€™s mounted and 2 preserved in
ethanol), it may be thought to be absent in this
species, even if it is usually slightly sclerotised and hard
to observe. The ventral anchors are slightly holed. Its male
copulating organ has a unique shape within Bagrobdella spp. (sub-
terminal opening and no membrane surrounding) (Fig. 11).
