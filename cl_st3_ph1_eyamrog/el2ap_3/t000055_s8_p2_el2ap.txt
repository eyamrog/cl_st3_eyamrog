The data set reported here are the metadata for each
individual sand fly specimen deposited in FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB since 1953. Our
dataset has 57 fields describing for each individual sand fly
specimen their: (i) taxonomy (kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus,
specificEpithet, infraspecificEpithet, scientificName, scientificNameAuthorship, taxonRank, vernacularName, typestatus), (ii) collection details,
including the collectors (recordedBy), the collection date, trapping method, trap
identification number, collection site description (occurrenceRemarks, eventDate, eventTime, habitat, samplingProtocol,
samplingEffort, eventRemarks), (iii) geolocation data (country, countryCode, stateProvince, county, Island,
waterbody, locality, locationRemarks, decimalLongitude, decimalLatitude , georeferenceRemarks), (iv) catalogue reference
data (occurrenceID, catalogNumber, OtherCatalogNumbers). The associated data for each physical
object in our collections has a paper card with many
fields referring to specimen provider, location, quantity of specimens, etc..
The data from these cards have been digitized by a
dedicated member of the collection staff since 2010. The data
are provided in the Darwin Core format [10]. Our data
is available in the Sistema de Informação sobre a Biodiversidade
Brasileira (SiBBr), an online platform that integrates data and information
about biodiversity and ecosystems and is the Brazilian Node of
the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) [11], an internationally-recognized resource
for collation of biological occurrence data, where our data set
has been submitted, and is publicly available for use by
others at: https://doi.org/10.15468/sxcpfp.
