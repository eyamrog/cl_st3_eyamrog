The Internet has transformed the way we communicate. The addition
of the Web and digital technologies has spawned the emergence
of a language phenomenon in online communication, something genuinely different
from other communication modes, which includes − ‘speech + writing
+ electronically mediated properties’ (Crystal, 2004, p. 48). Initially different
types of language appeared in asynchronous communication, such as emoticons
(short for emotion icon) to express one’s feelings or mood
− :-) for happy, and :-( for sad, today’s technological
advances have enabled the creation of emojis, widely used in
social media and interactions via SMS, Messenger, and mobile applications
like WhatsApp, to express feelings and other forms of meanings.
