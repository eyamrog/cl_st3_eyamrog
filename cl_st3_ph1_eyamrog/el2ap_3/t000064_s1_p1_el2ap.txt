(Leaf anatomy and photosynthetic parameters of Vellozia squamata Pohl (Velloziaceae)
grown under different light intensities along in vitro cultivation). The
present work evaluates photosynthetic parameters and the leaf anatomy of
plants of Vellozia squamata Pohl (Velloziaceae) in each phase of
in vitro production, with wild plants serving as a control.
The anatomical approach was done for the leaf middle portion.
The photosynthetic curves were obtained with an infra-red gas analyzer.
The in vitro plantlets showed the thinner and poorest developed
leaves, the wild plants had the thickest and most developed
leaves, and the plants in acclimatization showed intermediate features. The
physiological pattern was similar, and the in vitro plantlets were
not capable of net carbon absorption. The young seedlings at
the garden showed a maximal net carbon assimilation rate inferior
to the wild plants. In conclusion, the light intensity for
the in vitro phase should be adjusted to produce seedlings.
