Future studies should investigate the duration and long-term consequences of
the COVID-19 pandemic on both scientific and health care careers
in order to assess the real impact of the so-called
“Fauci effect”. Some studies had begun to emerge looking at
the effects of the pandemic on perceptions of science, scientists
and health care workers, as well as the impact on
professional careers in other parts of the world. It will
be of value to compare the results observed in this
study with those conducted in different parts of the world,
where adolescents experienced other public health policies, pandemic messages and
COVID-19 outcomes.
