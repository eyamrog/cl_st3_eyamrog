Objective: to translate, adapt, and identify the psychometric properties of
the Selfitis Behavior Scale (SBS). Methods: online study conducted with
261 Brazilian adolescents. The translation and cross-cultural adaptation process followed
international guidelines, resulting in an adequate scale with face, content
and construct validity. Results: The five factors explained 78.2% of
the total variance. Confirmatory factor analysis (structural equation model for
latent variables) showed an adequate fit of the five-factor model
with Ï‡2= 2.42 p=0.001, GFI=0.92, AGFI= 0.89, NNFI= 0.92, TLI=
0.96, CFI= 0.93, RMSEA= 0.041. All factor loadings were statistically
different from zero (0; t >1.96, p<0.05). The total internal
consistency value by Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega was above
0.80 and the internal consistencies of each factor were above
0.79. Conclusion: This is the first Brazilian study to evaluate
the psychometric properties of a selfie scale. The SBS proved
to be a reliable and valid instrument to assess selfie
behavior.
