The anatomical immaturity is linked to the immaturity of the
photosynthetic apparatus. In the present case, the in vitro plantlets
have inability of net carbon absorption, together with a high
leaf transpiration rate, indicating dysfunctional stomata. A given light intensity
may be enough for the plain development of the leaves
of a given species, but insufficient for others. Thus, comparing
with other Cerrado species cultivated in vitro, Lippia rotundifolia develops
leaves capable of liquid carbon absorption under PAR of 78
µmol m-2 s-1 (Hsie et al. 2019), while Hanconia speciosa
and Hyptis marrubioides showed carbon absorption under PAR of 50
µmol m-2 s-1 (Costa et al. 2014).
