Regarding employment status, the difference that stands out is in
the public sector. Therefore, inequalities in participation in remote work
between salaried workers in the formal and informal sectors seems
to actually reflect the difference between the public and private
sectors (with the public sector over-represented in the “formal” sector).
In the private sector, the difference in remote work participation
between those with (9.52%) and without a formal contract (8.42%)
was small.
