According to Goffman (1974, p. 9), “the term face is
the positive social value a person effectively claims for himself
by the line others assume he has taken during a
particular contact”. Politeness is a social phenomenon which aims at
maintaining harmony in interaction to establish cordiality in relationships among
participants. Schneider (1998, p. 51) states that politeness is usually
expressed in grammatical structures by means of “pragmatic conventions recognized
by a given society as having some intentional illocutionary force
(e.g., please..., could you... etc.)”.
