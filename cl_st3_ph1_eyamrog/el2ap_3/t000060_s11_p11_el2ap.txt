In the example above, the delay in the answer indicates
that the first part of the pair does not necessarily
receive the second part that the speaker expects. Yule (1996,
p. 78) observes that “delay in response symbolically marks potential
unavailability of the immediate (i.e., normally automatic) expected answer. Delay
represents distance between what is expected and what is provided.
Delay is always interpreted as meaningful”.
