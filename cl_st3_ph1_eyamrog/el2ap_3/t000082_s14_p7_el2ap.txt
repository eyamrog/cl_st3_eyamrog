We use 24 empirical mutualistic networks available at the databases
Web of Life (http://www.web-of-life.es/) and Interaction Web Database (http://ecologia.ib.usp.br/iwdb/index.html). These
24 networks include eight plant-pollinator networks, eight plant-frugivore networks, and
eight ant-myrmecophyte networks. Each network is represented by an adjacency
matrix (A) in which each species is represented by a
single row and a single column of the matrix; each
element of this matrix represents the presence or absence of
the corresponding animal-plant interaction. Ant-myrmecophyte networks are commonly less connected,
more modular, and less nested in comparison to seed dispersal
and pollination networks, while seed dispersal networks are usually more
nested and have a higher connectance than pollination and ant-myrmecophyte
networks (Supporting Information, Guimar√£es 2020).
