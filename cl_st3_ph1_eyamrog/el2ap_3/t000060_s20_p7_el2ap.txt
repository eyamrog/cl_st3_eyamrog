The discourse marker correct contributes to make the interviewee agree
with the interviewer’s version of events, as the authors argue:
“the attorney’s questions are designed to elicit ‘yes’/’no’ conﬁrmatory answers”
(Holt & Johnson, 2010, p. 34). In this case, Arias
does not offer an explicit affirmative answer, as expected by
Martinez (“Yes, that is correct”), but she does not entirely
exclude his version either. When she says, “that makes sense”,
the interviewer achieves his aim since she does not disconfirm
his interpretation.
