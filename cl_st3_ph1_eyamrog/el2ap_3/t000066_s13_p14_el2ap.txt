As a result, facilitators organized the sequence of activities, namely
the opening and closing songs as well as the way
play and talk were aligned to the topic of global
collaboration. Thus, the young professionals who were guests to the
workshop could relate to their personal experience and, hopefully, engage
with others during the workshop − and after it −
to start thinking of creative ways to increase their power
of action. The idea was to create a space in
which the group could expand their conatus as quoted by
Spinoza (2003, III, Prop. VII), that is, the potential to
improve and nurture one’s existence.
