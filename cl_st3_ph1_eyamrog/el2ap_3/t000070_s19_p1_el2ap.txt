The different periods of fruit collection, days after floral anthesis
(DAA), revealed statistically significant water levels (table 1). The highest
(p <0.05) average percentage of water (17.6%) present in the
seeds was observed in seeds collected at 120 DAA. Seeds
collected at 135 and 150 DAA did not show statistical
differences in moisture content.
