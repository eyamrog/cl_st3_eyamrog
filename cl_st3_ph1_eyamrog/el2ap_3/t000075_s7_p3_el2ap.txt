In this sense, this paper analyzes the recent evolution of
mainstream economics on capital account liberalization and capital controls, focusing
on its new evidence and theoretical reorientation, especially on the
post-global crisis period. For this, it was carried out a
literature review of the most reputed papers about financial openness
and capital controls published in prestigious journals besides the National
Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) working papers and International Monetary
Fund (IMF) papers, among others. We then argue that the
new mainstream models represent a new phase in its theoretical
approach on the regulation of capital flows. So much is
that currently capital controls are admitted with fewer restrictions by
the mainstream economics, being conceived as important instruments available to
central banks. A new phase, but not a turning point,
given the still existing restrictions on the use of these
regulatory measures on permanent basis, which greatly derive from its
remaining differences with the Keynesian approach on the contemporaneous International
Monetary and Financial System.
