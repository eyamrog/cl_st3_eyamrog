The utilitarian sense of Western culture has caused many forms
of life to be converted into bio- resources for science
and production, as shown by the cases of ayahuasca, the
poison dart frog and peyote. The intentions of appropriation are
not limited to the economic aspect, but have transcended the
epistemological field, establishing a border between scientific knowledge, obtained by
research carried out in laboratories, and the so-called traditional knowledge.
