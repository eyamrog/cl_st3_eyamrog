(Seed bank analysis and species similarity in the Guarnição da
Aeronáutica de Pirassununga (São Paulo State, Brazil)). Riparian forests suffered
from forest fragmentation, which in turn promote the change in
the pattern of seed dispersion and modification of soil seed
bank. The aim of this study is to indicate the
main species that make up the seed bank of a
stretch of riparian forest of the Mogi Guaçu River continued
to a fragment of semidecidual forest, located in the Guarnição
da Aeronáutica de Pirassununga. It was delimited ten plots of
10 x 10 m. Four soil samples was collected by
plot with a 25 x 25 cm template. Samples were
packed in greenhouse for seed germination and monitored every 15
days for six months. Altogether, 494 individuals from 19 families
were sampled, distributed in 30 genera and 40 morphospecies. Diversity
and distribution of species in the fragment is homogeneous and
can be used as source of propagules for forest restoration.
