This study described the distribution, among health science journals indexed
in LILACS, of two recently proposed indicators of endogeny. One
indicator (the proportion of articles by the most prolific author)
was higher and another (the Gini coefficient) was lower in
LILACS journals than in MEDLINE ones. Both differences disappeared after
adjustment for journal size.
