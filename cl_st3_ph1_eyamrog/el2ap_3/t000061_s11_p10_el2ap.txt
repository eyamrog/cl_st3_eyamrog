For this reason, Adorno and Horkheimer (1985) see education as
the central dimension for understanding modern society, as it instrumentalists
the process of clarification, especially from formal education institutions. For
the authors, in a critical tone, “a pedagogy that makes
children unaccustomed to being infantile – is the very condition
of civilization” (Adorno and Horkheimer, 1985: 85). The modern educational
process, instead of departing from mimesis for the construction of
rationality, starts with the repression of mimetic behavior to control
childish impulses.
