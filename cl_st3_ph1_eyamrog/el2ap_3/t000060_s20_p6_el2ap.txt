researchers exploring legal talk (and other institutional environments such as
news interviews) have noticed patterns in the design of questions
that are associated with particular actions in these environments: and-
and so-prefaced questions (Johnson, 2002), formulations (Heritage & Watson, 1979;
Heritage, 1985) and reported speech (Philips, 1986; Matoesian, 2000; Galatolo,
2007). These devices, recurrently employed in questions (and sometimes in
other parts of trial discourse such as the use of
reported speech in summing up), are often central to one
of the main aims of legal discourse: to establish the
culpability of one or more parties involved.
