The plants growing in the greenhouse were exposed to a
maximum light intensity of about 412 µmol m-2 s-1, that
is, a little bit less than half of the light
saturation point of the wild (control) plants (table 1). The
maximum carbon absorption rate was inferior to the wild and
the garden plants, but the shape of the light response
curve followed a pattern as expected. To the greenhouse plants,
although the light saturation point was of about 200 µmol.m-2.s-1,
the carbon absorption rate was kept under higher light intensities,
suggesting there was no photoinhibition (figure 2).
