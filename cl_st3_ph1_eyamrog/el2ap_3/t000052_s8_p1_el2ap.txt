Lake Tanganyika is, with 12 million years, the oldest of
the East African Great Lakes, (Cohen et al. 1993). It
stands out from the rest of the world’s lakes by
its richly diverse ichthyofauna, which make it an important hotspot
for the world’s freshwater lacustrine biodiversity (Coulter et al. 1986).
The 3200 km2 of Lake Tanganyika’s surface area is unevenly
distributed among four countries, including the Democratic Republic of the
Congo in the West (14800 km2 or 45%), Tanzania in
the East (13500 km2 or 41%), Burundi in the North
(2600 km2 or 8%) and Zambia in the South (200
km2 or 6%) (Cohen et al., 1993; Fermon, 2007) (Fig.
