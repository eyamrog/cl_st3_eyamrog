The primary motivation for using a spatial econometric model stems
from extensive empirical literature that considers space as an intrinsic
feature of the housing market, and consequently, its essentially spatialized
database (Arnold, 1987; 1998b). Also, the importance of testing the
spatial association is related to two effects overlapping, once that,
spatial heterogeneity can generate spatial autocorrelation, and spatial autocorrelation can
generate spatial heterogeneity.
