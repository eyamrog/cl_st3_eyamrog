In this study an amount number of individuals was sampled,
but most of them were young, making it impossible to
identify at a specific level, the species richness observed is
not associated with H. coronarium, unlike V. minor observed in
Bultman's study & De-Witt (2008), but may be associated with
the anthropic impact of the region due the study area
is bordering a dirt road with constant movement of vehicles
and a large flow of residents and employees who work
in the PEFI's research areas and suffers from the constant
removal of this invasive plant.
