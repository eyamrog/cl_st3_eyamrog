The result that more educated workers are more able to
perform remote work is also consensual (Bartik et al., 2020;
Gallacher; Hossain, 2020; Yasenov, 2020); and specifically for Brazil, GÃ³es
et al. (2021) found that more than 70% of the
remote workforce had at least completed college education. Bartik et
al. (2020) found that the level of participation of workers
with higher education in an industry has almost the same
predictive power of the possibility of remote work as the
measure of Dingel and Neiman (2020), which has done a
remarkably good job in predicting the industry level of remote
work. According to these authors, this result shows the strength
of the link between being an educated worker and being
able to work remotely. Yasenov's (2020) results for the US
and Gallacher and Hossain's (2020) results for Canada also indicate
that the main difference occurs when completing a college education.
