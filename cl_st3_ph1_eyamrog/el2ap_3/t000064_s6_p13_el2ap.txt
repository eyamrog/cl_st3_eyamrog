According Van Huylenbroeck et al. (1998) and Kaur (2015), the
in vitro propagated plants can be divided into two functional
categories regarding the transition from in vitro to greenhouse phase:
plants with photosynthetically incapable, in a which the leaves serve
only as reservoir organ for the sprouting, and those photosynthetically
active, whose leaves have at least partial development. In this
last group, it is often seen that during the first
days of transplantation there is a typical stress acute response,
such as great rates of transpiration and respiration and eventually
a reduction in the chlorophyll content (photobleaching; Van Huylenbroeck et
al. 1998, Kaur 2015).
