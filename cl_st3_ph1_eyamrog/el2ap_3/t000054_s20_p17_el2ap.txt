This is not the only plant that produces mescaline, since
several South American species of the genus Trichocereus also synthesize
this alkaloid (Cassels & SÃ¡ez 2018). However, Lophophora williamsii is
the only one associated with cultural practices of shamanism, divine
rites, and dream visions among the Mexican peoples of the
Tarahumaras, the Coras and especially the Huicholes (Clavijo 2018).
