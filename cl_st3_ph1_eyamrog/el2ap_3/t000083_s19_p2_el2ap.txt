The process of translation and cross-cultural adaptation was carried out
in an adequate manner, prioritizing the semantic and conceptual equivalence
of the items, confirmed by the back-translation of the scale,
and the operational equivalence in which the scale was applied
online (as in the studies by Balakrishnan and Griffiths 2017;
Lin et al., 2019) with the same number of questions
and the same response options. In the online study with
the pilot sample, participants were asked to indicate how clear
and understandable each item was, in addition to an open
field for suggestions. After analyzing the answers regarding the scale's
intelligibility, it was found that no suggestions were made to
the scale's items, and that all participants mentioned that the
questions were clear and easy to understand. Thus, the face
validity of the scale was verified, in which no difficulties
in understanding the items or suggestions for improving the scale
were presented by the adolescent participants, confirming the adequacy of
the cross-cultural adaptation. Based on this result, the scale was
considered suitable for use in larger samples (Balakrishnan and Griffiths,
2017).
