In this study investigates the effect of H. coronarium on
the assembly of soil spiders in the Parque Estadual das
Fontes do Ipiranga (PEFI). It was expected that H. coronarium
influences the abundance of spiders, because the species forms monospecific
populations, as well as V. minor, cited above in the
publication by Bultman & De-Witt (2008). The importance of the
study about the diversity of spiders is even greater once
considering that the area suffers from constant removal of land,
the place is also a passage of vehicles and research
groups, that is important to study the diversity of spiders
in this region. The results expand the knowledge of ecological
interactions between spiders and plants and reinforce the attention that
we must have in relation to the introduction species in
those conservation units.
