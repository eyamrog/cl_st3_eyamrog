In Brazil, the movement to regulate research is the object
of significant (and justified) non- conformity on the part of
researchers in the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH)4, especially against
Resolution No. 510/2016 of the National Health Council (NHC). This
resolution is the main normative instrument for regulating research in
SSH in Brazil, although it comes from a health-related body.
The NHC norm disregards and disrespects the particularities of the
methodological responses built over the years in research in the
SSH, marked by the development and adoption of ethical care
based on the specificities of scientific fields.
