All scientific articles/books were assessed in order to obtain data
from 32 standardized variables of Darwin Core Terms (Darwin Core,
2022) (Table 1). These variables were subset in four types
to identify the Dataset, to describe the essential information about
specimens condition and quantity, capture location and methods, and taxonomic
status for each observation (Table 1).
