The use of verbs was the focus of two other
CorIFA CIA studies. While Guedes (2017) concentrates on the most
frequent academic verbs present in argumentative essays in CorIFA, comparing
verb usage to that in British Academic Written English corpus
(BAWE), Nunes and Orfanò (2020) analyze verbs in research abstracts
within the system of transitivity in passive that-clauses, contrasting the
learner corpus results to a Lingua Franca Corpus22 composed of
abstracts from soft and hard sciences. Little action verb variation
and low frequency of adverb + verb collocations in CorIFA
essays as compared to BAWE showed Brazilian learners' lack of
familiarity with the academic register (Guedes, 2017). As for the
verbs used in abstracts, Nunes and Orfanò (2020) also found
the learners’ choices of verbs inadequate. They use more mental
verbs (conclude, verify and assume) while expert writers show preference
for relational verbs (show, demonstrate and reveal). Another observed result
is that learners delete the conscious agent and thus remain
distant from the findings they discuss. Researchers, on the other
hand, seem to be more actively conscious of the object
of study they investigate, showing more intellectual authority. Developing authorship
is a skill that needs to be included in EAP
classes; corpus-driven linguistic analysis like this one and the study
on verb variation and collocations can inform teachers in their
practice.
