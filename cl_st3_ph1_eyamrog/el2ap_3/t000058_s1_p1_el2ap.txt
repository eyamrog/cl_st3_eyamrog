Biological collections are of extreme importance in acquiring knowledge of
the biodiversity of a specific environment. In this article, we
organise, list and catalogue the adult specimens belonging to the
family Culicidae housed in the Parasitology Collection of the Basic
Pathology Department at the Federal University of Paran치, southern Brazil.
To this end, a data bank was created, containing information
on the taxonomy and collecting of each sample. The culicids
were collected using different methodologies in 18 municipalities in the
state of Paran치, between 1967 and 1999. There are 5,739
catalogued specimens of which 4,704 (81.96%) are identified at a
specific level, with a diversity of 205 species. Of these,
18 are new recorded samples for the state of Paran치
and 3 for Brazil. This being the case, we propose,
in honour of the 30 years dedicated to the study
of culicids in the state of Paran치, the creation of
the Ana Leuch Lozovei Entomological Collection, which is composed of
insect vectors or potential vectors, of agents that cause diseases
in humans.
