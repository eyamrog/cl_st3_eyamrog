The poster (Figure 1) gives the names of the three
professors that planned the workshop and acted as facilitators, during
its course, as well as the names of the professionals
who were invited by them to participate as guests. In
total, eight professionals attended it. They were in Brazil, the
USA, and Ireland at that time. One of these professionals
was Kenyan, three were Brazilians living abroad, and four were
Brazilians from different regions of the country. Given the international
character of the workshop, which was open to whoever subscribed
via the GPB website, English was the chosen language for
interaction. Some of the activities in the workshop are presented
and discussed in the sections that follow.
