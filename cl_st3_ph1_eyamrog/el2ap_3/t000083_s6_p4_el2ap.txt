In addition, the sample size meets the parameters required for
more advanced statistical analyses (minimum of 200 participants) as suggested
for confirmatory factor analysis (Watkins, 1989). The Structural Equation Model
applied in the factor analysis, showed excellent fit, CFI (0.93),
TLI (0.96), RMSEA (0.041), GIF (0.92), AGIF (0.89), NNFI (0.92).
The Cronbach's α and McDonald's ω reliability of the factors
and overall reliability of the scale proved quite satisfactory with
coefficients above 0.80 (α) and 0.81 (ω), respectively (Bentlet, 1995)
