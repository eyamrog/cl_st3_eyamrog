A descriptive evaluation of housing price, employment specialization, wage, and
education provides the best understanding of each SBD, underlining the
heterogeneity amongst sub-centers. Considering all identified SBD, the average prices/m²
is R$ 8.230,00, and the standard deviation is R$ 2.295,00.
Housing prices are higher in Pinheiros than elsewhere. Figure 4
displays a positive correlation between average prices/m² and distance from
CBD, while monocentric models point out a negative correlation. Such
behavior supports our findings in terms of the existence of
sub-centers.
