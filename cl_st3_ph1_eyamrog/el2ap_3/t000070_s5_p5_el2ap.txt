In the present study, it was observed that the anticipation
of seed collection, at 120 DAA, resulted in a lower
average germinative percentage (70%), when compared to seeds collected in
the desiccation period (89.6%), at 150 DAA (table 1). Another
important factor observed was that the cryogenic process did not
affect the germinative power of the seeds. Yet, the moisture
content was a key factor in survival and germination. Likewise,
the cryopreservation of IpÃª-Roxo (Tabebuia impetiginosa (Mart. ex DC.) Standl.)
seeds, with the moisture content of 12.5%, 8.4%, and 4.2%,
maintained vigour and germination capacity. However, at 18.3% of moisture
content, there was a decline in germination (Martins et al.
2009).
