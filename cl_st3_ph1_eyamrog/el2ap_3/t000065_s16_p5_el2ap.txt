CorIFA is composed of texts written by undergraduate and graduate
students from different courses at the Federal University of Minas
Gerais. These students are registered in one of the five
English for Academic Purposes (IFA)19 subjects created in 2012 as
part of a set of initiatives to expand and enhance
the internationalisation process of the university. Students register according to
proficiency levels, ranging from intermediate to advanced (B1-C1), following the
Common European Framework of Reference20 for Languages. As part of
each subjectâ€™s assessment, students from each level are required to
write to a specific academic register (Table 1). Before being
accepted in one of IFA subjects, students' proficiency level must
be checked. Students may either submit scores on a standard
proficiency test, such as TOEFL or IELTs, or take an
internal placement test.
