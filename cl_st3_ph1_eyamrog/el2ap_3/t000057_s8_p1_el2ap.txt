Gallery forests, also known as riparian forests, occur along small
streams in the Cerrado biome of Brazil (Ribeiro and Walter,
1998). These forests are well known in terms of plant
species composition, diversity and structure (Felfili 1994, Felfili 1995, Nóbrega
et al. 2001, Silva Júnior 2004, Silva Júnior 2005, Moretti
et al. 2013, Cabacinha & Fontes 2014, Pio 2018). Generally,
they present a high biological diversity. One of the possible
explanations for such diversity might be attributed to heterogeneity of
soil types over which these forests occur which include both
well and poorly drained soils (Haridasan 1998). For example, they
might occur on oxisols (latossolos) and histosols (organossolos) (Resck &
Silva 1998). Since these soil types present a clearly distinct
hydric behaviour, they not only affect plant community but are
also expected to influence the ecosystem service of buffering zones
that riparian forests play. For instance, riparian forests under histosols
might not reduce surface runoff from uplands in the wet
season since these soils would be water saturated during this
period following the runoff generation (as described in Dunne &
Black 1970a,b). So, it is important to understand hydrological functions
of these forests under different soil types.
