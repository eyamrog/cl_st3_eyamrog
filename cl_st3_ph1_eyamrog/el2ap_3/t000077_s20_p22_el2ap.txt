A reduced, but counterintuitive effect was estimated for private sector
workers with a formal contract, who were 0.98 p.p. less
likely to be in remote work compared to the benchmark,
the private sector worker without a formal contract. This negative
effect appears when the fixed effects for types of work
are included, showing that the greater probability of remote work
for formalized employees also arises from a composition effect. In
fact, the literature dealing with the issue of informality in
the labor market in the context of Covid-19 points out:
first, that these jobs are more vulnerable and the losses
were relatively greater in the informal market (Balde et al.,
2020; Bridi, 2020); and second regarding the lower possibility of
remote work, they point out that this is due to
the type of tasks prevalent in informality, in which physical,
manual and contact-intensive work are over-represented (Hatayama et al., 2020;
Garrote Sanchez et al., 2021). After the Types of work
F. E. were included, our result shows that the presence
of a formal contract slightly reduces the likelihood of remote
work.
