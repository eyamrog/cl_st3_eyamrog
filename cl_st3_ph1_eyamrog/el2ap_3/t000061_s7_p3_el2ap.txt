In addition to continuing to move the indispensable efforts to
resist unfounded normalization, it is time for the educational field
to strengthen and affirm formative proposals for the construction of
researchers' moral autonomy as an alternative to the inadequate normative
response. Aiming to contribute with arguments for the strengthening of
a formative answer to the question of ethics in research,
this article rescues the concept of mimesis to think about
it in the scope of the undergraduate scientific research (USR)
experience as a possible path for the moral formation of
researchers.
