In Latin America, the immense existing biodiversity is associated with
the abundance of enormous practically unknown regions and the presence
of indigenous peoples, in some cases uncontacted. Along with the
profusion of life forms that have been preserved over the
years, the danger of genetic erosion caused by indiscriminate exploitation
stands out on the one hand, and on the other
the attempts at appropriation by institutions and natural persons, at
the expense of the prejudice of the communities that inhabit
those areas, of their habits of life and of their
cultural practices. The purpose of this article is to reflect
on these issues, based on the documentary information published by
various authors. The examples presented also demonstrate that the region
can take advantage of biodiversity for its own development, under
a bioeconomy model, in which the efforts of science, education
and production institutions coexist, supported by government policies of respect
for the environment, indigenous populations and the legal protection of
heritage.
