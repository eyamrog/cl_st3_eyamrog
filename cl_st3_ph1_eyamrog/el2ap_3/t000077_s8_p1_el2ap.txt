Covid-19's first case was confirmed in Brazil on February 26,
2020. At the beginning of April 2021, the country reached
more than 13 million confirmed cases, with more than 330
thousand deaths (Brazil, 2021). The pandemic started when the country
was slowly emerging from the deepest and longest recession since
the Second World War (Oreiro, 2017) and, in the second
quarter of 2020, Brazilian GDP fell 9.7% compared to the
previous quarter, the biggest drop in the historical series, which
started in 1996 (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics -
IBGE/National Accounts, 2020).
