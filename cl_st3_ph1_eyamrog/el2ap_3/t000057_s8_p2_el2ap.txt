Like many riparian forests elsewhere, such ecosystems are expected to
carry out important buffer functions including retaining sediment, nutrients and
human-made chemicals such as pesticides. The assumption behind is that
riparian soil under these forests present high topsoil permeability which,
in turn, diminish or extinguish surface runoff from uplands (Salemi
et al. 2011). To date, there is no documentation on
basic topsoil permeability for these riparian forests. Understanding such properties
under specific physical settings may allow to infer whether they
carry out the expected functions they are expected to. Moreover,
such information may serve as a baseline which, in turn,
may help scientists and managers to predict the impacts of
inappropriate riparian occupation and restoration (see Brito et al. 2019;
Pereira et al. 2021).
