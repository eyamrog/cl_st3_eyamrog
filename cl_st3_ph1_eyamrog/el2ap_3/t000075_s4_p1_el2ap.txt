This article concludes that the orthodox models that favor full
capital account liberalization in the 1980s and 1990s were gradually
contradicted by empirical studies showing flaws in these models, as
well as by studies that demonstrate the desirability of capital
controls. In response to all of this evidence, new orthodox
models that support the use of capital controls stand out.
These new models are therefore ex-post theoretical constructions, while the
former ones were ex-ante theoretical models. For this theoretical reorientation
process, the period after the global crises of 2008 was
fundamental due to the negative effects on national economies, especially
emerging economies, generated by the instability of international capital flows.
