CIA study results can enhance practitioners’ understanding of their students’
needs; nevertheless, teachers may choose to collect their own class
corpus as a Do-It-Yourself Corpus (DIY corpus)16 or create data-driven
learning (DDL) (Johns, 1991) activities based on ready-made corpora (e.g.,COCA,
BNC17) or on their DIY corpus. It is worth mentioning
that DDL (Johns, 1991, 1994) allows students access to corpus
data and concordancing softwares as part of their language-learning process.
Using the figure of Sherlock Holmes as a metaphor, Johns
(1997) explains that learners are seen as detectives as they
are encouraged, for example, to search and identify grammatical rules,
vocabulary meaning, collocations and lexico-grammatical patterns, to name a few.
Following Johns' (1991, p. 4) DDL format "identify-classify-generalize", learners who
participated in Lee’s research (2011) had the opportunity to learn
and practice prepositions through the analysis of concordance lines. They
explored a corpus comprising texts from J.K.Rowling's book Harry Potter
and the Philosopher' Stone, concentrating on verb-preposition collocates. DDL activities
raised students' awareness of the use of prepositions while it
helped them to figure out the uses and functions of
certain phrasal verbs. DDL contributed to students' language acquisition, proving
to be a good way to prepare for exams, as
it created a learning context with more enthusiasm and student
autonomy (Lee, 2011).
