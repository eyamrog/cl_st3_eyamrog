One of the biggest challenges today is the conservation of
the remaining forest fragments (Loyola 2014), since Brazil holds one
of the largest biodiversity on the planet (Forzza et al.
2012). The lack of information about where efforts should be
concentrated and what strategies of restoration should be taken are
often an obstacle to biodiversity conservation. In this sense, studies
on the seed bank in remaining areas can provide important
information about their state of conservation and for restoration actions
in their surroundings, with the starting point which are the
main vegetable species present there. Thus, the objective of the
present study was to indicate the main species that make
up the seed bank of a stretch of riparian forest
of the Mogi Guaçu River continued to a fragment of
semidecidual forest, located in the Guarnição da Aeronáutica de Pirassununga
(São Paulo State, Brazil).
