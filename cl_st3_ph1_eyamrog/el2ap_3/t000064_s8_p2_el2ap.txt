The plants of the genus Vellozia produce a large amount
of small seeds that are transported by wind, they are
resistant to high temperatures, and show high and quick germinability
(Menezes 1977, Oliveira et al. 1991, Garcia & Diniz 2003,
Palhares 2004, Garcia et al. 2007, Jacobi & Sarto 2007,
Mota & Garcia 2013, Vieira et al. 2017). However, Alves
(1994) observed that the growth is very slow in Vellozia
species, ranges from about 0.5 to 2.0 cm per year,
and almost no young plants were seen in the field,
in spite of their high frequency in the Campo Rupestre.
The plants of about 1.80 to 3.30 m were actually
centenary plants, therefore, although they occupy the open fields, they
are not pioneer plants but establish later in the ecosystem,
i.e. they are climax plants (Alves 1994).
