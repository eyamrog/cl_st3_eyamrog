One possibility of ascertaining the low productivity is considering the
years of study of workers in each SBD. Table 9
allows an evaluation of the schooling composition of workers in
each SBD and a correlation with this wage behavior, although
with little rigor. In Pinheiros, 42% of the employees have
at least finished high school (complete high school + incomplete
higher education), and 34% have at least a completed college
degree. Itaim Bibi (higher wage composition of workers amongst all
identified SBDs) presents 40% of the workers with at least
complete high school and 40.4% with at least a bachelorâ€™s
degree.
