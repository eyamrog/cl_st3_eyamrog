Finally, research is needed to provide a more rigorous description
of the relationship between journal size and authorship concentration indexes.
If an ideally non-endogenous journal increased or decreased in number
of signed articles, how would that affect the indexes? Such
knowledge would enable more precise interpretation of the indexes, and
allow one to confidently compare countries or subjects, as well
as to investigate whether larger journals are generally less or
more endogenous than smaller ones.
