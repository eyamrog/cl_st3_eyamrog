Most scientific journals in the region are owned by universities
(Fischman et al. 2010; Beigel et al. 2021), raising the
possibility of journals in LILACS being even more endogenous than
those in MEDLINE. On the other hand, the region has
a longstanding tradition of including endogeneity in journal evaluations (Amorim
et al. 2015; Rozemblum et al. 2015; Paz Enrique et
al. 2016; Boas et al. 2021), and the lack of
significant endogeneity is one of criteria for journal selection in
LILACS (Suga 2019). The overall endogeneity of LILACS-indexed journals should,
thus, result from the tension between these two factors. The
objective of this study was, then, to describe both authorship
concentration indexes among health sciences journals indexed in LILACS, and
to compare them to what Scanff and colleagues (2021) found
in MEDLINE.
