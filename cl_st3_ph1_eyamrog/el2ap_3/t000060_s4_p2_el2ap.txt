It is important to call attention to the use of
so-prefaced questions and the markers correct and right functioning as
tag questions in some prosecutor’s formulations. So-prefaced questions were very
useful to challenge and transform the defendant’s account by putting
pressure on her to reformulate it in a more convenient
way for the accusation. In relation of the discourse markers
and tag questions above, we observed a degree of coerciveness
in the cross- examining lawyer’s questioning. These types of questions
are more coercive as they oﬀer a limited possible set
of answers and, pragmatically speaking, they imply that the interlocutor
knows that the questioner is right.
