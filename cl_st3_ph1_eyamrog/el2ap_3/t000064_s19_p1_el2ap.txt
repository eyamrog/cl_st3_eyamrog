Physiological parameters and light response curves - The physiological parameters
obtained are summarized in table 1 and figures 1 to
4 show the curves of light response of CO2 absorbance.
In the control group and in the plants growing in
the garden, at a light intensity of 900 µmol m-2
s-1, the leaves reached about 90% of the maximum carbon
absorption rate. Since most of the leaves had peaked in
the carbon absorption rate, this was considered as the light
saturation point. For the light intensities of more than the
double of this point, the carbon absorption rate was kept,
hence there were no signs of photoinhibition (figures 1, 2,
4). In the open groups (wild plants and garden plants),
the carbon absorption rates under the natural sun light (PAR
of about 2,000 µmol m-2 s-1) were the same as
the maximal rates measured by the IRGA (maximal PAR of
1,600 µmol m-2 s-1), so the data of Amax were
grouped together.
