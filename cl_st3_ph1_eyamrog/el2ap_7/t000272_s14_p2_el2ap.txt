The plant material was dried at 40 ± 1 °C.
The ethanolic extract (EE) was obtained by percolating bark powder,
using ethanol (Merck - Darmstadt, Hessen, Germany) as solvent for
five days in three cycles at 30 ºC, and concentrated
in a vacuum rotary evaporator (40 °C, 55 rpm) until
complete solvent removal was achieved.
