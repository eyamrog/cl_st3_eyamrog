The endothermic peaks of the events observed in the DTA
coincide with the degradation temperature ranges found in the sample
TG curves. No events found were exothermic. The more polar
fractions have discrete endothermic peaks when compared to the peaks
of the EE and the fraction of ethyl acetate. Therefore,
it is possible to deduce that both the hexane fraction
as well as the chloroform fraction require less heat to
begin their degradation.
