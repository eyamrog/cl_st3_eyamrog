Before embarking upon the operating room, different aspects should be
considered, such as the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection at your
facility, expected length of stay, and possible surgical complications and
other clinical comorbidities that may add additional morbidity/mortality. If surgical
treatment is deemed necessary, informed consent should be obtained addressing
the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Ideally, surgical patients should be
tested pre-operatively for COVID-19, although this strategy is not possible
in our institution where just symptomatic patients are being tested.
