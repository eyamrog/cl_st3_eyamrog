On the world stage, although distant from our daily lives,
the beginning of 2020 was characterized by an outbreak of
a mysterious pneumonia caused by a variation of coronavirus, whose
first case was reported in December 2019 in the city
of Wuhan, China.1 The increase in the number of cases
quickly characterized the infection as an outbreak, so that, at
the end of January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO)
declared the situation as a public health emergency of international
interest.1 This is a virus isolated for the first time
in 1937, and in 1965 was described as coronavirus, due
to its profile under microscopy, similar to a crown.2 Between
2002 and 2003, the WHO reported 774 deaths due to
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). In 2012, 858 deaths from
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers-CoV) were confirmed in Saudi Arabia,
both complications caused by members of the coronavirus family.2 Eight
years later, 2019-2020, the world found the mutating RNA virus
expanding, especially asymptomatically, as an emerging infection, with milder symptoms
than SARS-CoV and Mers-CoV, but with greater transmissibility, thus generating
considerable impacts on health systems.1 Most people are infected with
coronavirus throughout their lives, especially children, in which case α-coronavirus
229E and NL63, β- coronavirus OC43 and HKU1 are recognized.2
However, they can occasionally cause serious respiratory diseases in the
elderly and the immunocompromised.2-3
