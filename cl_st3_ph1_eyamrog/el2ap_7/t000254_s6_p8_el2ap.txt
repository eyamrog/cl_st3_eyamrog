Climbers were the most dynamic life form, as was also
observed by Wright (2004), Phillips et al. (2005) and Laurance
et al. (2014). Penhalber & Mantovani (1997) noticed that plants
of that synusia were the ones that produced the largest
number of propagules in the park, which would favor higher
recruitment. On the other hand, their low seedling establishment, especially
in more mature forests (Engel 1998, Schnitzer 2005), would reduce,
in the long term, recruitment to classes of larger sizes,
as noted herein. Although less abundant, climbers had the largest
decrease in basal area, accounting for 36% of the total
decrease in the community, unlike plants from the shrub-tree synusia
which had higher recruitment than loss in the basal area
during the period. This decrease in lianas could be related
to the maturing of the area. However, only the largest
lianas, already established (> 2.5 cm dbh), had higher mortality
than recruitment and a tendency to decrease (lambda < 1).
