Data Analysis - Calculations were carried out to determine mortality
and recruitment for the plant community, as well as growth
rates and the proportion of dead and recruited basal area
for the plants with > 2.5 cm dbh over the
period of 6.5 years (March 2006 to September 2012). The
relative growth and the distribution of shrub and tree diameters
were also evaluated. For the dynamics of the basal area,
recruiting was considered as the sum of the relative value
to the basal area of plants recruited in 2012 and
the relative value to the growth of the remaining plants
from 2006.
