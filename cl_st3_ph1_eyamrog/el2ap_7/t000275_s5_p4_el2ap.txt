Healthcare professionals who are in contact with COVID-19 patients have
a higher risk of becoming infected13. Procedures that disseminate aerosols,
such as NIV, high flux nasal cannula, mask ventilation and
intubation are of higher risk14. Lima et al.15 have recently
published a technical note directed to surgeons and emergency physicians
on how to perform cricothyroidostomies and tracheostomies while providing safe
alternatives throughout the procedure. Similarly, minimally invasive operations use carbon
dioxide flux to increase intra-abdominal pressure, and therefore they can
spread aerosols. Richard et al.16 have demonstrated environment contamination by
blood and other body fluids during fast pneumoperitoneum deflation, under
regular conditions.
