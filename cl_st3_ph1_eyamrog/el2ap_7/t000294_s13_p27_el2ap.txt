South Korea, which had its first case registered on January
20, 2020, adopted contact management between suspects and infected people
for epidemiological investigation. It also implemented a system for assessing
the risk of exposure among people in all places where
there were confirmed cases (after the onset of symptoms) and
classified the contact persons based on that risk. In addition,
to eliminate the possibility of exposure to infection in the
places visited by the confirmed patient, it performed appropriate disinfection
of areas that could harbor environmental contamination.29 Thus, systematic investigations
were successful due to a rigorous control process based on
scientific principles and continuous feedback assessment cycles to contain the
outbreak. Although there were more than 10,600 patients as of
April 18, new infections have been abruptly reduced in recent
weeks.26
