Regular application of cleaning and disinfection procedures is a common
strategy used to control the installation of pathogenic microorganisms. Despite
only few studies retrieved, this systematic review revealed that there
is a wide variety of disinfectant agents used for the
pacifier disinfection, which have benefits advantages and disadvantages. Many of
the procedures described in the articles were adapted from other
protocols, since there are different protocols used for general decontamination
of products and utensils for human use [20]. From the
analyzed articles, nine strategies of microbial control were identified, being
used solutions and products with thermal, chemical, mechanical and chemomechanical
actions.
