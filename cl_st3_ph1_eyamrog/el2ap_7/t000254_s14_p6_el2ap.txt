Vegetative or fertile branches were collected, when present, from shrubs
and trees for herborization and identification. Climbers were not botanically
identified in order to avoid interference from the collection of
stem on the climbersâ€™ dynamics, a single collection could cause
the death of the monitored individual (Sheil 1995a). This means
that only the structure and dynamics of this synusia, as
a whole, were evaluated, without performing floristic study for this
synusia.
