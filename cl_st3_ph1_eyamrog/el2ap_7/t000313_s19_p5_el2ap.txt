Cat (Felis catus) and dog (Canis lupus familiars) are of
special interest due to their close relationship with humans. Their
ACE2 orthologues present at 77% and 73% of identity with
the human ACE2 respectively, considering the 30 variable sites. Both
species present identity with other species belonging to the Carnivora
order, such as Leucine (L) at position 24. However, they
also show differences from each other at positions 25, 34,
427, and 559, two of them are a target for
positive selection (34 and 559; Table S3). In other words,
50% of the differences between the ACE2 binding sites of
cat and dog are taxon-specific variants that may be connected
with specific functions of the ACE2 protein in each of
these two domesticated species.
