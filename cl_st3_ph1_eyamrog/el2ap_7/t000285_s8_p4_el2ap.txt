This finding suggests a possible misdiagnosed scenario that can lead
to serious implication of delayed diagnosis, wrong treatment and poor
allocation of resources (2,4). However, it is not clear yet
how the outcomes of a possible syndemic will be expressed
in patients and health systems. Thus, we aim to systematically
review the literature searching for evidence that describe the clinical
presentation, severity and prognostic of a coinfection SARS-CoV-2 and Arboviruses,
in order to provide support for decision- makers in future
scenarios of a possible syndemic.
