Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).
The BDI is composed of 21 items. Each item consists
of a series of four statements based on the severity
of depressive symptoms. The score of each item varies from
0 (minimum score) to 3 maximum score). The overall score
of the instrument range from 0 to 63. Scores ranging
from 0-9 indicate minimal/no depressive; 10-18 indicate mild to moderate
depressive symptoms; 19-29 indicate moderate to severe depressive symptoms, and
30-63 indicate severe depressive symptoms20. For this study, depression was
dichotomized into no depressive symptoms (0-9) or prevalent depressive symptoms
(10-63)20.
