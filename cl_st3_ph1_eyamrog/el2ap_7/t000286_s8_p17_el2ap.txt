The Granger causality test results showed that FDI inflows and
GDP affected the Turkish economy in different way. These two
variables experienced a decline over this period. However, they revealed
that tourism income is a significant source of revenue for
Turkey. Similarly, Dinçer (2015) used the reflections in the monetary
policies and (REER) during the 2000s in order to analyze
the dynamics of the macro interpretation in the Turkish economy.
Dinçer reached the conclusion that the volatility in the Turkish
currency was comparatively reduced in the aftermath of regulations introduced
in the finance sector in recent years. Dinçer also added
that the contribution and added value of the tourism sector
to the national economy was an important factor influencing this
trend, since tourism is one of the major sectors in
Turkey that are open to international markets and it has
the capability of attracting foreign currency.
