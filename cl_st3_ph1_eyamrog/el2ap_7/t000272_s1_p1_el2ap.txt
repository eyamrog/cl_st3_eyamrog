Dental caries and periodontal disease are the most prevalent of
the biofilm-dependent diseases. With numerous side effects on the use
of chlorhexidine, the search for new safe therapeutic alternatives for
microorganisms involved with these diseases increases every day. This study
aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of extracts
made from the bark of Schinopsis brasiliensis Engl. against five
oral microorganisms and analyze their phytochemical and thermal degradation profile.
The liquid-liquid partition was performed with hexane, chloroform and ethyl
acetate. The identification and quantification of the chemical marker was
done. Antimicrobial activity was evaluated based on the minimum inhibitory
concentration. The cytotoxicity was analyzed based on the hemolysing potential
of the samples. The thermal degradation profile was performed by
two different methods. Gallic acid was identified as the main
compound of the samples and showed the highest amount in
the chloroform fraction. All samples were able to inhibit the
growth of the microorganisms tested and showed no cytotoxicity. The
ethanol extract absorbs less heat than the fractions. All samples
exhibited exothermic peak consistent with degradation of gallic acid. Based
on the results, the samples used are potential candidates for
use in dental formulations for biofilm control.
