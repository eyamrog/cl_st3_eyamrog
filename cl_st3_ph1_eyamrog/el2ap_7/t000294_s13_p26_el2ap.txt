The COVID-19 outbreak is still new and its duration uncertain.
Thus, reducing exposure to the virus is necessary to control/delay
spread of the disease and negative impacts, such as increased
mortality and degradation of the economic and social situation. Experiences
from countries that adopted measures such as social distancing and
early suspension of classes, Singapore, South Korea and Japan, point
out that immediate implementation of these measures as well as
rigorous management of cases and mass diagnoses influenced the course
of transmissibility, resulting in a lower number of deaths. Singapore,
for instance, on February 17, 2020, recorded the largest number
of confirmed cases outside mainland China. However, it immediately implemented
control measures such as isolating all suspected or confirmed cases
in rooms with negative pressure; training and re-education of health
professionals to use personal protective equipment; use of respirators and
air purifiers; monitoring of isolation teams for COVID-19 symptoms with
thermal scanners to track fever; and investment in single-use equipment
such as disposable bronchoscopes for bronchoscopy and percutaneous tracheostomy.28 And
even though there was an increase in cases in the
last week, until April 18, Singapore recorded eleven deaths and
5,992 confirmed infections.26
