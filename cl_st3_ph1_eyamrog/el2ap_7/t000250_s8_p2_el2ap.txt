Prediction models suggest that the early implementation of physical distancing
would result in averting almost 90,000 deaths in the largest
metropolitan area in Brazil3. While self- isolation measures are necessary
to reduce the infection rate4, those measures, together with the
“pandemic fear”5, 6 might be associated with a negative burden
on mental health, possibly increasing depressive and anxiety symptoms7, 8.
Therefore, strategies to mitigate the present and future impact of
this mental health burden are necessary9.
