In a coordinated initiative from the British Society of Gastroenterology
(BSG) and Crohnâ€™s and Colitis UK associa- tion, specific guidance
was provided for IBD patients according to their risk depending
on the medications in use, age, and other risk factors.
Through a decision tree, patients are stratified according to highest,
moderate, or lowest risk of serious complications from COVID-19. Patients
at the highest risk are those who either have a
comorbidity (respiratory, cardiac, hypertension, or diabetes mellitus), those over 70
years old and on any immunosuppressant therapy for IBD, those
of any age that are receiving X20 mg prednisolone, new
induction therapy with biologics and immunomodulators (combination therapy) within 6
weeks, those with moderate to severe active disease or short
gut syndrome, and patients requiring parenteral nutrition. Patients receiving biological
therapy, thiopurines, calcineurin inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, or combination therapy are
stratified as at moderate risk and the remaining IBD patients
as at the lowest risk. Patients at the highest risk
are required to self-isolate, while patients at moderate or lowest
risk should follow strict or general populace social distancing, respectively
(20).
