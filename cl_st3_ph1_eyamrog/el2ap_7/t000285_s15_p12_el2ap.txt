One author (KMM) will select the titles and abstracts of
studies for inclusion on this review. If duplicated studies are
found, only one of them will be considered for inclusion.
When reports using the same participants, but with different outcome
measurements or different assessment time points are found, both will
be considered as parts of only one study. After removing
duplicated studies, KMM will read the study titles and abstracts.
Studies that clearly do not fulfill the eligibility criteria will
be excluded and the remaining studies will then be fully
read and assessed by two authors (APR and ACPNP) for
inclusion in the review. Disagreements between authors related to this
process will be solved by a third author (KMM). The
reasons for the exclusion of studies will be described. To
optimize the process of screening and selection of studies the
Rayyan software (6) will be used.
