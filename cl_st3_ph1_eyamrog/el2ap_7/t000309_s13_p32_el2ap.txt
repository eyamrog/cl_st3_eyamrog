In Europe, from the total of eight patients, seven were
from the Porto-IBD and one adolescent (17 years) was from
the SECURE-IBD database. The majority had Crohnâ€™s disease and most
patients were in deep remission or had a moderate disease
activity index, and only one had cardiovascular disease. Almost all
patients had a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 with mild symptoms
of fever, cough, fatigue, and interestingly, none of the eight
patients had diarrhea.
