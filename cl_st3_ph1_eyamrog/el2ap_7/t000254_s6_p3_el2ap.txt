Of the 125 species identified in the area from the
shrub-tree synusia, 12 are listed in the threatened categories “Endangered”
or “Vulnerable” (Martinelli & Moraes 2013, MMA 2014, SMA 2016,
IUCN 2019). Among the Endangered, one species (Eugenia pruinosa D.Legrand,
Myrtaceae) is among the ten most abundant. In the set
of species identified, we also highlight Gonatogyne brasiliensis (Baill.) Müll.
Arg. (Phyllanthaceae), a rare species with only 52 records for
the State of São Paulo (Arzolla 2011, CRIA 2019). This
demonstrates the importance of remnants of secondary forest, like urban
forests in a recovery process, as a shelter for rare
and endangered species (Brown & Lugo 1990, Norden et al.
2009, FAO 2010). Comparing the list from this paper and
that from the Park Management Plan (SMA 2008), we observed
that 56 species identified in this study are not included
in the plan, out of which, five are listed in
some threatened category. These are important information to strengthen the
protection of forest remnants and contribute to the updating information
of the Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga.
