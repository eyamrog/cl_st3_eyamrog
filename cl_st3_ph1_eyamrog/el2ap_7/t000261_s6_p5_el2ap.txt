Water transparency was also among the variables that were most
affected by the water hyacinth removal (Bicudo et al. 2007)
and throughout the events in the time-series, and can provide
fruitful insights on the system equilibrium (Scheffer 1990). We observed
that the irreversible turbid phase may have started to reverse
since 2011, especially over the last five years (2013 to
2017) (figures 2-3). Undoubtedly, as stated by Crossetti et al.
(2019), the replacement of dense cyanobacterial blooms with other phytoplankton
species, such as the invasive Ceratium furcoides, might have contributed
to higher transparency levels.
