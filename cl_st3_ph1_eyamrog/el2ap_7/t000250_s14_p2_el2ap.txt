Participants were recruited through social media and by distributing an
invitation to participate through existing researcher networks. Brazilians adults (â‰¥18
years), currently residing in Brazil and in self-isolation due to
the COVID-19 pandemic, were eligible to participate. By self-isolation, we
mean those that decided to stay-at-home and only left for
essential activities such as food shopping, visit the pharmacist or
other health professionals. Participants were directed to an encrypted data
website (www.qualtrics.com) where they indicated their consent to participate after
reading an information sheet.
