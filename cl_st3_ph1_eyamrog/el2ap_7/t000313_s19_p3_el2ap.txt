Noteworthy, our purpose here is not to report each variation
observed in the 70 orthologues (Figure 2), but to point
out some thought-provoking findings to support the discussion and the
main conclusion of the present study. For this, we built
Figure S1, a simplified version of the data from Figure
2, where only sites and species commented in the next
paragraphs are shown.
