In this survey of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among Brazilian blood donors,
we found a seroprevalence of 3.3% (CI: 2.6-4.1) adjusted for
sensitivity and specificity of the test and weighted according to
Rio de Janeiro State population aged 18-69 years by age
group and sex. This estimate is higher than that observed
in two seroprevalence surveys among blood donors performed in Denmark
and the Netherlands (1.7% and 2.7%, respectively) [16, 17]. We
also found a substantial variation of prevalence among subgroups, with
significantly higher values among the youngest, and those with no
college education. It is worth noting that we found an
increasing linear trend in the prevalence along the three weeks
of the study (2.8%, 4.5%, and 5.3%, respectively, p<0.01), mainly
due to the increase in IgG + IgM antibodies.
