So far, there is an international consensus that patients with
IBD are not at greater risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2
than the general population, although it is uncertain whether active
inflammation increases the risk of getting SARS-CoV- 2. It is
also uncertain if IBD patients infected with SARS- CoV-2 have
a higher risk of developing COVID-19 or higher rate of
complications or mortality resulting from the disease, although data regarding
immunosuppressed patients and SARS-CoV-2 infection are very scarce (14).
