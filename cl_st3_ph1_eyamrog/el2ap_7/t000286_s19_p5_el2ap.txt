The results of the co-integration in the table 3 above
indicated that the trace statistics is greater than the critical
value at 5% level of significance in the two equations.
This shows that there is a co-integrating relationship among the
variables used to model the impact of selected macroeconomic variables
on investment inflow in Turkey for the period under study.
Specifically, they are 117.7144>69.81889 and 54.35455>47.85613. Also, the p-value is
less than 0.05 (0.0000) and (0.0109). In alternative words, the
null hypothesis of no co-integration among the variables is rejected.
Hence, the test result suggest the existence of a long-run
relationship in two co-integrating equation at 5% significance level.
