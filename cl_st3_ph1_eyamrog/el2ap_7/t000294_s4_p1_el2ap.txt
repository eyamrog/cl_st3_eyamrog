The involvement of the whole society in the conscious adoption
of preventive measures against COVID-19 requires a change in individual
and collective behavior at that moment, immediately and rigorously. In
this pandemic setting, it is possible to learn that its
course and impacts in Brazil depend on the collaborative effort
of all, government, families, and citizens. The world reality still
points to a situation of great attention and can support
choices of the path to be followed to face this
critical moment, in order to allow interference in the rapid
evolution of COVID-19.
