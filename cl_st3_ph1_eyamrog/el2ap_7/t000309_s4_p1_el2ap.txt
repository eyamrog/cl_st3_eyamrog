In the current COVID-19 pandemic, the search for safety information
and guidance is critical. IBD patients have a potentially higher
risk of complications of COVID-19 due to the chronic illness
itself, and mainly, the use of immu- nosuppressant treatments. Facing
these challenging cir- cumstances, our group has adapted IBD care
by resetting priorities, providing appropriate information for patients, and assuring
continuity of treatments. Finally, it is of para- mount importance
to remember that in developing coun- tries, a significant part
of the population lives in precarious conditions, with crowding, slum
dwelling, and lack of basic sanitation, among other unique features,
which deserve special attention from health authorities and effective adaptations.
It turns out that, in this scenario, especially in the
case of IBD patients, treatment individualization is mandatory, and the
benefits and disadvantages should always be taken into account.
