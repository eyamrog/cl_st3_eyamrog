Articles were selected in two phases. The two reviewers (VS
and DL) independently examined separately the titles and abstracts of
all references in order to eliminate obviously irrelevant studies in
phase 1. In case of difference, a consensus was decided
by the supervisor (FM). In phase 2, the full texts
were independently reviewed separately and selected accordingly. A second reviewer
(DL) performed the same process. Disagreements were also resolved by
the supervisor (FM).
