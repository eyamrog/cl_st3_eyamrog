Practical measures: Once the trocars are inserted, link the other
cable tip from connection A to one of the trocars
other than the one containing the insufflator (Figure 2B). Then,
the second cable must be used and its tip connected
to the water seal orifice B while the other tip
is connected to a slow flow continuous suction device (Figure
3). After the whole system setting is assured, the trocar
valve is opened.
