At present, Brazil has 85,380 (30/04/20) confirmed cases3 and 5,901
(30/04/20) deaths3; sub notification and sub-testing due to social distancing
and lack of testing kits compromise the data, indicating that
the published numbers do not faithfully represent Brazilâ€™s reality. In
the meantime, Rio de Janeiro (RJ) state registered 9,453 (30/04/20)
diagnosed patients3 and 854 (30/04/20) deaths3.
