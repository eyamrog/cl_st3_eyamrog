In addition to these problems, over the past decade, Turkey
has been experiencing different macroeconomic shocks, which have had a
negative effect on the country’s currency (Turkish Lira). This has
also created inflationary trends. Prevention these shocks are essential for
Turkey in order to protect itself from further macroeconomic shocks.
Consequently, Turkey has been unable to attract the expected FDI
inflows. Credit rating agencies (S&P, Moody’s and Fitch) have awarded
Turkey a poor risk score after the failed military coup
and terrorist attacks that occurred in July 2016.
