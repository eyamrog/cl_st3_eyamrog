The virus can remain viable in the air for a
prolonged period and on non-absorbent surfaces for many hours and
even days10. However, clearance of infectious particles after an aerosol
generating procedure are dependent on the mechanical/natural ventilation and air
change per hour in the room. A single air change
is estimated to remove 63% of airborne contaminants. Based on
this, the minimum time considered for cleaning the environment after
aerosol release is 20 minutes6,11.
