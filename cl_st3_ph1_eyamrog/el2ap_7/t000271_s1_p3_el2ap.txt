Results: The proportion of SARS-Cov-2 positive tests without any adjustment
was 4.0% (95% CI 3.3-4.7%), and the weighted prevalence was
3.8% (95% CI 3.1-4.5%). Further adjustment by test sensitivity and
specificity produced lower estimates, 3.6% (95% CI 2.7-4.4%) and 3.3%
(95% CI 2.6-4.1%), respectively. The variable most significantly associated with
the crude prevalence was the period of blood collection: the
later the period, the higher the prevalence. Regarding socio-demographic characteristics,
the younger the blood donors, the higher the prevalence, and
the lower the educational level, the higher the odds of
a positive SARS-Cov-2 antibody. Similar results were found for the
weighted prevalence.
