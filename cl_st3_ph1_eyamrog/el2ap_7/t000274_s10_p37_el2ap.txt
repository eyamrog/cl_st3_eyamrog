â€¢ An HME type filter (Heat and moisture exchanger) must
be placed on the tracheostome to reduce the exposure of
the virus, in case of disconnection. A suggested alternative, either
in elective and/or emergency procedures is to use an extension,
obstructed by the plunger of a syringe, and then immediately
use forceps for obstruction, followed by the removal of the
plunger and connection to the mechanical ventilation system (figure 2).
