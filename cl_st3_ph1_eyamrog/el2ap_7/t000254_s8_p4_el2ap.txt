Variations in the dynamics of plant communities can be evaluated
and monitored using permanent transects in environments with different historical
disturbances (Gomes & Mantovani 2001, Oliveira 2001). Many studies in
tropical forests have recorded the mortality and recruitment rates of
trees in order to gather information on the dynamics and
structure of these communities (Phillips & Gentry 1994, Sheil 1995a,b,
Gomes et al. 2003, Oliveira-Filho et al. 2007, Machado &
Oliveira-Filho 2010, Laurance et al. 2014). However, the majority have
been done in continuous, well-preserved forests and have focused on
trees (Gomes 1998).
