Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral respiratory illness caused
by the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) which originated from bats
(1). The 2019-nCoV is a single- stranded RNA virus and
was named by the World Health Organization (WHO) as severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) because of its similarity
to the virus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome. The infection
outbreak began in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and rapidly
spread throughout the world, including Brazil. On March 11th, 2020,
WHO declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Now more than
one million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to
the WHO, including more than 50,000 deaths. In Brazil, as
of April 4th, 2020, we have confirmed 10,278 infected patients
and 432 deaths, and the numbers continue to increase.
