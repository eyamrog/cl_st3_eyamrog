The identified individuals were classified into two successional groups: Early
and Late. This classification was based on field observations as
well as by using some papers that adapted classical concepts
(Budowski 1965, Denslow 1980, Swaine & Whitmore 1988, Whitmore 1989)
to Brazilian forests (Gandolfi et al. 1995, Ivanauskas et al.
1999, Gandolfi 2000, Paula et al. 2004, Bernacci et al.
2006, Catharino et al. 2006, Guaratini et al. 2008, Ramos
et al. 2011).
