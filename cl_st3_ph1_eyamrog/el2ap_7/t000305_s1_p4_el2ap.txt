Results: Countries without a vaccination program in place or that
never had one for BCG had incidence and mortality acceleration
rates of 21.36 and 53.21 times higher (p < 0.001),
respectively, than the same rates in countries with a universal
vaccination program. In addition, patients with an expanded vaccination program
had a 43% lower mortality rate (p < 0.001) compared
to countries with a vaccination program at birth only.
