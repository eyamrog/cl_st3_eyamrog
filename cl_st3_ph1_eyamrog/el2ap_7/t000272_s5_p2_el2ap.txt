The samples showed no cytotoxicity at the concentration tested, which
was also observed by Santos et al. (2014). According Bézivin
et al. (2003), SI indicates how many more times the
test product is effective against certain target cells than human
cells. For the compound to be considered an ideal prototype
of a new drug, it is expected that the presented
SI is greater than or equal to 10 (Protopopova et
al. 2005). According to Reimão et al. (2010), the increase
in numerical value of the SI compound indicates that it
is more toxic to microorganisms and less toxic to human
cells. Therefore, as the IS of all samples tested samples
were higher than that stated by the authors, the findings
of this research are important in the search for the
development of natural products, given that the low toxicity is
an interesting feature along with the satisfactory antimicrobial activity displayed.
