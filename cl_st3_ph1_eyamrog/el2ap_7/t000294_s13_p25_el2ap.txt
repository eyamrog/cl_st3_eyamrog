Therefore, it appears that, for instance, the estimated speed of
duplication of cases, until March 24, for Canada and the
United States (US), should occur every two and a half
days. However, on April 7, this time increased to around
seven days, showing a reduction in the speed of the
spread, although it keeps these countries on alert for the
total number of cases.27 Colombia and Brazil, in the same
interval, behaved differently, increasing the doubling time, that is, decreasing
the speed of spread of the infection, until March 29
and 30, respectively. However, until April 3, this speed was
higher for Brazil, reaching a doubling interval slightly higher than
four days, showing the need to reinforce measures to contain
the epidemic, seeking effective arrest of its advance. Until the
end of the interval, on April 18, in general the
times for doubling cases increased, showing a reduction in the
speed of infections dissemination; in Mexico, Bolivia, Peru and Brazil
the cases would be duplicated in up to 8 days,
and the other countries in figure 4 showed duplication intervals
of more than eleven days, up to eighteen days in
the case of Colombia.
