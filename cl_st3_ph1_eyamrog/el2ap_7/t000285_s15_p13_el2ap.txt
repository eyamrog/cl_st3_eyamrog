The data extraction will be conducted by two authors independently
(CRRF and FSAR). Discrepancies or disagreements on this process will
be discussed and, if necessary, solved by a third author
(VFMT). We will develop a form to extract data from
included studies, which will be used to insert data related
to: (I) Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients; (II)
Time points used for the assessments; (III) Epidemiological characteristics (IV)
Outcome measures; (V) Sources of funding; (VI) Possibility of conflict
of interests.
