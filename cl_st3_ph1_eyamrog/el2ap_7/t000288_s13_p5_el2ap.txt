Host factors can also influence susceptibility to infection and disease
progression. Research shows that SARS-CoV-2 use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
The S-glycoprotein located on the surface of the coronavirus can
bind to the ACE2 receptor on the surface of human
cells. After binding to the host cell membrane, the RNA
of the viral genome is released into the cytoplasm and
translates two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab that encode non-structural proteins
and form the replication and transcription complex (RTC) and the
replication cycle continues as stated above 18. Host antiviral defense
plays an important role in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
As the first line of defense against viruses, type I
interferon (IFN) plays a critical role in initiating host antiviral
responses. Following virus infection, the host innate immune system is
activated by the recognition of viral-specific components such as ssRNA,
dsRNA or glycoproteins.22 The Toll-like and RIG-I-like receptors are the
most common host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that respond to
RNA viruses.23 The domains then initiate an antiviral signaling cascade
by leading the phosphorylation and activation of IRF3 and NF-κB,
leading to the production of type I IFN. IFN-β secretion
induces IFN-stimulated genes, which will induce the expression of host
antiviral effector factors.24
