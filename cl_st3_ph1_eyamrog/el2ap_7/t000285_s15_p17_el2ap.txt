When at least two studies are sufficiently homogeneous in terms
of design, participants, and outcome measurements, we will assess the
possibility of pooling their results into meta-analysis. If insufficient information
or heterogeneous studies are found, the results of the studies
will be summarized only in qualitative synthesis.
