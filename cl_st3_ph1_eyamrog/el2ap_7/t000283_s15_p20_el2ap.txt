Based on pre-specified eligibility criteria, two authors will select the
studies for inclusion in the review (ACPNP and APR). When
two studies are found in more than one database (duplicated
studies) we will consider only one of them for inclusion.
If reports using the same participants and different outcome measurements
or using different time points for the assessments are found,
both reports will be included (the two reports will be
considered as parts of only one study). If duplicated reports
are found, e.g. studies with the same participants, with the
same outcome measurements and using the same time points for
the assessments, the report with the smaller sample size will
be excluded. After removing duplicate studies and reports, the authors
will read the study titles and abstracts. Studies that clearly
do not match the inclusion criteria for the review will
be excluded. The selected studies will then be fully read
under further scrutiny; the reasons for their exclusion will be
presented. Disagreements between authors regarding study inclusion will be resolved
by the third author (ANA). To optimize the process of
screening and selection of studies, we will use Rayyan application
(9).
