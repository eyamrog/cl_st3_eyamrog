Design and setting: Protocol for a rapid living systematic review,
that will follow the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews recommendations.
We will include prospective and retrospective cohort, case-control studies and
case series of patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and
Arboviral infection. We will perform the search strategy with no
language restrictions on Medline via PubMed, Embase via Elsevier, Cochrane
Library - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Portal
Regional BVS - LILACS, Scopus and WebOfScience to identify published,
ongoing, and unpublished studies. The selection and extraction will be
performed by two authors. We will perform the critical appraisal
of included studies with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the certainty
of evidence will be evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations
Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).
