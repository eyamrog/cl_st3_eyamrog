We will perform the critical appraisal of included studies with
the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (7). The quality of evidence will be
assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation
(GRADE) (8). The critical appraisal and the assessment of the
certainty of the evidence will be performed by two authors
(NCJ and VTC), and all the disagreements related to the
assessment of the critical appraisal or certainty of the evidence
will be solved through discussion and, if necessary, by mediation
from a third author (VFMT).
