We therefore believe that our data add clinical evi- dence
that allow the CT triage recommendation, as an al- ternative
indication, in resource-constrained environment for patients with suspicion for COVID-19
infections. Re- cently, a Fleishner Society statement suggested that chest
CT could be indicated for medical triage of patients with
suspected COVID-19 who present with moderate-severe clinical features and a
high pre-test probability of disease, especially when rapid point-of-care COVID-19
tests are not available(19).
