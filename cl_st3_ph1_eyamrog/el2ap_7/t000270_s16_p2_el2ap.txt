Methods - Plankton, periphyton and surface sediments material was basically
collected. Plankton samples were gathered using a cone-shaped net made
of a ± 20 µm mesh nylon fabric, that was
successively passed as many times as needed in the superficial
30 cm layer of the water bodies to gather a
macroscopically detectable amount of material at the bottom of the
flask tied to the end of the net. Samples from
levels located below the surface up to near the system
bottom, i.e. from the water column were collected using a
van Dorn sampler. Periphyton samples were gathered by collecting littoral
plant specimens, which were scrapped still in the field or
at the laboratory with a razor blade or a brush
made of marten’s hair, in order to obtain the material
more closely adhered to the substrate. Sometimes, plant specimens were
manually squeezed to get the material loosely attached to their
surface. Algae inhabiting ravines living among bryophytes or ferns were
sampled using suction pipets. Rocks, tree trunks and cement walls
were also scrapped with a spatula used to remove wall
painting to collect enough material for examination. Material inhabiting sediments
deposited at reservoir bottoms was collected with a van Dorn
sampler. Bicudo & Menezes (2017) detail all methods mentioned above.
