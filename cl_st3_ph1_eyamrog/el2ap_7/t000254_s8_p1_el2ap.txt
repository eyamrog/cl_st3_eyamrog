Human activities and climate fluctuations have been influencing the functioning
of ecosystems (Holmgren et al. 2001, O’Brien et al. 2012,
Seneviratne 2012), altering their natural regeneration and promoting unknown dynamics
in plant communities (Hubbell & Foster 1992). Forest cycles may
be shorter, communities may be more dynamic (Körner 2004, Laurance
et al. 2009) and species distributions may be changing (Hubbell
2004, Colombo & Joly 2010, Machado & Oliveira-Filho 2010, Feeley
et al. 2011). The functioning of plant communities need to
be further studied; this becomes especially important when considering the
upward trend in the frequency of environmental changes (Lavell et
al. 2012), the speed with which these changes have occurred
(Feeley et al. 2011) and their influence on the remaining
ecosystems.
