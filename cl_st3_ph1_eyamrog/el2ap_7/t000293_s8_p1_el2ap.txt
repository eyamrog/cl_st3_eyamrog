The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus (SARS- CoV-2, severe
acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavi- rus 2) has generated increasing demand
for health services and there are still many uncertainties related
to its manage- ment. The disease caused by this virus
(COVID-19, coro- navirus disease-19) is highly transmissible, but with low
lethality (1–3.5%). However, it is estimated that 15–20% of infected
people can develop severe pneumonia and 5–10% may need intensive
care. Elderly patients with comorbidi- ties are at higher risk
of death from the disease. The cur- rent gold-standard for
the etiological diagnosis of SARS- CoV-2 infection is reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on respiratory tract specimens(1,2).
