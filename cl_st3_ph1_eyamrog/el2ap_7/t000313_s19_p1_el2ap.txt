Our results reveal that the M2 model (NsSite; ω >
1) fits the placental mammal ACE2 data significantly better than
the neutral model (ω2 = 2.58680, p < 0.001; Table
S2). Considering the M2 model, 4% of the ACE2 sites
are under positive selection, a value high enough to infer
a non-neutral molecular evolution for this gene as whole, at
least considering placental mammals. Note, however, that this evolutionary scenario
is not homogeneous across the different domains of the ACE2
protein. A parallel analysis, Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB), highlights 22
sites (24, 34, 91, 93, 212, 228, 231, 251, 255,
286, 301, 387, 559, 568, 607, 653, 657, 658, 671,
675, 689, and 732) (Table S3; Figure 1) with a
high probability (> 95%) of being under positive selection, all
of them being in the active sites at the extracellular
portion of the protein (residues 18-740), where the ACE2 catalytic
domain is located. Of the remaining ACE2 sites, 69% are
under functional constraint due to the negative selection (ω0 =
0.10125), while 27% are with selective relaxation (ω1 = 1).
For instance, the signal peptide (1-17), transmembrane domain (741 -761),
and cytoplasmatic domain (761-805; see ω3 column of the Table
S4) are more conserved, showing little variation across species, none
of them with positive selection signals (Tables S2 and S4).
We note that ACE2 is a critical element in the
cascade of regulation of blood pressure and cardiovascular condition, among
other functions, and that these AA changes with a significant
signal of positive selection could be taxon-specific, related to particular
adaptive phenotypes found in some of these diverse placental mammals.
