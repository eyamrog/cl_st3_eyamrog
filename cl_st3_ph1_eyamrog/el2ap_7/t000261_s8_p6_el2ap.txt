Over these last 20 years (1997-2017), Gar√ßas Reservoir has undergone
environmental changes including management actions such as macrophytes harvesting, sewage
diversion, and construction of a secondary wastewater treatment plant in
the city zoo. Based on this comprehensive dataset, we aimed
at evaluating (1) the water quality temporal change using a
trophic state index (TSI), and (2) whether the management procedures
adopted up to now have improved the water quality. The
TSI tool has been broadly used in monitoring studies for
allowing comparison of ecosystems productivity and providing an initial approach
to determine the extent of cultural eutrophication (Carlson 1977, Salas
& Martino 1991, Lamparelli 2004, Cunha et al. 2013).
