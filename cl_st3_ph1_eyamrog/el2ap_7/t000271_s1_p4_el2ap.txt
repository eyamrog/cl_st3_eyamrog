Discussion: Although our findings resulted from a convenience sample, they
match some basic premises: the increasing trend over time, since
the epidemic curve in the state is still on the
rise; the higher prevalence among the youngest who are more
likely to circulate; and the higher prevalence among the less
educated as they have more difficulties in following the social
distancing recommendations. Despite the study limitations, it is possible to
infer that protective levels of natural herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2
are far from being reached in Rio de Janeiro. Key
