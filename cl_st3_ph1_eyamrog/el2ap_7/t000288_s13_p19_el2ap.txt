During the COVID-19 pandemic, DCHP should use telecommunication or teledentistry
prior the dental treatment to evaluate the needs of the
patient and to minimize the risk of infection, asking if
patient has fever, cough or shortness of breath (ADA)64 and
have traveled national or internationally (CDC).65,66 When possible, dentist should
offer advice, prescribe medication for analgesia and/or antimicrobial (when appropriate)
and postpone the visit of the patient to the office,
but keep direct contact with the patient by phone or
text message.67 If patient presents a dental emergency (potentially life
threatening), as an uncontrolled bleeding, or an urgent dental need
that requires relieve of severe pain and/or risk of infection,68
and present sign/symptom of respiratory infection, this patient should not
be seen in a dental office and should be referred
for an emergency care facility where Transmission-Based Precautions (N95 masks,
Airborne Infection Isolation Room for example) are available (ADA).64
