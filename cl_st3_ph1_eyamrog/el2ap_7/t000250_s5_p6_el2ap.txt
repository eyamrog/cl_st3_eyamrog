Strategies to promote MVPA practice should be adapted to this
context, in terms of both the current response to COVID-19
and the amelioration of itâ€™s future impacts on mental health.
Besides, exercise seems to reduce the severity of acute respiratory
symptoms in the general population41, however, there is yet no
study evaluating the protective effects or safety of exercise in
people with COVID-19 infection. At this moment, we suggest that
exercise professionals should be alert to the potential signs of
COVID-19 infection. Therefore, a brief screening of COVID-19 symptoms might
be necessary before engaging in MVPA42. When signs and symptoms
of infection are detected, the participant should refrain from MVPA
and follow the local health department recommendations.
