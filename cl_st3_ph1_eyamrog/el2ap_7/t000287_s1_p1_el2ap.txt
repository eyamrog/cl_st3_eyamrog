The first confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in
Brazil and Latin America was reported on February 26, 2020,
in SÃ£o Paulo. The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has placed unprecedented strain on health-care services
worldwide. Asymptomatic health-care workers (HCW) are a potential source of
SARS-CoV-2 transmission, especially to immunocompromised Oncology patients. Screening of these
HCWs may help contain transmission and isolate only those who
require it.
