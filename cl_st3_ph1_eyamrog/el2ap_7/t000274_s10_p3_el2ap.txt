Considering that the establishment of a definitive airway is directly
related to the generation of aerosol in an inevitable way,
especially when using high-speed flow, we must be aware of
the required safety measures in order to minimize the risks
of spreading the disease. Positive pressure ventilation during non-invasive ventilation
(NIV) or when using a face mask or supraglottic devices
are considered to be high risk factors for aerosol generation,
since these procedures do not offer adequate sealing, which is
inferior when compared to a definitive airway with an inflated
cuff inside the trachea.
