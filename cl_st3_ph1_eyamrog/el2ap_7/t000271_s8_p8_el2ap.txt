In the last two weeks of April 2020, we conducted
a seroprevalence survey in voluntary blood donors of Hemorio, the
main blood center in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. In
this manuscript we report the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2
based on a sample of 2,857 voluntary blood donors, adjusting
for sex and age group to supply information to health
authorities for estimates, extrapolations, and health interventions. To date, this
is the first study in Latin America addressing the SARS-CoV-2
seroprevalence in asymptomatic blood donors.
