The thermogravimetric curve (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) were
performed using a DTG-60 (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). Samples were
heated at a heating rate of 10 °C/min from 25
°C to 900 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere in an
alumina crucible containing approximately 7.0 mg of sample (Sette-de-Souza et
al., 2018).
