The success of a zoonotic spillover (transmission of a pathogen
from a vertebrate animal to a human) is a complex
process. It depends on several cultural, ecological, and climatic conditions,
as well as features of viruses and hosts (Olival et
al., 2017). The efficiency in recognizing the host binding receptor
is a crucial step, which defines the preference of the
virus for a given species, tissue or cell type. The
interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein, through its receptor- binding
domain (RBD), happens via an optimized binding to human ACE2
domains (Andersen et al., 2020; Hoffman et al., 2020; Walls
et al., 2020). According to recent studies, five amino acid
changes associated with natural selection in the critical binding sites
(L455, F486, Q493, S494, N501) located at the SARS-CoV-2 S
glycoprotein would be responsible for this high tropism with human
ACE2 (Andersen et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2020). Furthermore,
S glycoprotein of SARS- CoV-2 contains a cleavage site for
furin proteases at the junction of subunits S1 and S2
(Coutard et al., 2020). During viral infection, S glycoprotein needs
to be cleaved by host-cell proteases into S1 (which contains
RBD) and S2 subunits. After this cleavage, the exposition of
the S2 mediates fusion of the viral and host-cell membranes
(Yan et al., 2020). Furin proteases are abundant in the
respiratory tract, and this characteristic of the SARS-CoV-2 has been
considered to be essential for successful infection of SARS-CoV-2 in
human cells (Lam et al., 2020). In contrast, the highly
related bat and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-like coronavirus do not have the
furin cleavage site, which in principle could be a barrier
to zoonotic coronavirus spillover. Moreover, human-infecting coronaviruses such as HCoV-OC43,
MERS-CoV, and HKU1 also have been demonstrated to be cleaved
at an S1/S2 cleavage site by furin proteases (Coutard et
al., 2020). However, in SARS- CoV, furin-mediated cleavage of the
S glycoprotein appears not to occur naturally (Simmons et al.,
2004) and the introduction of a functional furin cleavage site
in the S1/S2 junction of SARS-CoV S glycoprotein resulted in
a dramatic enhancement of cell-cell fusion (Follis and Nunberg, 2004).
