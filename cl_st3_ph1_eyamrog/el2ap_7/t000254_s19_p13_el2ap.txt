Successional Group Dynamics - Mortality (Mdn = 9.19%) was greater
(Mann-Whitney Test, U = 18, p = 0.007) than recruitment
(Mdn = 0%) in early- successional plants with > 2.5
cm dbh during the 6.5â€‘year period, and there was no
significant difference between rates in early-successional plants with < 2.5
cm dbh. Late-successional plants with > 2.5 cm dbh did
not present significant differences (t test, t = 1.21, p
= 0.24) between mortality (= 7.67 + 1.24%) and recruitment
(= 5.53 + 1.26%), whereas those with < 2.5 cm
dbh had higher (Mann-Whitney Test, U = 16, p =
0.026) recruitment (Mdn = 20.0%) than mortality (Mdn = 7.14%)
during the same period.
