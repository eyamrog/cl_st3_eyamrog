Remdesivir is an antiviral prodrug of remdesivirtriphosphate with in vitro
activity against coronaviruses.32,33 Remdesivir-TP acts as an inhibitor of RNA-dependent
RNA polymerases and competes with adenosine-TP for incorporation into emerging
viral RNA chains.34 Hydroxyhloroquine and chloroquine have in vitro activity
against SARS-CoV-2 32,35â€“37 and the mechanism of action includes inhibition
of viral enzymes (RNA polymerase), viral protein glycosylation, virus assembly,
new virus particle transport, and virus release. Other mechanisms may
also involve ACE2 receptor inhibition, decrease acidity in endosomes, and
immunomodulation of cytokine release.5,32,36
