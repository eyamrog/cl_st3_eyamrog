Finally, to determine the content of total polyphenols, the method
described by Chandra & Mejia (2004) was used, adding Folin-Ciocalteu
1N to the aqueous extract. After 2 minutes, the aqueous
solution of 20% sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) was added, remaining there
for 10 minutes. Soon, the absorbance at 757 nm in
a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV mini - 1240) was performed. The
calibration curve was obtained from gallic acid solutions. The concentration
of polyphenols was measured in equivalent milligrams of gallic acid.
