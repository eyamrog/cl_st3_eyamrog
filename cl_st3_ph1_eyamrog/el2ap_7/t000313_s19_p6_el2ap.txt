Interestingly, the five NWm and Prossimian species show different patterns
than other primates at position 82-84. They present a moderately
conserved change at position 82 (M82T; GS = 81), which
also represents a change in polarity. We note that, due
to the great number of species that present the amino
acid Threonine in that position, according to the principle of
parsimony, Threonine is probably the ancestral allele, meaning that a
non-synonymous mutation promoted the AA alteration Threonine (T) > Methionine
(M) in the ancestral branches of the Catarrhini clade. However,
the ancestor of the Platyrrhini maintained the ancestral allele T.
At position 41, we also found the same amino acid
in NWm and Prossimian species. The moderately conservative modification Y41H
(GS = 83) represents changes in charge, once Histidine (H)
is an acid AA. Another mutation at this same site
(Y41A; GS = 112) implies a moderately radical change and
polarity difference, since Tyrosine (Y) is a polar AA, while
Alanine (A) is a non-polar AA. This type of alteration
could potentially prevent viral interaction, at least with SARS-CoV according
Li et al. (2005b). Based on the distribution of the
AAs at position 41 of ACE2, it seems that both
NWm and Prossimian clades shared the derived allele (H), also
seen in the bat genera Hipposideros and Myotis, as well
as in Equus, suggesting molecular convergence.
