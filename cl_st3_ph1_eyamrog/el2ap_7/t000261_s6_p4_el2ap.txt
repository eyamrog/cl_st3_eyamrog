The event of macrophytes removal (1999) caused a significant increase
in the TSI mean values leading to a switch to
a more turbid state, increased phosphorus concentrations, and feedback mechanisms
(Bicudo et al. 2007). This reverberated into a TSI increase
until the end of 2001 and the beginning of 2002,
as evaluated through the point break regression (figure 5). Years
after the abrupt change event, the TSI started to decrease.
This can be related to some management events in the
system history (tables 1 and 3). We highlight the importance
of secondary wastewater treatment in the city zoo (started in
October 2007). Moreover, it has most likely occurred a slowdown
in the internal P loading process since 2005, as indicated
by the lower surface P values in the time-series (figure
3) and the decrease in bottom soluble reactive phosphorus with
the increase in bottom oxygen levels (DCB, unpublished data). Therefore,
after 2007, the combination of both processes promoted the beginning
of the water quality improvement. From 2008 on, a sharp
limnological change has also been demonstrated with the replacement of
the cyanobacteria dominance from Microcystis aeruginosa (Kützing) Kützing to Cylindrospermopsis
raciborskii (Woloszýnska) Seenayya & Subba Raju (Crossetti et al. 2019).
