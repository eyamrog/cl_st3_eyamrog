Results: Participants (n=937, females=72.3%) performing ≥30 min/day MVPA or ≥15
min/day VPA had lower odds of prevalent depressive (ORMVPA=0.71, 95%CI=0.53-0.96;
ORVPA=0.60, 95%CI=0.43-0.82), anxiety (ORMVPA=0.71, 95%CI=0.54-0.96; ORVPA=0.70, 95%CI=0.51- 0.96), and co-occurring
D&A symptoms (ORMVPA=0.71, 95%CI=0.52-0.96; ORVPA=0.59, 95%CI=0.41-0.83). People spending ≥10 h/day
sedentary were more likely to have depressive symptoms (OR=1.39,95%CI=1.02-1.90). Each
hour spent in SB corresponded to 0.22 (95%CI=0.10-0.33) points and
0.16 (95%CI=0.02-0.31) points higher on the BDI and BAI, respectively.
