Analyzing Fig. 4, the fact that BCG vaccination promotes a
protective effect on the incidence and lethality of COVID-19 in
several countries was identified as a major criticism: most countries
in group 2 are temporarily behind in the course of
the pandemic. To minimize the selection bias, a time equalization
of all countries was individually performed in this study from
the start date of the pandemic, which will not be
necessary for future analyses, since the evolution of the pandemic
itself will clarify this issue (Fig. 5).
