Deflation: At the end of the procedure, the infusion of
carbon dioxide is stopped and through one of the trocars,
the intracavitary air should be aspirated to the fullest. Once
the aspiration is finished and the patient’s abdomen is flat,
the surgeon’s arm is placed under the sterile transparent plastic
bag mentioned before, which will partially cover his arm and
the entire hand.
