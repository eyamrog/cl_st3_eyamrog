The maximum height recorded in the community was 18 m
for a specimen of Aspidosperma olivaceum Müll.Arg (Apocynaceae), the median
dbh value for shrub-tree synusia was 5 cm and the
biggest dbh was 43.3 cm referring to a specimen of
Tapirira guianensis Aubl. (Anacardiaceae). The median dbh value for the
climbers was 4.6 cm and the maximum observed value was
22.3 cm. The distribution of diameters (dbh) of live plants
in 2012 did not differ from that in 2006 (Kolmogorov-Smirnov
Test, n1 = 367, n2 = 385, D = 0.05,
p = 0.81, figure 2a). The mean relative diameter growth
of the plants in the shrub-tree synusia was 1.14% year-1
(Mdn = 0.58% year‑1), the minimum growth was zero and
the maximum 9.05% year-1 in regards to a specimen of
Cryptocarya mandioccana Meisn. (Lauraceae). The diameter growth of plants with
2.5 < dbh < 5 cm (Mdn = 0.48% year-1)
did not differ from that of plants with > 5
cm dbh (Mdn = 0.7% year-1, Mann-Whitney Test, n1 =
185, n2 = 166, z = 1,549, p = 0.12,
figure 2b).
