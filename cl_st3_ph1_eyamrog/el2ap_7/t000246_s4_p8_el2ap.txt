We highlight some limits to the methodological approach in the
present research, including the use of a single research, the
difference in sensitivity of the descriptor selected for the search
of documents that appear in the title. The exclusivity of
these findings may be due to the use of only
one database. Thus, future searches may include the examination if
the extent of the co-authoring productivity pattern increases if more
articles are sampled in different databases. Despite these shortcomings, some
results of this study seem interesting and worthy of further
discussion.
