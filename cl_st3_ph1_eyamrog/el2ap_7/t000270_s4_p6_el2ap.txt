The highest species, varieties and taxonomic formae numbers identified during
this research called our attention. However, it may be explained
first because of the enormous sampling effort represented by more
than 50 years of intensive gathering. Duration of the sampling
period surely implies the identification of a higher number of
taxa. During the present survey, besides the sampling effort, obviously
also interfered with the PEFI high taxonomic richness the sampling
in the different water bodies compartments represented by the investigation
of the plankton, periphyton and the surface sediments of semilentic
systems (reservoirs). The last two compartments contributed nearly 40% to
the total number of taxa of present flora. The scenery
above undoubtedly led to the inventory of the most complete
freshwater algal flora ever carried out in Brazil.
