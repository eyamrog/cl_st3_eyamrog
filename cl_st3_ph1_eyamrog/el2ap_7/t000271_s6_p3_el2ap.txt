In this context, issues concerning if and when such suppression
measures should be lifted or strengthened have been on the
center of the debate among public health researchers and professionals,
health authorities, and the community. One of the possible indicators
for guiding such a decision is the level of herd
immunity that the population could achieve. Levels around 60% have
been considered based on the available estimates of the basic
reproduction number of the infection [22]. Since there is no
available vaccine against COVID-19, such a level of herd immunity
would have to be attained by natural infection. However, in
settings such as Rio de Janeiro, in which a forthcoming
breakdown of the health care system is soon expected, fostering
natural herd immunity is not a reasonable option since it
would require relaxing the suppression measures in course and, consequently,
increase the number of deaths by COVID-19. On the other
hand, the effectiveness and duration of suppression measures will decrease
the capacity of building herd immunity and will create difficulties
in the implementation of exit strategies and increase the possibility
of future new epidemic waves [23].
