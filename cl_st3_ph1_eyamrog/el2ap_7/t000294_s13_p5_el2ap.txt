In hospital, several antimicrobial agents have been tested against different
coronaviruses such as isopropanolol, povidone-iodine, ethanol, and sodium hypochlorite.5,14 Some
of the active ingredients, for instance, sodium hypochlorite and ethanol,
are widely available in non-medical and non-laboratory environments, which contributes
to population access.5,14 Evidence points out that surfaces that were
cleaned with 70% alcohol had an expected disinfecting effect for
two types of coronaviruses (mouse hepatitis virus and transmissible gastroenteritis
virus) after one minute of contact, compared to 0.06% of
sodium hypochlorite.19 Tests carried out with SARS-CoV showed that sodium
hypochlorite is effective at a concentration of 0.05% to 0.1%
after five minutes when it is mixed with a solution
containing SARS-CoV.5,14 A study analyzed surface stability of SARS-CoV-2, compared
to SARS-CoV-1, the closest related human coronavirus.5 The result of
the experimental study is illustrated in Chart 1.
