After two months since the identification of the first COVID-19
case in the State of Rio de Janeiro, more than
thirteen thousand confirmed cases and a thousand deaths had been
reported [3]. Despite the implementation of a wide-range of measures
aiming at restricting the social interaction of people and improving
the diagnostic capacity in the early weeks of March [20],
the epidemic curve is still on the rise with an
imminent collapse of hospital services for COVID-19 care [21].
