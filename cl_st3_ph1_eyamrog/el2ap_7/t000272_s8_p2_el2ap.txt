Dental caries is a widely prevalent disease problem globally (Bagramian
et al. 2009). It is a multifactorial and prevalent chronic
infectious resulting from tooth-adherent specific bacteria, primarily Streptococcus spp, that
metabolize sugars to produce acid, which over time, demineralizes tooth
structure (Abranches et al. 2018). Streptococcus mitis, S. oralis and
S. salivarius are associated with an initial bacteria tooth-adhesion, which
can be used as a bridge to other members of
the oral microbiota, such other streptococci and periodontopathogens (Butler et
al. 2017). Furthemore, there are reports of meningitis caused by
S. salivarius (Falomir et al. 2014, Suy et al. 2013,
Vignier et al. 2014); whereas S. oralis and S. mitis
can increase virulence factors of Candida albicans (Palma et al.
2019) and cause bloodstream infections in pediatric patients (Basaranoglu et
al. 2019). The S. mutans is the microorganism most frequently
associated with development of caries, being responsible to initiated tooth
demineralization acidifying microenvironment and tooth surface (Abranches et al. 2018;
Baker et al. 2016). Moreover, S. mutans is also associated
with bacteremia and endocarditis (Nakano et al. 2005, Nakano et
al. 2009). So, it is important to research solutions to
minimize these infections.
