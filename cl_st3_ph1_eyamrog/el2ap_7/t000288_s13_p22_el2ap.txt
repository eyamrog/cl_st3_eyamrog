Intraoral radiographs should be avoided since it can induce coughing;
the office space should be limited to the patient and
to the operator and dental assistant. After the treatment, the
DCHP should wear appropriate PPE to proceed with the cleaning
and disinfection of the room and equipment using the recommended
disinfecting products.64 Besides, dentists should reconsider the use of sedation
(inhalation and pharmacological) to manage severe anxiety or phobia in
the dental settings and focus on non-pharmacological techniques to minimize
the potential risk of needing life support measures that involve
the manipulation of airways and aerosolization (inhalation sedation).8
