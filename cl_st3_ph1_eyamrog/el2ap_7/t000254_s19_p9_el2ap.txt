Likewise, the annual recruitment of climbers in the class with
< 2.5 cm dbh was also greater than of plants
in the shrub-tree synusia (Mann-Whitney Test, U = 7.5, p
= 0.0005, figure 3). However, the annual recruitment of climbers
in the class with > 2.5 cm dbh did not
differ from the annual recruitment of shrubs and trees in
this size class (Mann-Whitney Test, U = 45, p =
0.73, figure 3).
