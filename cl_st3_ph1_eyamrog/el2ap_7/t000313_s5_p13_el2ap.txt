On the other hand, closely related species may have similar
levels of susceptibility, regardless of their distance from the pathogen's
natural host (Longdon et al., 2014). Thus, due to the
homology that ACE2 orthologues of the great apes have with
the human ACE2 regarding the 30 binding sites investigated here,
perhaps, only they are naturally and equally susceptible to develop
symptoms of COVID-19, a concern that has already been demonstrated
by members of the "Great Ape Health Consortium" (Gillespie and
Leendertz, 2020).
