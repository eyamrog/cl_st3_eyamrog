The behavior of the three limnological variables (Chl-a, TP and
SD) used to estimate TSI also demonstrated great variation during
the entire period (figure 3). Considering the whole period, TP
concentrations ranged from 37.77 to 979.68 µg L-¹ (172.44 -
mean value), Chlo-a from 11.77 to 1323.63 µg L-¹ (156.60
- mean value), and SD ranged from 0.05 to 1.7
m (0.41 - mean value) (table1). Chlorophyll-a and total phosphorus
concentrations presented similar variation, with a rapid increase of both
variables at the end of 1999. However, a distinct TP
increase occurred in 1999, 2001, at the end of 2002,
and across the years 2003 to 2005; subsequently, both variables
kept the same relative behavior. Secchi disk depth showed an
abrupt decrease during the winter of 1999 and remained with
relatively low values until 2010 when it started to increase
again (figure 3).
