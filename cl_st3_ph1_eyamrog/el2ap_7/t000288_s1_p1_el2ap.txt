The expansion of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) throughout the world
has alarmed all health professionals. Especially in dentistry, there is
a growing concern due to it’s high virulence and routes
of transmission through saliva aerosols. The virus keeps viable on
air for at least 3 hours and on plastic and
stainless-steel surfaces up to 72 hours. In this sense, dental
offices, both in the public and private sectors, are high-risk
settings of cross infection among patients, dentists and health professionals
in the clinical environment (including hospital’s intensive dental care facilities).
This manuscript aims to compile current available evidence on prevention
strategies for dental professionals. Besides, we briefly describe promising treatment
strategies recognized until this moment. The purpose is to clarify
dental practitioners about the virus history and microbiology, besides guiding
on how to proceed during emergency consultations based on international
documents. Dentists should consider that a substantial number of individuals
(including children) who do not show any signs and symptoms
of COVID-19 may be infected and can disseminate the virus.
Currently, there is no effective treatment and fast diagnosis is
still a challenge. All elective dental treatments and non-essential procedures
should be postponed, keeping only urgent and emergency visits to
the dental office. The use of teledentistry (phone calls, text
messages) is a very promising tool to keep contact with
the patient without being at risk of infection.
