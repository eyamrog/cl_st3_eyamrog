When more in vitro and in vivo functional studies are
performed, we will know what is the minimum AA combination
in the ACE2 binding sites and in other critical regions
of the receptor that is indispensable for an active connection
with SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein. Until then, the predictions are speculative,
but they can bring subsidies for future studies and strategies
to contain the infection and its harmful consequences. Here, we
suggest that there are not many ACE2 orthologues with tropism
for SARS-CoV-2, precisely because of its ability, shaped by natural
selection, to use Homo sapiens ACE2 as an efficient and
successful gateway to the host-cell. To our knowledge, there is
only one preliminary in vivo study to test the susceptibility
of animals to SARS- CoV-2 (Shi et al., 2020). These
authors intra-nasally inoculated ferrets, cats, dogs, pigs, chickens, and ducks
with a dosage of SARS-CoV-2, and euthanized them some days
post inoculation. They reported that ferrets and cats are highly
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, dogs have low susceptibility, and livestock including
pigs, chickens, and ducks are not susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2.
On the other hand, there are no scientific record up
to date of natural infection by SARS-CoV-2 in animals living
in anthropogenic environments (only rare press reports that described that
cats, as well as tigers and lions from the Bronx
Zoo in New York City were infected), an observation that
challenges previous predictions that this coronavirus would infect a wide
range of species (Luan et al., 2020; Wan et al.,
2020). The absence of a veterinary epidemiological emergency during the
current human COVID-19 pandemic, at least considering pets, also challenges
the Shi et al.Â´s preliminary results, which indicated a high
susceptibility of cats to SARS-CoV-2 (Shi et al., 2020). If
there is such a susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection to these
and other animals, it appears that it is much more
restricted than that observed for humans.
