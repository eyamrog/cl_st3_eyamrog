The TG curve of the hexane fraction is the only
one that shows two degradation phenomena. The first occurs between
29.78 to 201.52 °C, which can be related to water
loss and residual solvent fraction, equivalent to 9.72% of its
total mass. The second from 201.53 to 479.82 °C, has
a mass loss of 81.97%, corresponding to 5.80 mg of
the fraction, practically degrading almost all the present compounds.
