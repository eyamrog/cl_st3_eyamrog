In this study, Fabaceae, which is characteristic of environments at
earlier successional stages and seasonal forests, was not among the
first three richest and most abundant families. This result differed
from what has been shown in other previous studies done
in the park (Struffaldi-De-Vuono 1985, Nastri et al. 1992, Gomes
& Mantovani 2001, Pivello & Peccinini 2002, Eisenlohr et al.
2009, Hirata et al. 2010, Tanus et al. 2012). Similarly,
the family Euphorbiaceae was not among the most represented families.
The study area is in a more mature successional stage,
with low abundance and richness of early-successional species such as
those of the genus Machaerium (Fabaceae) and Alchornea (Euphorbiaceae) which
are common in less mature areas of the park. The
highest recruitment and predominance of late-successional species and higher mortality
in the early-successional group in the area, seem to point
to the progression of forest regeneration, the same results obtained
in an area (Gomes et al. 2003) and different from
other areas of the park (Struffaldi-De-Vuono 1985, Knobel 1995).
