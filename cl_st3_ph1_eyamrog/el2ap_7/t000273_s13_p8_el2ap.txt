Established in 2011 by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, the
Telehealth program (Programa Telessa√∫de, in Portuguese) has been an additional
tool used by health professionals and managers to combat COVID-19.
By means of bidirectional telecommunication instruments, health professionals and managers
can send their doubts about clinical management, preventive actions or
even issues related to the work process; and a qualified
professional sends the requesting professional information based on the current
scientific evidence.11 This has allowed to qualify the care provided
in the PHC and to reduce unnecessary referrals of users
to more specialized levels.
