On the other hand, the differences in these 30 important
ACE2 binding sites of interaction with SARS-CoV-like viruses observed between
species and taxonomic groups is striking, probably impacting SARS-Cov-2's ability
to bind with ACE2 in some of these species. SARS-CoV-2
capacity to infect other 42 mammalian species was recently predicted
based on changes at positions 31, 35, 38, 82, and
353 in the ACE2 orthologues when compared with the human
ACE2 (Luan et al., 2020). These authors suggested that 76%
of the 42 mammal species investigated, including pets (dog, Canis
lupus familiaris, and cat, Felis catus), horse (Equus caballus), cattle
(Bos taurus), and sheep (Ovis aries), may bind to S
protein of SARS-CoV-2. The idea of a “generalist’ coronavirus, capable
of infecting other species of mammals (pig, ferret, cat, orangutan,
monkey) had also been argued by other authors, despite of
the differences in their correspondent ACE2 orthologues (Wan et al.,
2020).
