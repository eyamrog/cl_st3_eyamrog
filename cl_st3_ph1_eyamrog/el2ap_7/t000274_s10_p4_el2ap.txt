Laryngoscopy, tracheal intubation and bronchoscopy will promote aerosol production only
if there is a cough stimulus or if other procedures
that can generate aerosol are performed (e.g. aspiration). Many of
these events that can precipitate aerosol production can be prevented
by adequate neuromuscular block and avoiding simultaneously different procedures.
