To use respirators or mask N95 or PFF2, it must
be considered that the equipment must be properly adjusted to
the face. How they are uses, handled and stored must
follow the manufacturerâ€™s recommendations, also the accessory must never be
shared among professionals. The following checks of the components must
be made before use, including strips and material of the
nasal bridge, to ensure its fit and sealing: visually inspect
the N95 mask to determine if its integrity has been
compromised (damp, dirty, torn, dented or creased masks cannot be
used). It is also important to note that the surgical
mask should not be superimposed on the N95 mask or
equivalent, as, in addition to not guaranteeing protection from filtration
or contamination, it can also lead to the waste of
another Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), which can be very damaging
in this pandemic setting.23 Another relevant aspect is that exceptionally,
in situations of lack of supplies and to meet the
demand of the COVID-19 epidemic, the N95 mask or equivalent
can be reused by the same professional, provided that mandatory
steps are taken to remove the mask without contamination. inside.
To minimize the contamination of the N95 mask or equivalent,
if available, a face shield can be used. Also, if
the mask is intact, clean and dry, it can be
used several times during the same shift by the same
professional (up to 12 hours or as defined by the
Hospital Infection Control Commission - HICC - of the health
service).23
