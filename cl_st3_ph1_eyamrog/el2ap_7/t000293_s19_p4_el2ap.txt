In the first scenario, considering only chest CT with typical
findings as positive, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy
were respectively 64.0%, 84.8%, 61.5%, 86.2% and 79.1% (Table 1).
In the second scenario, con- sidering chest CT with typical
or indeterminate findings as positive, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV
and ac- curacy were respectively 92.0%, 62.1%, 47.9%, 95.3% and
70.3% (Table 2). The sensitivity of chest CT was higher
in the second scenario (92.0% vs. 64.0%; p = 0.016)
and the specificity was higher in the first scenario (84.8%
vs. 62.1%; p < 0.001).
