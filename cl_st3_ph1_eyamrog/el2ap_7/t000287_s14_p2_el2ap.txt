symp- tomatic positive IgM results and/or positive RT-PCR were quarantined
immedi- ately for 14 days; (2) HCW with negative serology
and no symptoms were in- structed to maintain protective measures
and personal protection equipment (PPE); (3) HCW with indeterminate IgM
results were re-tested after one week accompanied by an infectious
diseases physicianâ€™s guidance.
