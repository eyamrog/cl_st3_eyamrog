Figure 5 presents a synthesis of the TSI inter- annual
variation. As we can see, the trophic state index of
2017 is very similar to the trophic state of 1997
(very close to the hypereutrophic threshold). In contrast, along the
2000-2010 period, TSI increases and the hypereutrophic state predominates. Starting
in 2011 (except for 2013), TSI decreases to the supereutrophic
state. The highest change in TSI occurred after phase II
(April/1998-Sep./1999); thereafter, more pronounced changes occurred along different events reported
during the study (table 1 and table 3). In particular,
we observed the strong influence of the zoo secondary sewage
treatment (STS Zoo in figure 5) as revealed in a
gradual decrease in all of the values of the variables
(table 1). Over the last period (2014-2017), we observed the
lowest values of TSI, chlorophyll-a, and total phosphorus concentrations (table
1) in the time-series.
