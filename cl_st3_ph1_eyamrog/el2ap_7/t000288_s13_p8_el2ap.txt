Based on the current epidemiological investigation, the incubation period is
from 1 to 14 days, mainly from 3 to 7
days, being contagious in its latency period. It is highly
transmissible in humans, especially in the elderly and people with
underlying diseases. Patients with COVID-19 have symptoms such as fever,
malaise and cough. Most adults or children infected with SARS-CoV-2
have mild flu-like symptoms. However, a few patients also progress
to a critical condition and rapidly develop acute respiratory distress
syndrome, respiratory failure, multiple organ failure and even die.18,30 There
are still many gaps in knowledge about the epidemiology and
clinical overview of COVID-19, including the exact incubation period, the
possibility of transmission from asymptomatic carriers and the rate of
transmissibility. However, human-human transmission has been rapidly proven and remains
responsible for the continued spread of the disease.
