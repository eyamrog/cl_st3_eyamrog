The association of the descriptor “pacifier” was performed with the
other terms and, initially, 121 articles were obtained from all
databases. After excluding duplicate studies, 56 were selected for reading,
as they had at least one of the defined keywords
in their title or abstract. The respective documents were submitted
to an initial screening considering the following aspects: summary, disinfection
methods used and the relevance of the results, which resulted
in 11 studies obtained. The selected documents underwent a final
screening through the complete reading in order to verify if
they met the inclusion and exclusion criteria, resulting in 8
articles. Figure 1 shows a flowchart describing the process of
identification, selection, eligibility of studies and inclusion.
