It was observed in the DTA curve that the EE
absorbs less heat than the fractions. All samples show an
endothermic peak in the range of 85.0 to 130.0 째C,
consistent with the humidity loss, water and/or volatile solvent used
in each system. The TG curve of the EE has
three thermal decomposition events. The first, which is set in
the range of 30.00 to 86.96 째C is related to
loss of water and solvent from the extract, as mass
loss was approximately 4.55% of the total sample. The second
event (87.01 to 205.75 째C) may be associated with the
degradation of phytochemical compounds found in the sample, such as
tannins and flavonoids, with an equivalent mass loss at 21.54%
(1.33 mg). The third event (from 205.85 째C) could be
related to degradation of gallic acid present in the sample,
considering that this temperature coincides with the second step where
the degradation of phenol lost reaches 51.33% of total sample
mass (3.17 mg). The fraction chloroform curve is very similar
to the EE and is even the sample with the
closest profile to the EE, in respect to both thermal
decomposition peaks and mass percentage lost in each step.
