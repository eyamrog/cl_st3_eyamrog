When the dynamics of both successional plant groups with dbh
< 2.5 cm were compared, no significant differences were found
between the annual mortality rates of successional groups (Mann-Whitney Test,
U = 31, p = 0.16). However, annual recruitment rate
of late-successional plants was higher than that of early-successional plants
(U = 11.5, p = 0.003, figure 5).
