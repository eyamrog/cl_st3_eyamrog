Data analysis - We used an adaptation of Carlsonâ€™s Trophic
State Index (TSI) (Carlson 1977) proposed by Lamparelli (2004) for
tropical reservoirs - an index elaborated from reservoirs located at
the same area of our study (CETESB 2014). TSI uses
the total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) content, and Secchi disk
depth (SD) data to calculate the corresponding trophic index. This
procedure resulted in a 20-year trophic state time-series data.
