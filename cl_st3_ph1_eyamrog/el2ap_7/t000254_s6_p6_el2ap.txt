The short stature of canopy trees in mountain tropical forests
is also due to high turnover (Herwitz & Young 1994).
As expected and shown in other studies (Condit et al.
1996b, Machado & Oliveira- Filho 2010, Feeley et al. 2011,
Laurance et al. 2014), the smallest plants were the most
dynamic, with the largest recruitment. However, the larger ones also
had the highest mortality rates, as observed in another area
of the park (Gomes et al. 2003). The highest mortality
rates, quantified in the extreme size classes (< 2.5 cm
and > 5 cm dbh), may reflect the fragility of
small plants (Salles & Schiavini 2007), more prone to lethal
damage (Sheil et al. 2000), and of larger trees, as
senescent pioneers, in competition with other plants in the community
(Felfili 1995, Schorn & Galv√£o 2009). However, late-successional plants predominate
the community, and even though early-successional plants show an evident
decline, it is not correct to state that overall mortality
is due only to the death of this plants, given
that the death of late-successional plants also represented a considerable
percentage of deaths during the study period.
