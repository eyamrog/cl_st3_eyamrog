Otherwise, the results of our study should be considered with
caution. Although varied in demographic and social terms, the population
studied is a convenience sample, and any extrapolation for the
whole population of the State of Rio de Janeiro, even
only for those aged 18-69 years, might be biased. The
study population was also not selected to give estimates for
different regions of the State, but the prevalence of infection
is expected to show huge variation across geographical areas of
the city.
