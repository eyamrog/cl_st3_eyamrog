All extracts tested had higher MIC values on the bacteria
tested than the positive control (0.12% chlorhexidine). According to Castro
et al. (2009), this can be explained by the fact
that the natural products contain biological compounds diluted in the
sample while chlorhexidine is a synthetic drug. However, it is
important to note that chlorhexidine has adverse effects that limit
its period of use. In a systematic review, Haas et
al. (2014), showed that chlorhexidine showed good results in reducing
biofilm and gingivitis, however, it must be used for short
treatments due to its adverse effects, and the natural agent
based products are more suitable for everyday use. Therefore, the
hexane fraction of the EE of S. brasiliensis Engl is
a potential agent that could be incorporated into preventive and
therapeutic products in dentistry, due to its activity against Streptococcus
mitis and S. oralis, which are responsible for the initial
colonization of the tooth surface, and against S. mutans, which
is primarily responsible for the initiation / progression of dental
caries and other diseases. Moreover, Duarte et al. (2006) have
reported the activity of phenolic compounds against S. mutans biofilm
and therefore, a further justification for the use of the
extract in this area.
