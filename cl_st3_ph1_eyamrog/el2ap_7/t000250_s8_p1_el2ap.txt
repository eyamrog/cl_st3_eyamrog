The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global public health
emergency. Up to the 13th of May, over 4 million
cases and 280 thousand deaths worldwide were reported1. In Brazil,
to that date, over 160 thousand cases and 11 thousand
deaths have been notified1. To decrease the spread of the
SARS-CoV-2 virus, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the adoption
of physical distancing measures by national governments1. In Brazil, the
epidemiological report number 05 of the Ministry of Health has
proposed social distancing measures, including self-isolation for areas with community
transmission2. Self- isolation measures are deemed to limit the circulation
of the individual in society, thus limiting contact with other
individuals. During self-isolation in Brazil, there is a “stay at
home” recommendation, asking people going out in public only for
essential activities, such as going to the supermarkets or pharmacies
or to use essential services for subsistence, such as medical
assistance. Yet the national recommendation is to stay at home,
each one of the 27 federative units of Brazil can
decide about the adoption and implementation of more restrictive measures
(quarantine/lockdown).
