The TG curve of ethyl acetate fraction also shows three
different stages of thermal decomposition. The first is between 29.35
to 225.23 °C, similar to that found in EE. However,
besides the loss of moisture and residual solvent fraction, there
is probably some loss of another compound, as this loss
was equivalent to 16.97% of the total (1,13mg). The second
event, which happened between 225.30 and 327.87 °C, may be
related to the degradation of flavonoids found in the sample,
as well as the degradation of gallic acid present, equivalent
to 26.42% of mass loss (1.76 mg), since the peak
gallic acid degradation occurs at about 263 ºC in an
exothermic event. Finally, the degradation starts at 328.00 ºC and
possibly the degradation of carbonaceous residues comes at the penultimate
stage, which does not reach complete degradation (46.23% mass loss).
