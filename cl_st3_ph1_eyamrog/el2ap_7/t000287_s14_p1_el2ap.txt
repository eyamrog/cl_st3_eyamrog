Between 09 and 29 April of 2020, 60 HCWs of
CTO were tested for COVID-19; this number represents the total
number of employees at the clinic. All HCW were tested
through IgM/IgG rapid testing by near-patient lateral flow devices, while
nasopharyngeal swabs and real-time polymerase-chain-reaction (RT- PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 were
added as a secondary investigational method amongst symptomatic HCWs (e.g.,
fever, cough, shortness of breath, or sore throat).
