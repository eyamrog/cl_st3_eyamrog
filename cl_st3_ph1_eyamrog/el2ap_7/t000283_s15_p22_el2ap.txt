We will perform critical appraisal of included studies with Risk
of Bias tool (10) as recommended by Cochrane Collaboration. We
will evaluate the certainty of evidence using the Grading of
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) (11). GRADE judgement is
based on the overall risk of bias, consistency of the
results, directness of the evidence, publication bias and precision of
the results for each outcome. The GRADE profiler software, available
online, will be used to summarize our findings on the
certainty of evidence (12). Assessment of risk of bias (ACPNP
and KMMM), and assessment of the certainty of evidence (VTC
and NCJ) will be performed by two review authors. All
the disagreements in the assessment of the risk of bias
or the certainty of evidence will be solved through discussion
or, if required, by consulting with a third author (ANA).
