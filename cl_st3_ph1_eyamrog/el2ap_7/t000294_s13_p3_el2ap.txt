For this reason, one of the most important measures for
preventing transmission refers to hand hygiene, considered a low-cost and
high-effectiveness measure, since hands are the main vehicle of cross-contamination.
Countless studies point to inadequate adoption of this practice among
professionals during care for patients in health services.5,11-13 Admittedly, the
practice of hand hygiene by rubbing with water and soap
reduces the occurrence of preventable infections, reducing morbidity and mortality
in health services.14-18 However, the complexity involved in complying with
this measure is great, and can often be related to
factors such as human behavior, including false perceptions of an
invisible risk, underestimation of individual responsibility and lack of knowledge,
behaviors that can interfere with compliance with preventive measures.16-18 People
have emphasized compliance with this measure and its importance, but,
in addition to the difficulties mentioned, some barriers that should
not exist are still part of institutional realities, such as
lack of sinks and supplies such as soap and water
or even paper in public places that are characterized by
high handling and contact of people, transit of escalators, toilets,
buses, subways etc., as well as in communities without regular
water and sewage supply.
