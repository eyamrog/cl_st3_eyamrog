In Brazil, the Unified Health System (SUS), established in the
1980s for universal and whole care, has the fundamental mission
of guaranteeing care for more than 210 million Brazilians and
thousands of foreigners residing or passing through the country.3 In
face of COVID-19, SUS assumes a fundamental role in the
containment of the disease in Brazil, using a wide network
of hospitals, laboratories, research centers, health units, blood bank and
blood products, private network linked to institutions support, and public
universities.
