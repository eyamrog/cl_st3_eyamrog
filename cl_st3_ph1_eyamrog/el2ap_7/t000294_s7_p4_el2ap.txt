In Brazil, on February 3, 2020, it was declared, through
Ordinance 188 from the Ministry of Health, a public health
emergency of national importance, corresponding to a risk classification at
level 3, due to human infection with the new coronavirus
(SARS-CoV-2). This action aimed to favor that administrative measures were
taken with greater agility so that the country began to
prepare itself to face the pandemic, although at the time
there was still no record of a confirmed case.9 The
first case of infection in Brazil was notified by the
Ministry of Health on February 26, in the city of
SÃ£o Paulo, and the entire country from that moment on
went on alert. Hand hygiene measures and cough etiquette were
reinforced.10 However, the advance of the disease has been rapid,
evolving in less than thirty days of cases imported for
community or sustainable transmission. Imported cases are those in which
it is possible to identify the origin of the virus,
in general, when a person acquires it on trips abroad,
at first, coming from countries like China and Italy.10 In
community transmission, the origin of the disease can no longer
be identified, in addition to asymptomatic cases that come to
represent a greater risk, considering that they spread the virus
effectively.10 In this new context of transmission at the national
level, we witnessed, in parallel, estimates based on mathematical models
proposed by researchers, and progression of COVID-19 cases in countries
whose entry of the virus occurred in the period prior
to notification in Brazil.
