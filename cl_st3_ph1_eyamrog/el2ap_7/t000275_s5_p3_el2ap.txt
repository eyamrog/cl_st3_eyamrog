Shaoqing et al.12 recently described a group of 34 patients
who needed hospital treatment due to severe COVID-19 symptoms that
were only present after they had undergone surgery. In the
study, asymptomatic patients, with no sign or symptoms of any
previous viral infection, residing in Wuhan, underwent surgery. All had
post-operative pneumonia. These findings suggest the procedure may have accelerated
and exacerbated the COVID-19 disease progression.
