While there are data suggesting that chemotherapy-treated patients with cancer
are at risk for severe complications of influenza4,5, it is
unclear how this might apply to COVID-19. A recent study
has reported increased incidence and mor- bidity of COVID-19 in
patients with cancer6, but those findings were directly challenged by
others7. Preliminary data by Zhang et al have shown a
relatively high mortality of 8 of 28 (29%) hospitalized patients
with COVID-19 who were previously diagnosed with cancer8.
