This recent COVID-19 turned into a global public health outbreak.
It is transmitted after contact with infected surfaces and with
infected patientâ€™s fluids, including saliva and aerosol. A substantial number
of individuals do not show any signs and symptoms and
may disseminate the virus. These characteristics put the dental offices
as main risk settings of cross infection among patients and
dentists. Currently there is no effective treatment and fast diagnosis
is still a challenge. All elective dental treatments and non-essential
procedures should be postponed, keeping only urgent and emergency visits
to the dental office. Unexpected situations like this pandemic, brings
financial issues to the dental team; in this way, financial
education become very important subject to be discussed during the
professional school. The use of telecommunication (phone calls, text messages)
and teledentistry are very promising tools to keep contact with
the patient without put them in high risk of infection.
