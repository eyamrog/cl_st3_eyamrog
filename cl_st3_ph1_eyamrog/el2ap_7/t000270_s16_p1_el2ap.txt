Study area - Area of present study is the PEFI,
Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga (Ipiranga sources State Park)
located in the southeast region of the Municipality São Paulo
between parallels 23°38'08''S and 23°40'18''S and meridians 43°36'48''W and 43°36'00''W.
PEFI includes the extension of 526.30 ha, and the 24
sources of the Ipiranga Creek, that supply nine reservoirs locally
called lakes. Emphasis should be put, because of their size,
on the Garças, Cisnes, Ninfeias and IAG reservoirs. For more
details concerning the Garças, Ninfeias and IAG reservoirs, please check
