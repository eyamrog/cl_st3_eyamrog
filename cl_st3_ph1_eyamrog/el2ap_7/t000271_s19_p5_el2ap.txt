In the logistic regression analyses (Table 2), some of the
covariates were significantly associated with the crude SARS-Cov-2 antibody prevalence.
The variable most significantly associated to the crude prevalence was
the period of blood collection: the later the period, the
higher the prevalence. The odds of a positive SARS-Cov-2 antibody
in the third period was 2 times greater than in
the first period (OR=2.05; 95% CI 1.33- 3.16). Regarding socio-demographic
characteristics, the younger the blood donors the higher the prevalence;
furthermore, the lower the educational level the higher the odds
of a positive SARS-Cov-2 antibody. No statistically significant difference was
found for sex nor for municipality of residence (capital or
elsewhere). The site of the blood collection also showed a
significant association with the crude prevalence: the blood donors from
condominiums show a significantly lower prevalence when compared to blood
donors from Hemorio.
