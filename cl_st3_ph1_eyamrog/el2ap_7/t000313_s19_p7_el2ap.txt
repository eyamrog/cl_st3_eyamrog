NWm ACE2 is also different from other Primates species due
to two changes in the potential glycosylation sites at positions
432 and 546 (Luan et al., 2020), where Arginine (N)
was replaced by Serine (S). The glycosylation was suggested by
the presence of electron density at all Arginine- linked site
of the ACE2 N-terminal domain, including 432 and 546 and
the loss of glycosylation sites may have functional implications (Towler
et al., 2004). Studies with MERS-CoV and with its host-cell
entry receptor, DPP4, indicated that mutations that knock out glycosylation
sites present in mouse DPP4 blocked the binding with MERS-CoV
RBD (Peck et al., 2017). The last authors concluded that
glycosylation in DPP4 orthologue sites are a substantial barrier to
MERS-CoV infection, particularly when combined with taxon-specific changes (Peck et
al., 2017).
