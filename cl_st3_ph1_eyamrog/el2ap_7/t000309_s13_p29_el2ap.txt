IBD in children often presents with more extensive and severe
disease than adults. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 infection with digestive symptoms is
of particular concern in pediatric IBD (PIBD) patients. As of
April 3rd, 2020, eleven children (younger than 19 years) have
been reported to have SARS- CoV-2 infection by SECURE-IBD from
a total of 275 patients. No cases were from Brazil.
Only one patient was younger than 9 years; all cases
were outpatients and no deaths were reported. Some questions arose:
are PIBD patients at increa- sed risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection?
Is the infection in PIBD more severe than in adults?
Should treatment be delayed or discontinued during the infection?
