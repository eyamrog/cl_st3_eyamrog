The quantitative determination of phytochemical extract and fractions of S.
brasiliensis Engl. detected the presence of large quantities of polyphenols.
Based on this result gallic acid was chosen as a
marker and we proceeded to quantify the samples. In all
samples analyzed a predominant presence of gallic acid is observed,
which has a close retention time of 3.0 minutes (Figure
1).
