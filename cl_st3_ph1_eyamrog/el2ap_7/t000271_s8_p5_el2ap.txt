Knowing the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic people is necessary
for two major reasons. First, healthy people in epidemic areas
may be infected and show no symptoms but might be
significant sources of transmission. Indeed, at the beginning of the
epidemic in China, about 86% of infections were not detected,
but they were the source of infection for about 79%
of cases [8]. Second, herd immunity is an essential indicator
of the spread of the infection in a community. Monitoring
the level of herd immunity might be important as a
reference for guiding the future decisions on when would be
safe to start relaxing social distancing recommendation, minimizing the possibility
of subsequent epidemic outbreaks [12].
