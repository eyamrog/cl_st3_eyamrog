Operating room setup: Currently, the use of personal protective equipment
is mandatory in any procedure performed due to the COVID-199.
All healthcare professionals involved in surgical procedure must wear hats,
goggles, gloves, N95 masks, face shields, along with the usual
sterile garments for the surgical team. Ideally, rooms with negative
pressure should be the rule. The induction and definitive airway
procedure should be performed in the absence of the complete
surgical team, only carried out by an anesthesiologist and an
assisting nurse, guaranteeing as few professionals as possible inside the
operating room. Once the airway is secured and the ventilatory
system is connected, the remaining surgical team may enter the
theater for patient positioning, table setting and any procedures required
for the operation.
