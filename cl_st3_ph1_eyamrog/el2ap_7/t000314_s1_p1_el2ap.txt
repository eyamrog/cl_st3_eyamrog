This paper shows a technique for the detection of regularities
in the complete genome of Coronavirus 2. For this, the
concept of intervals in the RNA chain and their comparison
within the known sequence is used. The Maximum Regularity Index
was applied. The results show that areas of high regularity
are identified that coincide with ORF10, Gene N, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein
and others. The interval around 3500 and the interval around
11000, respectively, appear with high values of regularity and this
do not correspond to particularly documented elements (both within Gene:
Orf1ab). It might be in the interest of giving importance
to that region. The detection of regularities can enhance the
creation of biochemical or genetic techniques to deactivate certain functions
of Coronavirus 2 or control its effects.
