Plankton material (423) represents the largest number of samples, followed
by periphyton (294), benthos (54), and the surface sediments (28).
A sampling of soil material, epiphyton, tree trunks, and epilithon
was also carried out in a smaller, but appropriate scale.
It is very important to comment that gathering of periphytic
material contributed to the knowledge with approximately 40% of total
PEFI’s inventoried taxa, which would not be inventoried if only
plankton material was collected. Another kind of sample that contributed
significantly to the survey of the PEFI algal flora, mostly
of the diatoms and non-pigmented euglenoids, was that of reservoirs’
surface sediments.
