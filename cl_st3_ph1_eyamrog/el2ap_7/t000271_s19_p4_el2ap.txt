Table 1 shows four prevalence estimates. The proportion of SARS-Cov-2
positive tests without any adjustment (crude prevalence) was 4.0% (95%
CI 3.3-4.7%). The weighted prevalence by the Rio de Janeiro
State population was slightly lower (3.8%; 95% CI 3.1-4.5%). Further
adjustment by the test sensitivity and specificity produced even lower
estimates when compared to the crude prevalence: 3.6% (95% CI
2.7-4.4%) for the non-weighted prevalence and 3.3 (95% CI 2.6-4.1%)
for the weighted prevalence.
