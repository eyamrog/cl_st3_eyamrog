Significant differences between rates were assessed using the Student’s t-test
for normally distributed data (means and standard error were presented)
or the Mann-Whitney test (medians = Mdn were presented). One-way
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc test of Tukey -
Kramer were used to compare the three tree and shrub
size classes. The assumptions were checked with the Shapiro-Wilk tests
and Q-Q plot for normal distribution and Levene’s test for
homogeneity of variance. The degree of spatial dependence of the
values was quantified by analysis of correlations according to Legendre
& Fortin (1989), with later adjustment (decrease of two degrees
of freedom). Mortality (Mr) and recruitment (Rr) rates were calculated
algebraically and not logarithmically, as recommended by Sheil and colleagues
(1995):
