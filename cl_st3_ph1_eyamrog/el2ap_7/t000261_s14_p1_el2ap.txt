Study Area - Garças Reservoir (23°38'40.6"S, 46°37'28.0"W) is a shallow
tropical system located in the Parque Estadual das Fontes do
Ipiranga - a protected area of the Atlantic Rain Forest
within the city of São Paulo, São Paulo State, southeastern
Brazil (figure 1). It was formed from a larger water
supply reservoir (Campanário Reservoir) by damming the Campanário creek to
meet the increasing demand for drinking water in 1894. Starting
in ~1917, Campanário Reservoir was divided into five smaller water
bodies, having the Garças Reservoir remained as the main system.
The eutrophication process began with untreated sewage loadings from the
city zoo (1958) and additional untreated sewage input from the
São Paulo State Department of Agriculture (1975) (Costa-Böddeker et al.
2012). A drastic increase in allochthonous nutrients (N, P) led
to the highest macrophyte proliferation, with plants occupying 40-70% of
the water surface causing mosquitoes proliferation in the reserve. Local
authorities ordered the mechanical removal of all the macrophyte cover,
which was later on carried out within two months (September/1999),
triggering an abrupt change of Garças Reservoir from eutrophic to
hypereutrophic state with permanent cyanobacteria blooms (Bicudo et al. 2007).
In 2014, it occurred the invasion of Ceratium furcoides due
to disturbing events sufficient to break the continuous dominance of
cyanobacteria blooms (Crossetti et al. 2019). Further information on climate,
morphometric features and limnological changes in the reservoir are available
in Bicudo et al. (2007) and Crossetti et al. (2019).
