Regarding mortality, groups 1 and 5.1 have the highest values,
11.586 and 9.925 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively. Group 4
is the one that presents the lowest mortality, 0.209 deaths
per 100,000 inhabitants, and here the fact that China is
included may reflect this result due to its large number
of inhabitants, but group 3 (countries with an expanded vaccine
scheme) is the one with the lowest lethality rate, with
1.87 deaths per 100 cases (p < 0.001).
