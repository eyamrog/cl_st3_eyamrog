Freshwater systems are among the most threatened ecosystems worldwide despite
being essential natural resources (Dudgeon at al. 2006, Vörösmarty et
al. 2010, Moss 2010). Among the anthropogenic impacts, eutrophication is
a widespread problem impairing the water multiple uses, maintenance of
aquatic biodiversity, and human health (Davidson & Jeppesen 2013, Cumming
et al. 2015).
