In case of possible significant heterogeneity or inconsistency, we will
use subgroup analysis. We will explore, when possible, the following
available variables: age, sex, comorbidities, strategy to address pandemic threat
(e.g. quarantine, lockdown, social distance) and disease severity. We will
also perform sensitivity analysis for include studies with high risk
of bias, missing data.
