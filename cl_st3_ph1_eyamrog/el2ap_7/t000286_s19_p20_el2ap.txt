The results revealed that INT does not granger causes INF;
the null hypothesis is accepted at 5% significance level, indicated
by the high probability value 0.8942. The results also revealed
that INF does not granger causes INT, the null hypothesis
is accepted at 5% percent indicated by the probability value
0.1264 and this is confirmed by the F-statistics value 2.32514.
This result therefore indicates no causation flowing from INT to
INF.
