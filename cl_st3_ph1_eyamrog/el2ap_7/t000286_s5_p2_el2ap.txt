The equation shows that government deficit and exchange rate is
seen having a positive impact on foreign direct investment in
Turkey with a coefficient of 0.000197 and 0.001518. This implies
that a unit change in GD and EXC will increase
FDI by 0.000197 and 0.001518 in Turkey. While, Inflation and
Interest rate is seen having a negative impact of FDI,
this implies that if interest rate or inflation rate decrease
by 0.007553 or 0.022135, FDI will decrease by such margin.
