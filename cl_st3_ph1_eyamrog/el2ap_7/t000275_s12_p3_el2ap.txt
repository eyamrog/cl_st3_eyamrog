Trocars placement and pneumoperitoneum: It is recommended to use a
Veress needle puncture technique to perform the pneumoperitoneum. The use
of intraperitoneal pressure should be the lowest safe for the
first puncture, and maintenance of the surgical field is desirable,
with levels between 10-15 mmHg. Before introducing any trocar, always
assure that its valves are closed to prevent inadvertent air
leakage from the pneumoperitoneum into the room.
