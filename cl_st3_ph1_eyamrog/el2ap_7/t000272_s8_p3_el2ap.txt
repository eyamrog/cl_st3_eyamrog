Therefore, many studies using bioactive compounds and plants have been
done (Lima et al. 2014, Macedo-Costa et al. 2017, Veloso
et al. 2020, Sette-de-Souza et al. 2014, Silva et al.
2012). In this context, the Schinopsis brasiliensis Engl., is used
in folk medicine to combat various diseases, including toothache, diarrhea,
flu and inflammations (Agra et al. 2006, Albuquerque 2006, Albuquerque
et al. 2007, Albuquerque et al. 2012). The bark of
S. brasiliensis presents polyphenols, flavonoids, tannins and saponins (Chaves et
al. 2015, Fernandes et al. 2015) and a lot of
compounds with biological activities have been isolated (Cardoso et al.
2005, Cardoso et al. 2015, Santos et al. 2017). In
this way, Santos et al (2014) detected the presence of
flavonoids and tannins in the hydroalcoholic extract of the bark
of S.brasiliensis, along with the absence of toxicity. These phenolic
compounds in the bark of this plant are degraded in
temperatures above 125 Â°C (Fernandes et al. 2013).
