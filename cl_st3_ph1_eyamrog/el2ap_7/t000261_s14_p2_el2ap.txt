Data sampling - We performed the samplings monthly over 20
consecutive years (1997-2017), always in the morning at the deepest
site of the reservoir and collected the water samples using
a van Dorn sampler and transferred to acid-rinsed bottles. We
determined water transparency using a Secchi disk, total phosphorus (TP)
concentration according to Valderrama (1981), and chlorophyll-a concentration corrected for
pheophytin using 90% ethanol (Sartory & Grobbelaar 1984).
