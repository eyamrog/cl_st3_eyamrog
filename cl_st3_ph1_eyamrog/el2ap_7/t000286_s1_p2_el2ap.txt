Also this study focuses on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows
and how they are linked with the economic indicators in
Turkey including the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER), and Gross
Domestic Product per capita of Purchasing Power Parity - GDP
(PPP) in Turkey. The GDP (PPP) variable is used because
it shows significant causality on REER, along with the exchange
rate volatility of the U.S Dollar in the Turkish stock
market.
