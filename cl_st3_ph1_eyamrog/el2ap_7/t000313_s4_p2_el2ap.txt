In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 is highly specialized for infecting humans of
all populations, i.e. it is a “human-population generalist coronavirus”, at
least considering its gateway to the cell, the ACE2. In
contrast, it is not a “generalist” coronavirus with the ability
to infect, naturally and easily, a range of other species,
including pets.
