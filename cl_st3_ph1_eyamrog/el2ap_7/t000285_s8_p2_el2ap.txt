In the midst of this scenario, countries in tropical regions
are also facing the issues of old endemic diseases (2).
In Brazil, for example, until mid-March 2020 more than 600,000
probable Dengue cases, almost 18,000 probable Chikungunya cases and over
2,000 probable Zika cases were notified in the year. Mortality
data add up to 224 in these human urban arboviruses
(3).
