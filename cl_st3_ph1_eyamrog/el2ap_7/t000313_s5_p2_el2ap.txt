SARS-CoV-like viruses use ACE2 as their gateway to the host
cell. Figure 2 illustrates the diversity of 70 ACE2 orthologues,
considering 30 potential binding sites to the S glycoproteins of
the SARS-CoV-like viruses. This fact opens up a wide range
of possibilities for this type of coronavirus, whose rate of
evolution is high, due to its high rates of mutation
and recombination (Li et al., 2020a). These phenomena that generate
variability in the RNA viruses explain why they change host
more frequently and jump between distantly related species more often
than other pathogens (Woolhouse et al., 2005a, 2005b; Davies and
Pedersen, 2008; Longdon et al., 2014). These facts would explain
a predicted origin of SARS-CoV-2 from original and/or intermediate phylogenetically
distant hosts (for instance, bat and pangolin; Guo et al.,
2020; Ji et al., 2020; Lam et al., 2020; Li
et al., 2020c; Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al.,
2020).
