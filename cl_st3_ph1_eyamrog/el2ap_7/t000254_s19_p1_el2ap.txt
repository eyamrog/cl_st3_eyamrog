Composition and Structure in 2012 - A total of 901
individuals were sampled (survivors from 2006 and the dead and
recruited during the study period, table 1), out of which
708 belong to the shrub-tree synusia, 190 to the climbers
and three to the hemiepiphytes (two recruited and one survivor).
Of the three ferns, which existed in 2006 and were
included in the shrub-tree group, one survived until 2012. The
growth rate for the group of all plants and sizes
reflected an increase in the total number of individuals (lambda
> 1, 95% CI = 1.003 + 0.003).
