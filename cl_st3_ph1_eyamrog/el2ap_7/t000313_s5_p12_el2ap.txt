Our findings reveal also that an essential part of this
taxon-specific ACE2 diversity can even be attributed to the positive
natural selection, since it is a membrane protein related to
the water intake, blood pressure control, and other cardiovascular conditions.
Besides that, a common trade-off of adapting to novel hosts
is that the performance on the original host is reduced
(Longdon et al., 2014). In other words, SARS-CoV-2 is a
coronavirus with high performance to infect Homo sapiens individuals, from
any population. In contrast, it could not infect, at least
with the same efficiency, other species, as well as jump
and re-infect the original or intermediate phylogenetically distant hosts (bats
and/or pangolins). New mutations and/or recombination can turn SARS-CoV-2 into
a derived-coronavirus capable of breaking down species barriers again, feeding
the endless cycle of the arms race between host and
pathogen.
