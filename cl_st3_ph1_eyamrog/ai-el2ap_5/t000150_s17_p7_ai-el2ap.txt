Brazilian migration to Portugal generates markedly distinct social realities, a
phenomenon that can be attributed to the specific dynamics of
kinship structures. The influence of kinship in shaping these outcomes
appears to be more significant than that of other social
mechanisms. In contrast, frameworks such as transnationalism and network theory,
as well as other approaches within the sociology of migration,
typically emphasize alternative processes and do not focus on the
role of kinship in producing such divergent outcomes. Consequently, the
realities shaped by kinship orders in this context can be
characterized as fundamentally different, resulting in highly dissonant social experiences
among Brazilian migrants in Portugal.
