The PNT and the PNM Serra do Mendanha (Pontes et
al. 2015) shared 25 amphibian species (Sørensen similarity index =
0.6; Magurran & McGill 2011) and 29 reptile species (Sørensen
similarity index = 0.8). Despite these similarities, 13 amphibian species
were recorded exclusively in the PNT, while 27 were exclusive
to the Serra do Mendanha. For reptiles, seven species were
exclusive to the PNT and ten to the Serra do
Mendanha. The observed similarities in herpetofaunal composition between these two
areas may be partially explained by their historical connection as
parts of a formerly continuous forest, and may also reflect
the outcomes of reforestation efforts in the Tijuca massif during
the 19th century (Rocha et al. 2003, Rocha 2017). Nevertheless,
the presence of unique species in each area highlights the
importance of conserving both forests to ensure the protection of
the herpetofauna of the Atlantic Forest.
