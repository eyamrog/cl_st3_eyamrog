The relatively smaller decrease observed in certain groups indicates a
less immediate impact, likely due to conditions that require specialized
care, such as epilepsy and lung diseases. An exception to
this pattern is observed in conditions that are already routinely
managed at this level of care and have an established
referral network, such as asthma. In contrast, the pattern of
chronic hospitalizations for conditions like diabetes supports their classification as
sensitive to the quality and organization of primary health care
(PHC) services. The effects on these chronic conditions are expected
to become more apparent over time.
