According to Social Dominance Theory (TDS), legitimating myths are defined
as a combination of prejudice, assumptions regarding the inferiority of
marginalized groups, and political conservatism (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999). These
myths contribute to the development of enduring ideological narratives that
become institutionalized and serve to justify existing structures of inequality
as both fair and desirable (Islam, 2014). TDS posits that
factors such as cultural ideologies, discriminatory behaviors, social roles, and
psychological tendencies toward group prejudice interact to sustain social group
hierarchies (Pratto et al., 2000). This framework provides a systematic
explanation for the persistence of group-based oppression, emphasizing that the
maintenance of social inequality is not merely the result of
individual actions but is embedded within broader systemic processes (Acosta,
2019).
