This study investigated the associations between meta-worry and clinically significant
symptoms of anxiety and/or depression among the Brazilian population during
the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. All statistical models
demonstrated strong performance, with explained variance approximately 40% and high
rates of correctly classified cases. The set of explanatory variables
remained consistent across different outcomes, exhibiting minimal variation. The analysis
identified age, steady income, perceived health status, and meta-worry as
key predictors of increased susceptibility to anxiety and depression symptoms.
Notably, living alone emerged as a significant predictor exclusively for
depressive symptoms.
