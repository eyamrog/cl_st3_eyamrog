To better understand the extent of missing data, we analyzed
the 2020 ranking, which includes 1,788 academic institutions. Among these,
39.84% of the data are missing, 5.70% are classified as
“not applicable,” and 54.46% are available. Brazilian institutions have approximately
10% less available data compared to the global average. A
further comparison can be made with European countries, particularly Spain,
given that “U-Multirank” originated in Europe. For the 79 Spanish
educational institutions included in the 2020 edition, 86.15% of the
data are available. Spain serves as an appropriate benchmark due
to its substantial representation in the ranking. Consequently, Brazilian institutions
have approximately 40% less available data than their Spanish counterparts.
