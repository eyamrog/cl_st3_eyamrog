In the second examination, conducted 30 days after administration of
the second dose of the antiparasitic agent, 32 fecal samples
were collected; 87.5% (28/32) tested positive for enteroparasites, and 53.13%
(17/32) of these positive samples exhibited polyparasitism. The prevalence of
protozoa and helminths in the samples was 84.4% (27/32) and
37.5% (12/32), respectively (Table 1). There was no statistically significant
difference in the overall, specific, or polyparasitism frequencies of enteroparasites
between the two coproparasitological examinations, except for the frequency of
Entamoeba histolytica/E. dispar cysts, which was significantly higher after treatment
(p = 0.0039). Although the overall frequency did not differ
significantly between the two examinations, geo-helminth eggs, including those of
hookworms, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Trichuris trichiura, were only detected prior
to treatment.
