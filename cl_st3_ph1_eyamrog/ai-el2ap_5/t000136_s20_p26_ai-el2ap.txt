Second, following the guidelines outlined by Sarstedt, Hair, Cheah, Becker,
and Ringle (2019), we assessed the measurement model of the
higher-order construct by examining the relationships between the higher-order component
and its lower-order components. Specifically, we evaluated unidimensionality using Cronbach’s
alpha and Dillon-Goldstein’s rho, both of which should fall between
0.7 and 0.9, as well as the dominance of the
first eigenvalue. Convergent validity was assessed by ensuring that outer
loadings exceeded 0.7 and that the average variance extracted (AVE)
was greater than 0.5. Discriminant validity was evaluated by confirming
that the outer loadings on a construct were higher than
all cross-loadings with other constructs, and that the square root
of the AVE for each construct exceeded its highest correlation
with any other construct, in accordance with the Fornell-Larcker criterion.
