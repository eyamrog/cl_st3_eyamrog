Germination tests were conducted using four replicates of 100 seeds
each, placed in plastic boxes (gerboxes) containing three sheets of
germitest paper moistened with either distilled water or saline solution
at a volume equivalent to 2.5 times the dry weight
of the paper. Following sowing, the boxes were incubated in
a Bio-Oxygen Demand (BOD) chamber maintained at a constant temperature
of 20 Â°C under continuous light. Germination was assessed by
counting the number of germinated seeds at seven and 28
days, with the final results expressed as a percentage, according
to the methodology described by Brasil (2009).
