According to Rodr√≠guez (1988), one of the most detrimental consequences
for women is the internalization of negative self-perceptions. In this
context, the historical oppression of Black women has resulted in
a particularly damaging outcome: the systematic erasure of their culture,
history, references, talents, abilities, capacities, and virtues. This process effectively
eliminates sources of pride, motivation, and the potential for acceptance
of difference and individuality, thereby contributing to their social invisibility.
