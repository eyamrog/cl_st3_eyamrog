Analysis of species distribution by origin indicates that native species
constitute the highest percentage at all sites. The PP and
FE sites (Fig. 4a and 4b) exhibited the greatest proportions
of native species, with 87% and 82%, respectively, while the
RZ site (Fig. 4c) had 51% native species. The highest
proportion of exotic species was observed in the RZ (Fig.
4d) and VP sites. This pattern may be attributed to
increased human activity in these areas, as they are locations
with higher traffic and are inhabited by landowners and employees.
Additionally, their proximity to the river, which serves as a
significant vector for the dispersal of propagules and plants, may
contribute to the greater presence of exotic species.
