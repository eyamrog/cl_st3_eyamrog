The study was conducted in the drylands of the Middle
Valley of the Rio Negro and its surrounding areas (38ยบ50'
to 39ยบ55' S; 65ยบ15' to 66ยบ35' W) (Fig. 1). The
surveyed region is predominantly utilized for extensive cattle production, with
a primary focus on breeding. Feedlot operations are uncommon in
this rainfed area (Klich et al., 2020).
