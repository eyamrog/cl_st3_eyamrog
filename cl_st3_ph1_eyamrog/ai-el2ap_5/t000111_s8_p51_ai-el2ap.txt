Medeiros Junior (2014) proposes that all free relatives in Brazilian
Portuguese are of the wh-ever type, based on their semantic
properties. The author argues that the wh-words in these constructions
are complex morphological forms created through a syntactic process involving
the incorporation of the determiner (D) into the complementizer (C),
which is triggered by the presence of a null -ever
suffix in D. In Brazilian Portuguese, wh-words in free relatives
are interpreted with universal force. According to this analysis, the
universal semantics of free relatives in Brazilian Portuguese is a
consequence of their syntactic derivation, as illustrated in diagram (46)9.
