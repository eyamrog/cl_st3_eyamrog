As previously noted, the proportion of exotic species increases in
areas where cultivation has occurred, where machinery traffic is frequent,
or in pastures subjected to excessive stocking rates. This is
of particular concern because 66% of these species (51 species)
are toxic or potentially toxic to cattle. Several authors (Krikor
& Hierro 2011; Peralta & Klich, in press) have highlighted
the risks associated with the introduction of adventitious species in
disturbed areas, many of which possess characteristics that are detrimental
to cattle production (Fig. 3c). Notable examples of these adventitious
species include Conium maculatum L. (Apiaceae), Diplotaxis tenuifolia (L.) DC.,
Hirschfeldia incana (L.) Lagr.-Foss., and Sisymbrium irio L. (Brassicaceae), Vicia
villosa Roth. and Trifolium repens L. (Fabaceae), and Cynodon dactylon
(L.) Pers. (Poaceae).
