The Fiscal Council serves as the supervisory body responsible for
overseeing the accounting and financial management of non-profit organizations (NPOs),
including its constituent elements such as election procedures, mandate, and
specific functions, notably the assessment of financial statements. This role
is distinct from that of the Board, which is primarily
concerned with ensuring the organization’s adherence to its stated purposes,
whereas the Fiscal Council focuses on supervising administrative actions and
providing formal opinions on the organization’s financial statements (Lamb, 2002).
The proper establishment of a Fiscal Council can function as
an additional safeguard for the interests of the principal.
