The Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome is recognized as one of
the world’s biodiversity hotspots (Myers et al. 2000), although it
has been reduced to approximately 12% of its original extent
due to centuries of intensive deforestation (Ribeiro et al. 2011;
SOS Mata Atlântica, INPE 2018). This biome supports an estimated
625 amphibian species (Haddad et al. 2013; Rossa-Feres et al.
2017) and 300 reptile species (Tozetti et al. 2017), with
new species continuing to be described (e.g., Cruz et al.
2019; Maciel et al. 2019; Prates et al. 2019). In
the state of Rio de Janeiro, 201 amphibian species have
been recorded, comprising 197 anurans and four caecilians (Dorigo et
al. 2018), along with 149 reptile species (Oliveira et al.
2020). The state exhibits a high level of endemism among
both amphibians (Dorigo et al. 2018; Rossa-Feres et al. 2017)
and reptiles (Tozetti et al. 2017), and its metropolitan region
is considered a significant area for the conservation of Brazilian
biodiversity (Oliveira et al. 2019).
