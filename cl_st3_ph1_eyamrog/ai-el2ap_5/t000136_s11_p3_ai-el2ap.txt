In summary, it is assumed that governance practices facilitate non-profit
organizations' (NPOs) access to the donations market, specifically by exerting
a positive effect on the level of donations received (Harris
et al., 2015). This assumption is supported by the understanding
that effective governance mitigates the agency problem arising from the
contractual relationship between the donor (principal) and the NPO (agent)
in the donation process (Jensen and Meckling, 1976).
