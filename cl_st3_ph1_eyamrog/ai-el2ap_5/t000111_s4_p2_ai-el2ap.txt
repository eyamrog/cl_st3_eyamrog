One of the primary arguments against analyzing the quem-sentences in
(1) as containing standard appositive relative clauses is the possibility
of eliding the anchor nominal in (1), a phenomenon not
observed in genuine appositive relative clauses, where the anchor is
the noun being relativized. Additionally, it has been argued that
in utterances such as (1), the anchor and the appositive
can exchange positions, which does not occur in the presence
of true appositive relative clauses.
