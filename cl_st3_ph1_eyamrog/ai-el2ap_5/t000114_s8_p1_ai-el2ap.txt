Bryophytes are nonvascular land plants comprising mosses (Bryophyta; Goffinet et
al. 2009), liverworts (Marchantiophyta; Crandall-Stotler et al. 2009), and hornworts
(Anthocerotophyta; Renzaglia et al. 2009). Typically small in size, bryophytes
colonize a wide range of substrates and ecosystems, with the
exception of marine habitats (Costa et al. 2010; Vanderpoorten &
Goffinet 2009). Their dependence on humidity is primarily due to
the presence of flagellated gametes and their poikilohydric water regulation,
resulting in a higher frequency in humid environments such as
the Atlantic Forest, which contains nearly 90% of the Brazilian
bryoflora (Costa et al. 2010; Costa & Peralta 2015). Conservation
Units (CUs) play a significant role in preserving the biodiversity
of forest remnants. The Parque Nacional do Caparaó (PNC), an
important conservation unit in southeastern Brazil, encompasses the country’s third
highest peak, Pico da Bandeira, which reaches 2,892 m above
sea level. The park’s extensive area supports a variety of
environments and vegetation types, contributing to high biodiversity that remains
incompletely documented. In addition to its ecological value, the park
features several waterfalls suitable for swimming, attracting substantial numbers of
visitors throughout the year. According to the most recent state
tourism report, from 2014 to 2017, the park received an
average of 10,000 visitors annually, with monthly peaks of up
to 2,500 during the high season (June–August) (ICMBio 2021a; OTE-ES
2018). Documenting the biological diversity of such environments that are
frequented by tourists is essential for effective conservation, as these
areas are as important as strictly preserved zones.
