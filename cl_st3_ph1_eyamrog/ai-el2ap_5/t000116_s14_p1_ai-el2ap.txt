This time-series study was conducted in the city of Rio
de Janeiro, Brazil, which has a documented history of expanding
primary care coverage and is frequently cited as a reference
case for primary care studies in Brazil and the Americas.
The analysis utilizes data from the Department of Health, comprising
monthly records of hospitalizations in public health system units with
universal coverage, disaggregated by disease code, from 2008 to 2019.
Hospitalization trends were assessed across three distinct periods relevant to
primary care in the municipality: January 2008 to December 2009,
representing the pre-reform phase prior to the reorganization of primary
care known as the Primary Health Care Reform (RCAPS); January
2010 to December 2017, corresponding to the period during which
the reorganization was implemented; and January 2018 to December 2019,
marking the initial phase of changes introduced by the new
National Primary Care Policy (PNAB).
