Pressure from business groups, along with a speech by Brazil’s
President Jair Bolsonaro advocating for vertical rather than horizontal isolation
(i.e., recommending that only high-risk groups self-isolate while others continue
their regular activities), conflicted with the preventive measures implemented by
certain governors and mayors. In the absence of effective restrictions
on population movement and with the reopening of non-essential activities,
the incidence of COVID-19 increased significantly. In response, many cities
and municipalities implemented the most stringent social isolation measures available
to prevent Intensive Care Units (ICUs) from exceeding their capacity
(Mendonça 2020). The duration of the pandemic remains uncertain, and
its effects on both the economy and citizens’ lives have
been extensive. This paper examines the impact of COVID-19 on
student access to and retention in higher education, with particular
attention to low-income groups.
