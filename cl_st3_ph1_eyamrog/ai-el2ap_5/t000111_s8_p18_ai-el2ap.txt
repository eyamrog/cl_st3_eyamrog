Focusing on appositive clauses in Brazilian Portuguese, the language displays
two distinct types of sentential appositives, similar to many other
languages: one with a nominal nature and another with an
adjectival nature, specifically a relative clause. The bracketed sentences in
examples (15) and (16) illustrate these two types.
