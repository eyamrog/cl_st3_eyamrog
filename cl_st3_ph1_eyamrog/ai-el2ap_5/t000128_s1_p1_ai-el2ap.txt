Microorganisms are increasingly developing resistance to commonly used chemical disinfectants,
highlighting the need to identify alternative agents. This study aimed
to evaluate the disinfectant activity of both extract and decoction
preparations from Libidibia ferrea (jucá) leaves on various surfaces. Two
extraction methods—decoction and hydroalcoholic extraction—were assessed using the Kirby-Bauer disk
diffusion technique, bacterial growth curve analysis, a population acceptability test,
and a surface disinfection assay. The results indicated that the
decoction exhibited activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, while
the hydroalcoholic extract was effective against S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
Micrococcus spp., Corynebacterium spp., and Salmonella Typhimurium in the disk
diffusion assay. Both the decoction and extract, at a concentration
of 100 mg/mL, resulted in a reduction of bacterial load,
as measured by absorbance, after 24 hours for Escherichia coli,
E. faecalis, Micrococcus spp., and Klebsiella pneumoniae. In the surface
disinfection test, a reduction in bacterial load was observed for
all tested strains. These findings suggest that L. ferrea leaf
preparations may serve as effective alternative disinfectant agents.
