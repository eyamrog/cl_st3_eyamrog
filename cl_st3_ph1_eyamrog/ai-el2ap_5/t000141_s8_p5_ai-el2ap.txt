The lack of a minimum national guideline for economic reopening
resulted in significant discrepancies among the recovery plans developed by
individual federative units, particularly regarding the number and quality of
indicators utilized, the metrics adopted, and the transparency and reliability
of the data sources selected. This situation, combined with the
limited availability of scientific literature analyzing policies for easing restrictions,
prompted a comprehensive review and analysis of all economic recovery
plans. This approach enabled an assessment of the degree of
objectivity and standardization that informed government decisions on the relaxation
of social isolation measures in each state.
