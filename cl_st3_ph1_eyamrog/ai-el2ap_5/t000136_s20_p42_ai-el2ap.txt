This reflection is closely related to the assumption in agency
theory regarding differing planning horizons, which suggests that the principal’s
involvement with the nonprofit organization (NPO) is transient and limited
to the duration of the contractual relationship, typically corresponding to
a specific project. According to Jensen’s (1993) classification as applied
to the third sector, the donation market functions as a
complement to the legal and regulatory political system, serving as
an external governance mechanism for NPOs. This role is particularly
significant in the context of Brazil, where the general legal
framework is characterized by low levels of regulation and limited
legal security.
