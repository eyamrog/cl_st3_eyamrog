This section analyzes two significant discursive events that contributed to
the emergence of these themes: the reports authored by Edgard
Faure (1973) and Jacques Delors (1998) for UNESCO. Subsequently, the
analysis will examine how the foundational premises of these reports
are reflected in the Brazilian National Education Guidelines and Basic
Law of 1996.
