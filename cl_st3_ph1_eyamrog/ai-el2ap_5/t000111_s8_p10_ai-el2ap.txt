Both types of appositives have been described as being coordinated
with their anchors, as supported by several studies (see DÃ¶ring,
2014; Ott, 2014). However, Griffiths (2015), based on substantial empirical
evidence, argues that reformulative apposition functions as a coordinated structure,
whereas attributive appositives constitute elements that integrate a finite parenthetical
copular clause containing unpronounced material, specifically the copula and the
relative pronoun.
