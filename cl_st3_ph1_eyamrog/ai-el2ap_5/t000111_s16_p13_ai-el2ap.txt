Juxtaposition differs from modification (Mathews, 1981); for example, modification is
present in (54), whereas it is absent in (47). Additionally,
as discussed in the section on headed relative clauses, standard
headed relative clauses introduced by QUEM can occur in Brazilian
Portuguese only when QUEM is selected by a preposition.
