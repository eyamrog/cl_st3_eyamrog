Lacuneolimna novagallia Tudesque & Le Cohu is differentiated from Lacuneolimna
zalokariae Tudesque & Le Cohu (2015: 21) by the presence
of continuous depressions on the valve face, wider costae, and
a more developed cross-bar network, as described by Tudesque et
al. (2015). In the present study, L. novagallia was detected
in 0.6% of the core samples, with a maximum relative
abundance of 2%. The species was identified in samples dated
to the Late Holocene (~1,790 calibrated years BP). This study
represents the first documented occurrence of L. novagallia in Brazil.
