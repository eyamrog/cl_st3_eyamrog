The third aspect concerns the effects of the emergence of
the learning society as discussed in the reports by Edgar
Faure and Jacques Delors, in the LDBEN 9.394/1996, and in
the interview with Noah Webster Sobre, all of which emphasize
significant changes in the contemporary social fabric with respect to
education. Notably, these sources highlight the expansion of educational environments
beyond traditional school settings. A related development is the deterritorialization
of educational spaces, whereby learning is increasingly recognized as occurring
in diverse environments such as open spaces, gardens, parks, and
public squares. The most profound transformation, however, involves the integration
of information and communication technologies (ICTs) into education, a process
that was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This shift has
led to the widespread adoption of remote and online teaching,
resulting in the replacement of traditional physical classrooms with virtual
learning environments. While terms such as "Google Classroom" are still
used, this transition may represent a fundamental change in the
conceptualization of educational spaces. It is not suggested that traditional
educational institutions will be entirely supplanted by online platforms, nor
is this an endorsement of online teaching; rather, the argument
is that the COVID-19 pandemic may have expedited a significant
transformation in contemporary society, characterized by the de-schooling, deterritorialization, and
dematerialization of longstanding educational institutions.
