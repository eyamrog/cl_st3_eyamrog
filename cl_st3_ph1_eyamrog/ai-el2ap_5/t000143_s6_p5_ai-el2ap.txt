Income concentration, as measured by the GINI index, demonstrated an
inverse association with femicide rates in the final spatial model,
indicating that areas with lower social inequality exhibited higher femicide
rates. This finding contradicts the results of Leite et al.
(2017), who reported a direct relationship between social inequality and
femicide rates. However, the same study identified regional exceptions, such
as Esp√≠rito Santo State, which displayed lower inequality but higher
rates of female mortality due to aggression compared to other
Brazilian states analyzed. It is important to emphasize that, although
socioeconomic factors are associated with femicide, the determinants of violence
are not limited to poverty and social inequality. This underscores
the multifactorial nature of violence against women, which arises from
the interaction of individual, relational, social, cultural, and environmental factors.
