Vriesea altobocainensis is a species native to the Atlantic Forest
of Serra da Bocaina, distinguished by its robust growth form,
infundibuliform rosettes, and patent inflorescence branches with apical portions that
are ascending to slightly sigmoid, a feature also observed in
certain species of Alcantarea (E. Morren ex Mez) Harms. The
species exhibits red primary and floral bracts and distichous flowers.
Although V. altobocainensis is typically epiphytic, it can also be
found growing terrestrially when individuals fall from the forest canopy.
