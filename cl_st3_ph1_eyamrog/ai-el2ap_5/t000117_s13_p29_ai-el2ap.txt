In "Schools of the Forest: The Open-Air Model of Children’s
Education in Europe and in Spain," Ananda Casanova (2019) reconstructs
the historical development of this pedagogical approach, which originated in
the 1950s in Northern Europe and has experienced significant dissemination
over the past thirty years in Spain and other regions,
including the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, India,
Israel, and several Latin American countries such as Brazil. These
educational models are positioned as alternatives to conventional teaching methods
and have emerged from both individual and collective initiatives, receiving
formal recognition and governmental support in countries such as Germany,
the United Kingdom, and Denmark. As demonstrated by Casanova’s study,
educational approaches that emphasize children’s interaction with nature are not
new; their earliest forms were associated with the cultural value
placed on outdoor life in Nordic countries. However, the current
expansion of these models is linked to contemporary societal challenges.
In the conclusion of the article, the author effectively summarizes
the motivations underlying the recent resurgence of interest in open-air
education.
