A visual inspection of the central tendency and dispersion measures
was conducted (Figure 1). Six distinct patterns were identified when
comparing the baseline period (Period 1) to the RCAPS period
(Period 2), and the RCAPS period (Period 2) to the
PNA period (Period 3). The first pattern, characterized by an
initial decrease in mean rates followed by stabilization, was observed
in total rates as well as in the groups for
hypertension, angina, epilepsy, and female pelvic inflammatory diseases. The second
pattern, involving a decrease in both comparisons, was found in
vaccine-preventable diseases, infectious gastroenteritis, bacterial pneumonia, and diabetes. The third
pattern, defined by an initial increase followed by a subsequent
decrease, was present in nutritional deficiencies, gastrointestinal ulcers, and diseases
related to the prenatal and puerperal periods. The fourth pattern,
consisting of an initial reduction followed by an increase, was
observed in asthma and other lung diseases. The fifth pattern,
characterized by increases in both comparisons, was identified in cerebrovascular
diseases, kidney and urinary tract infections, and skin diseases. The
final pattern included groups with no apparent change across the
periods, specifically anemia, ear, nose and throat infections, and heart
failure.
