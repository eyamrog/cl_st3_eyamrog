Analysis of the relationship between these plant species and cattle
indicates that 30% (93 species) of the total identified taxa
are consumed by cattle. Among the consumed species, herbaceous plants
were the most prevalent, accounting for 59% (55 species), of
which 31 species were grasses. Shrub or sub-shrub species comprised
33% (31 species) of the consumed taxa, while the remaining
species belonged to the arboreal group (Fig. 3a).
