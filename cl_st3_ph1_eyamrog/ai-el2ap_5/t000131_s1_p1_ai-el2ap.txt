In tropical and subtropical regions, lianas contribute significantly to ecological
succession. This study evaluated the photosynthetic and morpho-physiological responses of
two Mikania species, Mikania glomerata Spreng. and Mikania laevigata Sch.
Bip ex Baker, under varying light conditions: full sun (I0),
and 25% (I25), 50% (I50), and 75% (I75) retention of
solar radiation. Plants grown under I75 exhibited a reduced net
photosynthetic rate (A). Dynamic photoinhibition was observed at I0 during
periods of high irradiance and temperature. Leaf chlorophyll content was
highest at I75 and lowest at I0, whereas the carotenoid
to total chlorophyll ratio and leaf thickness increased under I0.
Total dry mass was greater in plants grown at I0
and I25. Mikania laevigata showed higher net photosynthetic rates and
biomass production at I25, while Mikania glomerata accumulated more biomass
between I0 and I50. These results indicate that M. laevigata
and M. glomerata exhibit distinct morpho-physiological responses to the same
radiation conditions.
