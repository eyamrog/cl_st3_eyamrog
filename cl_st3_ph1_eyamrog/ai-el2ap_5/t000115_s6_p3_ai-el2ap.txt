Albendazole (ABZ) was selected as the primary agent for controlling
parasitic infections in the studied population. It has been administered
to millions of individuals in various countries for the treatment
of geohelminthiasis. ABZ is associated with few side effects and
low toxicity due to its poor absorption by the intestinal
mucosa and rapid elimination from the body. Its single-dose administration
is advantageous for large-scale geohelminth infection control campaigns, and it
is further characterized by a broad spectrum of activity and
low cost. Although ABZ can also be used to treat
giardiasis, the effective regimen for this indication is 400 mg
per day for five days. In Brazil, ABZ is provided
free of charge by the Unified Health System for geohelminthiasis
control and is available as 400 mg chewable tablets administered
in a single dose.
