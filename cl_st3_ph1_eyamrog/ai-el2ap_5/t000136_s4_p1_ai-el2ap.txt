This paper analyzes the influence of governance, including its specific
dimensions, on the receipt of donor-restricted donations by environmental non-profit
organizations (NPOs) in Brazil. The results provide evidence that NPOs
with higher levels of governance are more likely to receive
donations. Furthermore, certifications issued by the Brazilian government to NPOs
did not moderate the relationship between governance levels and the
amount of donations received.
