This study has certain limitations. Due to the lack of
access to the explanatory notes of all Financial Statements, it
was not possible to differentiate among types of donors, such
as government donors, private foundations, and corporate foundations. Since different
donor types may have distinct motivations for making donations (Kuti,
2008), it is not possible to exclude the possibility that
donor type may influence the relationship between governance and donation
levels.
