Stomatal index (SI) and stomatal density (SD) both increased with
higher levels of radiation (Table 2). The highest SI and
SD values for both species were recorded at 150 days
after transplantation (DAT) under the I0 and I25 treatments. For
M. glomerata grown under I0, SI and SD were 18.05%
and 256 stomata/mm², respectively, whereas for M. laevigata under the
same condition, SI and SD were 14.41% and 176 stomata/mm²,
respectively. Across all levels of solar irradiance, M. glomerata consistently
exhibited higher SI and SD values compared to M. laevigata.
