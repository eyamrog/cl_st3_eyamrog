The data indicate that the trends across the years are
largely consistent, with minor improvements observed in certain indicators during
2019 and 2020, particularly in Indicator 1 (Bachelor graduation rate),
Indicator 2 (Master graduation rate), and Indicators 24 to 27
(Foreign language bachelor programmes, Foreign language master programmes, Student mobility,
and International academic staff). These findings suggest a gradual increase
in data availability; however, the overall level of data completeness
remains suboptimal. Specifically, only 12 out of 35 indicators (34.29%)
have more than 90% data availability in at least one
year. Consequently, the analysis of the performance of Brazilian institutions
will focus on these 12 indicators to provide a more
reliable assessment based on the available information.
