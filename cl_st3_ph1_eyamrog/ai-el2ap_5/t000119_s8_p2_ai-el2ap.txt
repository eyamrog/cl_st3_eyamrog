The study of water relations is essential for understanding the
seed germination process under water stress conditions. Approximately 20% of
all irrigated land is currently affected by salt stress (Taiz
et al., 2017). The primary causes of soil salinization include
inadequate agricultural practices, such as the excessive use of fertilizers
with high salt content and the improper implementation of irrigation
methods (Cruz et al., 2017). Salinity reduces crop yield by
decreasing soil water availability and introducing toxic chemical elements, particularly
sodium and chlorine (Souza et al., 2014). Additionally, salinity can
cause protein denaturation and membrane destabilization, which collectively reduce above-ground
plant growth and inhibit photosynthesis (Taiz et al., 2017).
