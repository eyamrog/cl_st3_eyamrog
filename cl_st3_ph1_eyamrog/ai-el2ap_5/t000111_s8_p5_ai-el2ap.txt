It is therefore necessary to seek an explanation for these
observations, which appears to be found in the characterization of
both sentence types and in the description of their syntactic
and semantic properties. To conduct this analysis, I will first
provide a brief overview of the characteristics of apposition, followed
by an examination of appositive sentences, with particular attention to
the Brazilian Portuguese data presented in examples (1) and (2).
The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 1
addresses apposition in general, including sentential apposition and the typology
of sentential apposition in Brazilian Portuguese. Section 2 focuses on
Brazilian Portuguese QUEM sentences, with particular emphasis on free relative
sentences. Section 3 presents the analysis developed in this study,
and Section 4 offers the final remarks.
