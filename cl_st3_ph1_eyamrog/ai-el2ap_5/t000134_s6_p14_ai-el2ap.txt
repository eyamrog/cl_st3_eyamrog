Of the reptile species recorded in the present study, only
the tortoise Chelonoidis denticulatus is considered to be at risk
of extinction, being classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN (2020),
although it is listed as Least Concern in Brazil (ICMBIO
2018). The presence of C. denticulatus in the Atlantic Forest
of Rio de Janeiro was first documented in 1820 by
Prince Maximilian zu Wied-Neuwied, who reported finding carapaces of this
species on the sandy plains in the northern part of
the municipality of Cabo Frio (Vanzolini 1994; Vargas-Ram√≠rez et al.
2010; Vanzolini & Myers 2015). Although C. denticulatus was originally
recorded in the Atlantic Forest, evidence suggests that it has
since been extirpated from the forests of eastern Brazil (Vanzolini
& Myers 2015). Currently, this species is being reintroduced into
the PNT by the Refauna Project (Refauna 2019).
