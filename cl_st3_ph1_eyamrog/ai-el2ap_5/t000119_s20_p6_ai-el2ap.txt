Under saline soil conditions, reduced water potential impedes the absorption
of water necessary for seed germination. Imbibition in the presence
of high concentrations of sodium chloride can lead to the
rupture of seed coat layers, resulting in damage to the
embryo and, in some cases, embryo mortality (Freitas et al.
2013). The effects of salinity arise from complex interactions among
morphological, physiological, and biochemical processes that influence seed germination, plant
growth, and the uptake of water and nutrients (Akbarimoghaddam et
al. 2011). Salinity impacts nearly all stages of plant development,
including germination, vegetative growth, and reproductive development (Bano & Fatima
2009).
