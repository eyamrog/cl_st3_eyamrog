The next dimension to be analyzed is Research, for which
substantially more data are available compared to the Teaching and
Learning dimension. This increased data availability is primarily due to
the fact that the indicators for research publications (size-normalized), citation
rate, top-cited publications, and interdisciplinary publications are derived from open
sources. In contrast, only the indicators for external research income,
art-related output, and post-doctoral positions rely on reports provided by
the institutions themselves.
