Given the heterogeneous nature of the causes included in the
list, it is expected that some may exhibit immediate changes
in response to modifications in primary care policy, while others
may demonstrate more gradual changes. Accordingly, two types of effects
between trends were assessed: differences in the slope of hospitalizations
between two groups were analyzed using an interrupted time series
approach to evaluate the ramp effect, and changes in the
level of trends between groups were examined to assess the
step effect.
