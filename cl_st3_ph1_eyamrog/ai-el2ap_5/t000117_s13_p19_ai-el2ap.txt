Generally, such items reflect concepts found in the reports by
Faure (1973) and Delors (1998), which advocate for education aimed
at developing learners' capacities and competencies in relation to their
social environment. Similarly, item IV, which addresses basic education, emphasizes
"the strengthening of family ties, bonds of human solidarity and
of reciprocal tolerance" (Brasil, 1996), a perspective that aligns with
the Delors report (1998) through its focus on the principle
of living together.
