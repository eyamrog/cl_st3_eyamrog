Leaves are asymmetrical to falcate when dry; stem leaves are
ovate or oblong-lanceolate, while branch leaves are lanceolate with a
cuspidate apex. The species exhibits inflated alar cells and two
to three rows of supra-alar cells. The specimens examined were
collected from sun-exposed rocks in open environments; however, the species
generally occurs as corticolous and epixylous in the Atlantic Forest,
where it is common at high altitudes. It has been
recorded in the Brazilian states of Amazonas, Bahia, Espírito Santo,
Minas Gerais, Paraná, Rio de Janeiro, Santa Catarina, and São
Paulo. This species is endemic to Brazil.
