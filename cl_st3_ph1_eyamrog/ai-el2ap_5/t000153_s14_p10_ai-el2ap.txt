In this study, abortion stigma is defined as “the discrediting
of individuals as a result of their association with abortion”
(Norris et al., 2011, p. 49), with a specific focus
on how this stigma is manifested and perpetuated by healthcare
providers. To capture the complexity of stigma in real-world contexts,
it is conceptualized as a convergence of interrelated components, including
the labeling of human differences, the creation and association of
stereotypes with negative attributes, the resulting social separation between groups,
and the subsequent disapproval, rejection, and discrimination that occur within
a framework of power relations (Link and Phelan, 2001; Phelan,
Link, and Dovidio, 2008). The process of stigmatization requires the
exercise or access to social, economic, and political power, which
enables the emergence, construction, and cultural maintenance of difference through
socially constructed categories (Link and Phelan, 2001). Thus, power is
a necessary condition for the existence and perpetuation of stigma.
