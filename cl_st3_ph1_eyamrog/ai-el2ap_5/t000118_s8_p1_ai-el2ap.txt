Vriesea Lindl. is classified within the subfamily Tillandsioideae, which has
undergone taxonomic revision and the establishment of new genera based
on phylogenetic and morphological analyses (Barfuss et al. 2016). In
its current circumscription, Vriesea is primarily distinguished by the presence
of a convolute blade II type stigma, characterized by lobes
that are approximately fused, spreading, strongly broadened, and infundibuliform to
umbrella-shaped, as well as petals that typically possess basal appendages
(Barfuss et al. 2016). Species of Vriesea are epiphytic, terrestrial,
or rupicolous, and are predominantly distributed in South America, with
the Brazilian Atlantic Forest identified as a major center of
diversity for the genus (Costa et al. 2007). According to
Forzza et al. (2015), Vriesea is the most species-rich genus
of Bromeliaceae in Brazil, comprising nearly 230 species (Gouda et
al., continuously updated). It is also among the most diverse
genera within the Atlantic Rainforest domain, with approximately 170 species
recorded (BFG 2018; Flora do Brasil 2020, in preparation).
