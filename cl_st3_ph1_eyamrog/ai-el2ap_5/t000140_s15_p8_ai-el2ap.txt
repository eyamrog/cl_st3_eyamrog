In addition, students were asked to identify textbooks, and training
was provided for this task. For the purposes of this
study, textbooks assigned to students, as well as trade books
in general, are not classified as "assigned readings" because students
purchase these materials independently, thereby compensating authors and publishers directly,
rather than through an Access Copyright tariff as is the
case with assigned readings.
