Understanding the responses of different plant species to excess salt
exposure is essential for identifying effective salinity management strategies in
arid and semi-arid regions, which are increasingly impacted by soil
salinization (Oliveira & Silva, 2019). Accordingly, the present study aimed
to assess the germination and early development of common rue
under varying saline concentrations.
