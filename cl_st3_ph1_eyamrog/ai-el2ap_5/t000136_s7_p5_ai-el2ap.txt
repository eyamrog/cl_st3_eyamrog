Previous studies have made significant contributions to understanding the influence
of governance on donations by examining the effects of individual
governance factors or dimensions. However, the literature has not yet
fully addressed the potential impact of governance conceptualized as a
latent variable, comprising a set of interrelated dimensions, on donations
received by nonprofit organizations (NPOs). While some governance dimensions have
been found to affect donations and others do not—as demonstrated
by Harris et al. (2015), who reported a positive association
between six out of seven governance dimensions and donations—these findings
clarify the effects of specific governance dimensions rather than governance
as an overarching latent construct. Therefore, the central research question
of this study is whether governance, considered as a second-order
construct, has an effect on donor-constrained donations.
