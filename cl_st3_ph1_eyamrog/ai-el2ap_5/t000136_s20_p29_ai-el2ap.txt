This result reinforces the relevance of agency theory, which provided
the theoretical foundation for this study, by demonstrating that the
presence of governance mechanisms has a positive effect on donations.
This finding is consistent with the work of Singh and
Indgdal (2007), who identified that donors in Nepal consider a
range of governance practices when deciding to contribute to nonprofit
organizations (NPOs). The implementation of governance practices facilitates NPOs’ access
to the donations market by promoting more efficient and effective
operations, as noted by Greiling and Stötzer (2015). Furthermore, improved
governance enhances the organization’s reputation in both product and factor
markets, reduces information asymmetry, and lowers agency costs, thereby increasing
the likelihood that agents will allocate resources in accordance with
the interests of principals and mitigating agency problems.
