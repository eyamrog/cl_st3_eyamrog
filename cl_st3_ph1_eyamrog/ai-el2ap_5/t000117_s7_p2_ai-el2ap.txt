Beyond this news item circulating on the internet, the notion
that the future will require information and communication technologies (ICTs)
to transform teaching and learning is not limited to media
discourse. Examination of broader discursive contexts reveals that this idea
is not new; it has previously been proposed as an
alternative to traditional education, emphasizing a future-oriented model based on
continuous and lifelong learning facilitated by technological tools and diverse
learning environments. Referred to as the "learning society" (Noguera-Ram√≠rez, 2009),
this paradigm has shaped the agendas of international organizations such
as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO),
and has significantly influenced the development and implementation of public
policies in various countries.
