The methodology described by Engel et al. (2017) was adapted
to assess the surface disinfectant effects. Plastic, steel, and ceramic
surfaces were washed and sterilized prior to use. The surfaces
were then exposed to an inoculum at a concentration of
approximately 10^8 CFU/mL for 30 minutes to allow biofilm formation.
Subsequently, disinfectant solutions at a concentration of 100 mg/mL, as
well as a control product, were applied by spraying for
15 minutes over an area of 1 cm^2. Following treatment,
samples were collected using a sterilized swab, and the number
of microorganisms was quantified using the plate count technique as
described by Tortora, Funke, and Case (2012).
