Data analysis was conducted for the four identified sites: Plateau
Plain (PP), Foot of Escarpment (FE), Valley Plain (VP), and
Riparian Zone (RZ). The distribution and number of taxa at
each site are presented in Table 2. The results indicate
that the Riparian Zone (RZ) exhibited the highest richness in
terms of families, genera, and species, accounting for 72.88%, 59.39%,
and 47% of the total, respectively. The Valley Plain (VP)
also demonstrated high taxonomic richness, with 54.23% of families, 55.84%
of genera, and 54.33% of species represented.
