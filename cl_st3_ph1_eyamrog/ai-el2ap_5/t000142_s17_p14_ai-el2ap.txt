The null hypothesis (𝐻0) states that the coefficients 𝛽2, 𝛽3,
𝛽5, and 𝛽6 are all equal to zero (𝛽2 =
𝛽3 = 𝛽5 = 𝛽6 = 0), indicating that these
variables have no statistically significant effect on the dependent variable.
The alternative hypothesis (𝐻1) asserts that at least one of
these coefficients is not equal to zero (𝛽2 ≠ 0,
𝛽3 ≠ 0, 𝛽5 ≠ 0, or 𝛽6 ≠ 0),
suggesting that at least one of the variables has a
statistically significant effect on the dependent variable.
