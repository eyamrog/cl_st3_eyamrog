With the expansion of the agricultural frontier into northern Patagonia
at the end of the twentieth century, valley areas were
converted into significant agricultural production systems, primarily consisting of orchards
and pastures. The development of complex irrigation infrastructure supported the
growth of these agricultural activities. In contrast, non-irrigated dryland areas
were utilized for extensive grazing of domestic herbivores, which rely
on the spontaneous vegetation present on the plateau, particularly in
the context of cattle rearing (Zeberio 2012).
