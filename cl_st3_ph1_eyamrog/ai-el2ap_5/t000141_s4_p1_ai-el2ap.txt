Based on the data presented and considering the objective of
the study, it can be concluded that the normative frameworks
of the Brazilian states exhibited variation in both configuration and
characteristics, primarily due to the lack of an effective national
policy to coordinate actions among the states. As a result
of the adoption of divergent policies across different levels of
government, state-level plans—characterized by a fragmented approach to the relaxation
of restrictions—became predominant.
