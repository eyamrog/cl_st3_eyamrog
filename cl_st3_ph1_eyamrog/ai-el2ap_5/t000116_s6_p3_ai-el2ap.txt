The trend in hospitalizations for obstetric causes in 2017 indicates
that such hospitalizations increase as care coverage expands at this
level of healthcare. This pattern is likely associated with improved
access to health services, which facilitates the identification and subsequent
hospitalization of cases that might otherwise go undetected. In contrast,
the absence of significant changes in hospitalization rates for conditions
such as anemia and infections of the nose, ear, and
throat is consistent with findings from previous studies. These results
suggest that these conditions may not be particularly sensitive to
interventions at this level of care.
