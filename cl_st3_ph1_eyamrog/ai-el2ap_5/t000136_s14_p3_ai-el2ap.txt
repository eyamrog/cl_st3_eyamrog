Given a significance level of 0.05, a statistical power of
0.8, an effect size of 0.35, and six predictors, the
minimum required sample size was 46 observations. Since the moderation
analysis was conducted using a multigroup approach with two groups,
the minimum total sample size was set at 92 observations,
corresponding to two groups of 46 each. Based on these
parameters, the sampling plan was developed as shown in Table
1.
