Pratto (1994) examines the psychological dimension of TDS by proposing
that an individual variable, termed Social Dominance Orientation (SDO), reflects
the degree to which a person desires their group to
dominate and be superior to other groups. SDO is conceptualized
as an attitudinal orientation toward intergroup relations, indicating a preference
for hierarchical relationships structured along a superior-inferior continuum (Pratto et
al., 1994). While these beliefs may confer advantages to certain
group members, their adoption by members of subordinate groups can
inhibit participation in collective actions aimed at addressing social inequalities
and prejudice (Islam, 2014).
