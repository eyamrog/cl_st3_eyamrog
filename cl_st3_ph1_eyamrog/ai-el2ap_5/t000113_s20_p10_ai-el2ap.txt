Family experiences reinforce these legitimizing myths during the early stages
of a child's development, shaping how individuals relate to others
in adulthood. The individual's perceptions of people and events are
represented by unconscious mental objects. In this context, legitimizing myths
contribute to barriers against the development of female social roles
by perpetuating specific beliefs and perceptions, such as the recurrent
recognition of male achievement at the expense of female achievement,
as illustrated in Table 01 and referenced in the interview.
