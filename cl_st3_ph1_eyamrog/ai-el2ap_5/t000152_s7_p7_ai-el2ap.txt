This study utilizes data from state institutional sources and legislative
documents, as well as literature from civil organizations such as
Oxfam, Fundação Getulio Vargas (Getulio Vargas Foundation), and the Associação
Brasileira de Mantenedoras do Ensino Superior (Brazilian Association of Higher
Education Administrators). Additional sources include census data, legislator records, and
journalistic articles on the COVID-19 pandemic published in major national
newspapers, news magazines, and websites such as UOL, Estadão, Agência
Brasil, and Veja. The paper is organized in accordance with
the research question into two main sections: the first section,
"A Short History of Higher Education," provides a historical overview
of higher education in Brazil; the second section, "The Impact
of COVID-19 on Higher Education in Brazil," analyzes the effects
of the pandemic on student retention in higher education, focusing
on factors such as social isolation, employment and income instability,
the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), internet access,
and technological resources. The study concludes with policy recommendations aimed
at improving access to higher education.
