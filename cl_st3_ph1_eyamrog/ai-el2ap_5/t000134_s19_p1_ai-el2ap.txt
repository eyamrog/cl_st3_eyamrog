A total of 74 herpetofaunal species, representing four orders, were
recorded at Parque Nacional da Tijuca (PNT), comprising 38 amphibians
(37 anurans and one caecilian; Table 1) and 36 reptiles
(three chelonians, one amphisbaenian, nine lizards, and 23 snakes; Table
2). Among amphibians, the family Hylidae exhibited the highest species
richness (N = 10), followed by Brachycephalidae (N = 5)
and Cycloramphidae (N = 5) (Table 1). With the exception
of Gymnophthalmidae, which included two species, all lizard families were
represented by a single species each. The snake family Dipsadidae
was represented by 14 species, while Colubridae included five species
(Table 2). Over the 36-month study period, field surveys in
Sector A of the park yielded 3,288 individuals representing 49
species. The majority of individuals (N = 3,174) were amphibians
(Table 1), comprising 24 species from the orders Anura (N
= 23) and Gymnophiona (N = 1) (Figures 2–4). In
contrast, only 114 reptiles were recorded, although these represented 25
species (Table 2) distributed across the orders Chelonia (N =
2) and Squamata (N = 23) (Figures 5–7). Additionally, two
amphibian species and 11 reptile species were detected opportunistically during
the study period, outside of standardized surveys (Tables 1 and
2).
