This study has several limitations. First, it relied on publicly
available secondary data from the Ministry of Health. During pandemic
conditions, there may have been reduced accuracy or completeness in
data reporting and updating by healthcare professionals. Additionally, some relevant
information, such as data on hypertension, was not available. The
only data provided by the Ministry of Health at the
municipal level pertained to the number of procedures performed. In
ecological studies, such as this one, the data do not
directly measure the quality of or access to care, but
they may highlight underlying issues within primary health care (PHC)
services. Ecological study designs are also susceptible to systematic differences
between areas in the measurement or recording of variables. Furthermore,
the estimates derived from this study do not imply causality,
and it is not possible to make inferences at the
individual level from aggregate data, as this is not a
causal inference study.
