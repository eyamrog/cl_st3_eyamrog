Photosynthetic pigments – The effects of solar radiation flux retention
on photosynthetic pigment concentrations were similar in both species. Significant
effects of solar irradiance and species were observed on total
chlorophyll and carotenoid contents (figure 3; supplementary material table S2).
Pigment concentrations increased under conditions of low light availability. Plants
grown under I0 exhibited a reduction in chlorophyll and carotenoid
content during the experiment (figure 3a–d). In M. glomerata, chlorophyll
and carotenoid concentrations were 5.6-fold and 4.0-fold higher, respectively, in
the I75 treatment compared to the I0 treatment at the
end of the experiment (150 DAT) (figure 3a, c). In
M. laevigata, these differences were 4.9-fold for chlorophyll and 3.6-fold
for carotenoids. At the same sampling point, both species under
I25 exhibited, on average, a 3-fold increase in chlorophyll and
a 2.5-fold increase in carotenoids compared to plants under I0
(figure 3b, d). In both species, the carotenoid/chlorophyll ratio was
higher in plants grown under I0 than in those grown
under higher levels of shading (I75) (figure 3e, f).
