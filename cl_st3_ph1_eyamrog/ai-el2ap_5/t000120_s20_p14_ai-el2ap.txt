The richness of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) species in the
treatment group during the dry season may have been affected
by gravimetric soil moisture and the presence of Urochloa brizantha.
For effective restoration of the area, complete removal of U.
brizantha is essential; however, both manual and mechanized removal methods
can alter the physical and microbiological properties of the soil.
Chemical removal methods may not only introduce contaminants but also
disrupt the life cycles of soil microorganisms. Therefore, it is
necessary to develop a removal technique that minimizes impacts on
soil structure and microbial composition.
