Procedures have been developed and implemented to prevent the contamination
of cultures. Surface decontamination methods for macroalgae include the use
of chemical agents such as antibiotics, disinfectant solutions (e.g., detergent,
povidone iodine, sodium hypochlorite, sodium hydroxide), as well as physical
techniques such as brushing and washing (Oliveira et al. 1995;
Kawai et al. 2005; Bravin et al. 2006; Shea &
Chopin 2007; Fernandes et al. 2011; Holdt et al. 2014;
Saminathan et al. 2014; Yong et al. 2014; Kerrison et
al. 2016; Ali et al. 2018). However, these decontamination methods
must be optimized for each macroalgal species, as the efficacy
and potential adverse effects of chemical treatments can differ significantly
among species (Fernandes et al. 2011).
