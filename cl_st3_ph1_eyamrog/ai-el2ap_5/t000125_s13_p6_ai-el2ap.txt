Figure 1 presents the standard graphical representation of results provided
by “U-Multirank” (https://www.umultirank.org/). The diagram displays five dimensions, each represented
by a distinct color: Teaching and Learning (green), Research (pink),
Knowledge Transfer (blue), International Orientation (orange), and Regional Engagement (purple).
Each dimension comprises several indicators, depicted as segments within the
circle. The indicators for Teaching and Learning are: (1) Bachelor
graduation rate, (2) Master graduation rate, (3) Graduating on time
(bachelor), and (4) Graduating on time (master). The Research dimension
includes: (5) External research income, (6) Research publications (size-normalized), (7)
Art-related output, (8) Citation rate, (9) Top cited publications, (10)
Interdisciplinary publications, and (11) Post-doctoral positions. Knowledge Transfer is represented
by: (12) Income from private sources, (13) Co-publications with industrial
partners, (14) Patents awarded (size-normalized), (15) Industry co-patents, (16) Spin-offs,
(17) Publications cited in patents, and (18) Income from continuous
professional development. International Orientation includes: (19) Foreign language bachelor programmes,
(20) Foreign language master programmes, (21) Student mobility, (22) International
academic staff, (23) International doctorate degrees, and (24) International joint
publications. Regional Engagement comprises: (25) Bachelor graduates working in the
region, (26) Student internships in the region, (27) Regional joint
publications, (28) Income from regional sources, and (29) Master graduates
working in the region. Further details, including the methodologies used
to calculate the scores, are available in the U-Multirank Indicator
Book (https://www.umultirank.org/export/sites/default/press-media/documents/Indicator-Book-2020.pdf). It should be noted that not all 36
indicators from the 2020 ranking are included in the graphical
representation; specifically, the following indicators are omitted: Research publications (absolute
numbers), Strategic research partnerships, Professional publications, Open Access publications, Patents
awarded (absolute numbers), Graduate companies, and Regional publications with industrial
partners.
