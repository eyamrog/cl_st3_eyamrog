Nadia Kubota (2014) demonstrates that the relationship between immigrants from
Okinawa and those from mainland Japan in Campo Grande (MS,
Brazil) has historically been characterized by tension. Cohabitation was challenging,
and the Second World War intensified divisions between so-called "defeatists,"
who accepted Japan's defeat, and "victorists," who did not. This
conflict is notably associated with the emergence of Shindo Renmei,
a small group of "victorists" who sought to punish the
"defeatists." In Campo Grande, as in several other locations with
Japanese and Okinawan migrant populations, a clear division has persisted
between Okinawans, often labeled as "defeatists," and Japanese from the
mainland, often identified as "victorists."
