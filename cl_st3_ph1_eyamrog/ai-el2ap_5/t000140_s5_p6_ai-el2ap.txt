This approach would provide professional writers with compensation for their
work in university courses that is comparable to the income
they receive from bookstore sales. There is a rationale for
imposing a higher fee on social sciences and humanities majors,
as their courses typically assign a greater number of media
pieces and trade book chapters compared to science courses. Additionally,
charging students based on the specific readings assigned in their
courses could be considered. However, the current proposal concerns a
uniform fee payable to Access Copyright by all students, for
which an amount of $1.40 per student is supported by
our syllabus analysis. This method also minimizes the risk of
students being charged multiple times for access to academic materials.
Overall, under this scheme, approximately 1.2 million full-time university students
in Canada, or their institutions, would collectively pay $1,769,888 annually
to Access Copyright for the assigned readings.
