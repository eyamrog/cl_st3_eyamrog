Stefanello et al. (2018) reported similar findings when assessing the
effects of varying salt concentrations on the germination of common
thyme seeds (Thymus vulgaris L.), noting that both NaCl and
CaCl2 negatively affected seed germination and vigor at osmotic potentials
of -0.3 MPa and -0.2 MPa, respectively. In a related
study, Mguis et al. (2011) investigated the germination of common
rue seeds under NaCl concentrations corresponding to osmotic potentials ranging
from 0 to 0.7 MPa and found that germination was
significantly inhibited at NaCl concentrations exceeding 0.1 MPa. Furthermore, Yamashita
et al. (2009) observed a decrease in the germination percentage
of common rue seeds with increasing NaCl concentration, with significant
reductions occurring only at osmotic potentials of -0.8 MPa or
lower; the lowest germination percentage, 22%, was recorded at an
osmotic potential of -1.0 MPa.
