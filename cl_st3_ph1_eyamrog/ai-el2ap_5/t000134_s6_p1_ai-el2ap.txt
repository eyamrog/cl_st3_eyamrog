The results of this study demonstrate that the forests of
the PNT contain a substantial proportion of the herpetofaunal diversity
found in the Atlantic Forest of the state of Rio
de Janeiro. Based on both fieldwork and secondary data, the
park supports at least 38 amphibian species, representing 19% of
the amphibian species recorded in the state (N = 201;
Dorigo et al. 2018), 6% of those in the Atlantic
Rainforest (N = 600; Rossa-Feres et al. 2017), and 3%
of the amphibian species in Brazil (N = 1,136; Segalla
et al. 2019). The integration of primary and secondary data
also confirms the presence of 36 reptile species in the
PNT, corresponding to 24% of the reptile species known from
Rio de Janeiro state (N = 149; Oliveira et al.
2020), 12% of those in the Atlantic Rainforest (N =
300; Tozetti et al. 2017), and 4% of the national
reptile diversity (N = 795; Costa & BÃ©rnils 2018). Considering
the area surveyed and the sampling effort, the number of
amphibian and reptile species recorded in the PNT aligns with
expectations. The cumulative species curves for both groups reached an
asymptote by approximately the midpoint of the study period, indicating
that the sampling effort was sufficient. Additionally, the confidence intervals
of the rarefaction curves for amphibians converged to zero, further
supporting sampling adequacy, while those for reptiles approached convergence, indicating
a reduced estimation error.
