The variation in the assignment of readings across the three
areas has implications for the rationale behind imposing a uniform
fee on all students, an issue that will be revisited
in the discussion section. Additionally, the infrequent assignment of journal
articles in science warrants consideration of its pedagogical consequences, as
students in this field have fewer opportunities to engage directly
with recent research compared to their counterparts in the social
sciences and humanities.
