The number of simple indicators adopted in each state varied
significantly, ranging from 2 to 11, and should not be
used in isolation to assess the effectiveness of state plans.
Detailed and structured plans were identified in states with differing
numbers of indicators, such as SÃ£o Paulo and Rio Grande
do Sul, which had 5 and 11 indicators, respectively. Beyond
government measures that are not formalized in official documents but
still influence decision-making, certain components of the plans are associated
with more effective pandemic response policies. These components include the
incorporation of parameters for monitoring testing policies, the definition and
periodic reassessment of indicator cutoff points, the careful determination of
criteria required for transitions between phases of restriction easing, and
the development of a regionalized policy framework. Such a framework
enables resource management and the adjustment of intervention stringency according
to the epidemiological situation at both micro and macro levels.
