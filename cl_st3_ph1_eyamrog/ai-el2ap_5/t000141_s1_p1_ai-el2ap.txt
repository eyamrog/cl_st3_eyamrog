In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the
COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. In Brazil, the rapid spread of
the virus necessitated the implementation of nationwide restrictive measures, and
discussions regarding the resumption of economic activities began in April.
By mid-December 2020, Brazil had reported 6,970,034 confirmed cases of
COVID-19 and 182,799 related deaths.
