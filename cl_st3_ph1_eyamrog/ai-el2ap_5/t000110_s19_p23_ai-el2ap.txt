This species was originally described by Hustedt (1952: 392, fig.
99-100) as Cocconeis pulcherrima and was subsequently transferred to Achnanthes
pulcherrima by Metzeltin and Lange-Bertalot (1998: 18, pl. 69, fig.
9-14; pl. 70, fig. 1, 4; p. 366, pl. 66,
fig. 1-9). However, this transfer was deemed invalid because the
basionym was not cited (Coste et al. 2010). Based on
the presence of a cavum, a rimmed depression in the
central area of the valve that is characteristic of the
genus, the species was later transferred to Planothidium by Coste
et al. (2010). In the present study, it was found
in only 2% of the core samples, with a maximum
relative abundance of 1%. Its occurrence was restricted to samples
corresponding to the end of the Mid-Holocene (~5,479 cal. yr
BP). This study provides the first record of this species
in Brazil under its correct nomenclature and represents the first
documented occurrence of the species in the Brazilian Amazon.
