In recent years, the Brazilian Amazon basin has seen the
description of a substantial number of new diatom species (Wetzel
et al. 2010a, 2010b, 2011, 2012a, 2012b; Burliga et al.
2013; Tremarin et al. 2013a, 2014a, 2014b; Pereira et al.
2014, 2015, 2017; Almeida et al. 2017, 2018; Canani et
al. 2018), indicating that current knowledge of diatom diversity in
this region remains limited. The new records presented in this
study represent a 75% increase in the total number of
diatom records for the Brazilian Amazon, further emphasizing that the
region is still insufficiently studied and that its biodiversity is
likely significantly underestimated. Additionally, this study demonstrates the value of
a paleolimnological approach as an effective method for assessing long-term
changes in biodiversity and for expanding the understanding of diatom
diversity, particularly within Amazonian ecosystems.
