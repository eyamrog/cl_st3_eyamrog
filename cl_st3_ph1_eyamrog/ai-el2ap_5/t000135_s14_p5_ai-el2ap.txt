The analysis was conducted using STATA 16.0 software (https://www.stata.com). Descriptive
statistics, including mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and median values,
were calculated for the variables. To assess the association between
the procedures and the impact of COVID-19 from February 2018
to December 2020, a multilevel mixed-effects negative binomial regression was
employed. Variable selection for the adjusted model was performed using
a stepwise backward procedure, retaining only those variables with a
p-value less than 0.250 in the final model. Incidence rate
ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals were estimated in
the regression analyses.
