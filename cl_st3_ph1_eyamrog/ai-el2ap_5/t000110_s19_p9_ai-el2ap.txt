The present species resembles S. dubia (Grunow) Morales & Manoylov;
however, according to the authors, S. subcapitata (Frenguelli) E.A. Morales
possesses less lanceolate and less silicified valves than S. dubia.
S. subcapitata was observed in 98% of all core samples,
with a maximum relative abundance of 15%. This species was
identified in all subsamples from the Late Holocene (~4,000 cal.
yr BP) to the core top (~300 cal. yr BP).
Although S. subcapitata has previously been reported in the Brazilian
Amazon, specifically in the Negro River (Wetzel 2011), the present
study constitutes the first published record of this species for
the broader Brazilian Amazon region.
