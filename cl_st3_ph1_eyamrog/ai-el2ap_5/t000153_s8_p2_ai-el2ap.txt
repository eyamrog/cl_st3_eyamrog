Abortion-related stigma has been identified as a significant factor contributing
to various adverse outcomes for women, particularly by causing delays
in accessing abortion services (Fiala and Arthur, 2014). Research in
the health-focused social sciences has established that stigma associated with
seeking or providing abortion care affects both the accessibility and
location of services, as well as the willingness of healthcare
providers to offer such care (Ganatra et al., 2017, p.
2373). Furthermore, scholars have emphasized the importance of recognizing and
addressing stigma as a predictive factor influencing abortion safety, as
well as reproductive morbidity and mortality risks (Ostrach, 2016, p.
1).
