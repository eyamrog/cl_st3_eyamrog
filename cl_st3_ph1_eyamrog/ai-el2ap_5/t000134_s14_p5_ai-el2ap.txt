Species endemism in the Atlantic Forest was determined for amphibians
using the criteria established by Lingnau et al. (2008), Haddad
et al. (2016), and Frost (2020), and for reptiles following
Tozetti et al. (2017). The conservation status of each species
was assessed based on information from the IUCN Red List
(IUCN 2020), the Red List of Threatened Brazilian Fauna (ICMBIO
2018), and the List of the Threatened Fauna of Rio
de Janeiro State (Bergallo et al. 2000). Population trends for
each species were obtained from the IUCN (2020).
