The SARS-CoV-2 virus has resulted in a major global health
crisis, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a
pandemic in March 2020 (Pan American Health Organization 2020; Vibha
et al. 2020). Shortly after this declaration, Brazil, the largest
country in Latin America, reported its first confirmed case and
first death due to COVID-19 (Federative Republic of Brazil 2020a).
As of 30 September 2020, Brazil ranked as the third
most affected country globally, with 4,780,317 confirmed cases and 143,010
deaths (worldometers.info, 2020). On the same date, the global number
of reported cases was 33,249,563, with 1,000,004 deaths (World Health
Organization 2020). Although several countries where the disease was initially
detected had reported relative success in controlling transmission, reopening their
economies, and maintaining public health measures such as social distancing,
Brazil had not yet reached its epidemiological peak.
