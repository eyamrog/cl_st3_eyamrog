Biomass of the thalli was measured weekly using an analytical
balance during each replacement of the culture medium. Prior to
weighing, thalli were gently blotted with paper towels to remove
excess surface water. Relative growth rates (RGR) were calculated at
the end of the cultivation period using the formula recommended
by Yong et al. (2013): [(Wt/Wi)^(1/t) - 1] Ã— 100,
where Wt is the wet weight after t days, Wi
is the initial wet weight, and t is the duration
of the cultivation period in days. Wet weight and RGR
were used as indicators of thalli health.
