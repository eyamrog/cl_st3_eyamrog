Among the indigenous schoolchildren included in this study, the age
group most affected by helminth infection was five to nine
years, which exhibited a significant increase in infection frequency from
14% to 37.4% following mass treatment of the population (p
= 0.0185). Younger children represent a key risk group due
to their frequent contact with contaminated soil and underdeveloped hygienic
practices. This finding underscores the need to implement additional control
strategies beyond pharmacological interventions. Although current recommendations suggest that the
assessment of parasitological health indicators should include evaluation of reductions
in parasite burden, no quantitative methods were employed during the
coproparasitological examinations in this study, representing a limitation. Consequently, it
was not possible to determine the impact of the intervention
on the intensity of geohelminth infections.
