Epiphytic plants, 0.8–1.7 m tall at flowering. Leaf rosettes are
infundibuliform. Leaf sheaths measure 23 × 9–14 cm, broadly elliptic,
and dark brown; leaf blades are 36–72 × 5.5–7.5 cm,
linear-lanceolate, green with darker, tenuous transverse stripes, and have an
acute-attenuate, mucronate apex. The peduncle is 50–63 cm long, erect,
and green or reddish towards the apex; peduncle bracts are
imbricate, with the lower bracts green, foliaceous, suberect, sheaths approximately
5 × 6.5 cm, broadly ovate, and blades approximately 40
× 5.5 cm, narrowly triangular, decreasing in size towards the
apex; upper bracts have dilated sheaths, approximately 6 × 7
cm, orbicular, reddish, with blades suberect to patent, approximately 10
× 3 cm, lanceolate, green, with an attenuate, mucronate apex.
The inflorescence is a compound, heterothetic double raceme, erect, 35–100
cm long; branches number 10–21, sometimes with bracts bearing undeveloped
branches at the base and middle portions of the inflorescence;
branches are 13–30 cm long, usually patent with an ascending
to slightly sigmoid apical portion, bearing (8–)10–20 flowers. Primary bracts
are generally longer than the peduncles of the branches but
shorter than the branches themselves, measuring 4.5–12 × 6–8 cm;
the lower bracts are distinctly larger, similar to the peduncle
bracts, with sheaths approximately 7 × 8 cm, reddish, dilated,
and blades 10 × 3 cm, lanceolate, green, patent, decreasing
in size towards the apex; upper bracts are shorter than
the peduncle of the branches, approximately 4.5 × 6 cm,
orbicular, red, with a mucronate apex and lacking blades. The
peduncle of the branches is 2–8.5 cm long, each with
a sterile bract; the lower branches may have up to
two sterile bracts, similar to the floral bracts, approximately 3.5
× 2.2–4 cm, carinate. The rachilla is red or reddish-green,
slightly geniculate, with internodes 0.8–1.1 cm long in flowering branches
and up to 2.2 cm in fruiting branches. Floral bracts
are 2.1–3.5 × 2–3 cm, orbicular to broadly ovate, almost
completely enclosing the base of the rachilla, with an obtuse,
apiculate, carinate, red apex; they are equal in length to
the sepals or, in the distal portion of the branch,
red with a yellow apex and shorter than the sepals,
suberect and imbricate before anthesis, subpatent and spaced after anthesis,
thereby exposing the rachilla. Flowers are distichous, suberect at anthesis;
sepals are approximately 2.5 × 1 cm, narrowly ovate, yellow,
with an acute, mucronate apex, and are not carinate; petals
are approximately 3.2–3.5 × 0.7 cm, ligulate, yellow with a
slightly orange apex, rounded at the apex; petal appendages number
two, are bilateral to the antepetalous filament, longitudinally adnate to
the petal for approximately 4 mm, with the superior free
portion ovate to rhombic-ovate, apex rounded or obtuse, and margins
entire. Stamens are approximately 2.8 cm long, with three free
in the outer whorl and three in the inner whorl
epipetalous, adnate for approximately 0.4 cm; anthers are approximately 0.5
cm long and linear. The gynoecium is 3–3.4 cm long,
with a cylindrical ovary and axile placentation. The fruit is
a capsule, 3.5–4.5 × 1.4 cm; seeds are approximately 1.7
cm long, with a funicle approximately 1 cm long.
