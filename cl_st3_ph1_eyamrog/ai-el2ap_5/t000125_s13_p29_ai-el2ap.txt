As shown in Table 2, in 2017 São Paulo State
University (UNESP) demonstrated a clear advantage, with an average score
of 2.81 points, compared to 1.56 points for the Federal
University of Mato Grosso, which ranked second. All other universities
scored below 1.0 point, with minimal variation among them; specifically,
only 0.32 points separate the third and last positions. UNESP
leads in all evaluated dimensions, with particular distinction in “Teaching
and Learning,” where it achieved 3.25 points—a dimension in which
only UNESP and the Federal University of Mato Grosso (2.00
points) reported data—and in “Regional Engagement,” where UNESP obtained a
score of 4.00, compared to 1.17 for the Federal University
of Mato Grosso. The underlying factors contributing to these results
require further investigation; however, it is relevant to note that
UNESP has significantly expanded its number of campuses in recent
decades by incorporating smaller private academic institutions across various cities
in São Paulo state.
