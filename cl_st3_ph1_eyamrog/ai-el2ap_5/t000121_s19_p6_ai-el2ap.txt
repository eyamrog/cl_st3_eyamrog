In the analysis of the outcome related to the presence
of both sets of symptoms (fourth model), individuals aged 24
years or younger were twice as likely to exhibit these
symptoms compared to both the 31â€“39-year-old group and those over
39 years of age (OR = 0.5; 1/OR = 2).
The absence of a steady income (OR = 1.3) and
self-perception of being ill (OR = 2.4) were associated with
increased odds of experiencing both anxious and depressive symptoms compared
to individuals with a steady income and those who perceived
themselves as healthy, respectively. Additionally, participants who scored above the
mean on the meta-worry scale were approximately 13 times more
likely to present both sets of symptoms than those who
scored at or below the mean (OR = 12.7).
