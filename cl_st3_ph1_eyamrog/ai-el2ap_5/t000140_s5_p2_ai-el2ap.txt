Library holdings and open access should be systematically reviewed. An
artificial intelligence system would analyze a universityâ€™s syllabuses to identify
which assigned readings are accessible to students via institutional licenses
or open access platforms. Materials not currently licensed by the
university would be flagged as acquisition recommendations. The ongoing evaluation
of academic resources prioritized by instructors informs the subsequent step.
Non-academic readings lacking institutional licenses would proceed to the third
step for further processing.
