Sediment and various mangrove organisms, including microalgae, protozoa, fungi, nematodes,
microcrustaceans, annelids, small molluscs, chironomid larvae, and trombiculid mites, are
associated with the Bostrychietum (García et al. 2016; Vieira et
al. 2018). In addition, epiphytic macroalgae and endophytic fungi may
also be associated with Bostrychia species (De Felício et al.
2015). Consequently, establishing laboratory cultures of Bostrychia sp. that are
free from contaminating organisms (i.e., unialgal cultures) is challenging, and
there is a need for surface decontamination protocols specifically adapted
for Bostrychia species.
