Epiphytic plants with infundibuliform leaf rosettes. Leaf sheaths are broadly
elliptic and dark brown; leaf blades are linear-lanceolate with an
acute-attenuate, mucronate apex. Peduncle bracts are imbricate, with the lower
bracts green, foliaceous, and suberect, and the upper bracts possessing
dilated, orbicular, reddish sheaths and suberect to patent, lanceolate, green
blades. The inflorescence is a compound, heterothetic double raceme with
10–21 branches that are patent, with an ascending to slightly
sigmoid apical portion, each bearing (8–)10–20 flowers. Primary bracts are
red, longer than the peduncles of the branches but shorter
than the branches themselves. The peduncle of each branch bears
1–2 sterile bracts. The rachilla is red, slightly geniculate, with
short internodes approximately 1 cm in length. Floral bracts are
red or red with a yellow apex, orbicular to broadly
ovate, with an obtuse, apiculate, carinate apex. Flowers are distichous
and suberect at anthesis; sepals are yellow, and petals are
yellow with a slightly orangish apex, rounded at the tip.
Each petal has two appendages that are longitudinally adnate, with
the superior free portion ovate or rhombic-ovate, apex rounded or
obtuse, and margins entire. Anthers are included to slightly exserted,
and the ovary is cylindrical. Seeds possess long funicles.
