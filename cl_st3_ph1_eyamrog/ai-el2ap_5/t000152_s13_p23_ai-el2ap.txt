Although internet access remains unevenly distributed, mobile phone usage has
increased among socially disadvantaged Brazilians, likely due to the relative
affordability of these devices. According to the 2018 National Household
Sample Survey (NHSS), 96% of Brazilian households owned at least
one mobile phone. The Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Report
further indicates that the majority of Brazilians access the internet
via mobile phones for routine activities; however, it also notes
that significant limitations persist for tasks requiring higher connectivity and
greater data capacity (Brazilian Institute of Statistics and Geography 2019,
p. 101).
