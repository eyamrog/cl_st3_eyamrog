Metacognitive processes are significant in the context of worry, as
they contribute to the generation, correction, assessment, and regulation of
thoughts, and are closely associated with the development and maintenance
of psychological disorders (Dinis & Gouveia, 2011). Elevated levels of
worry are generally linked to a range of psychiatric symptoms,
many of which are characteristic of common mental disorders such
as anxiety and depression. During the COVID-19 pandemic, media exposure
has been shown to elicit both unrealistic optimism and negative
thoughts, potentially intensifying distorted health-related predictions and excessive worrying (Faro
et al., 2020). Empirical studies examining the relationship between worry
and mental health have consistently found that anxiety and depression
are prevalent in contexts characterized by excessive worry (Huang &
Zhao, 2020; Topper, Emmelkamp, Watkins, & Ehring, 2017).
