Overall, only six of the species recorded in the PNT
(Allobates olfersioides, Cycloramphus eleutherodactylus, Scinax trapicheiroi, Thoropa lutzi, Vitreorana eurygnatha,
and V. uranoscopa) are listed under some category of extinction
threat (Bergallo et al. 2000; ICMBIO 2018; IUCN 2020), although
populations of 15 species are considered to be declining (IUCN
2020). Of these six threatened species, only S. trapicheiroi was
detected during our field surveys. S. trapicheiroi is classified as
Near Threatened by the IUCN due to its restricted area
of occurrence, which is less than 20,000 km² (Rodrigues &
Carvalho-e-Silva 2004), but it is listed as Least Concern in
the Brazilian red list (ICMBIO 2018). Verdade and Rodrigues (2007)
synonymized three other nominal species—A. alagoanus (Bokermann, 1967), A. capixaba
(Bokermann, 1967), and A. carioca (Bokermann, 1967)—with Allobates olfersioides (Lutz,
1925), thereby extending the distribution of A. olfersioides along much
of the eastern coast of Brazil, from Rio de Janeiro
to the state of Alagoas, a distance of approximately 2,000
km. However, Haddad et al. (2013) continued to recognize these
geographically separated populations as distinct species: A. olfersioides in Rio
de Janeiro, A. capixaba in Espírito Santo, and A. alagoanus
in Alagoas. Clarification of whether these populations represent distinct species
or lineages of a single species remains necessary (Forti et
al. 2017). In their assessment of the conservation status of
this amphibian, Haddad et al. (2016) considered only A. carioca
to be a synonym of A. olfersioides, which restricted the
distribution of A. olfersioides to the metropolitan region of Rio
de Janeiro. Under this taxonomic arrangement, the reduction in area
of occurrence to approximately 7,730 km², the absence of recent
records from several localities including the PNT over the past
30 years, and ongoing habitat degradation have resulted in the
classification of this species as Vulnerable in both the Brazilian
red list (ICMBIO 2018) and the IUCN Red List (2020).
