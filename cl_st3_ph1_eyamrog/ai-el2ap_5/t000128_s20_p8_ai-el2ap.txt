The results of the acceptability evaluation of the disinfectant, based
on the variables of smell, color, texture, and surface aspect
(cleanliness and brightness), are presented in Table 5. Across all
evaluated criteria, the disinfectant formulated from L. ferrea leaves demonstrated
higher acceptability, with the highest acceptance frequency observed for aroma
(83.6%). There are no previous reports in the literature regarding
the acceptability of natural products used as disinfectants. However, Teixeira
and Becker (2017) state that 70% alcohol is the most
effective product for surface disinfection and sanitation, exhibiting efficacy comparable
to sodium hypochlorite when applied with a minimum contact time
of 10 minutes.
