This taxon resembles Stauroneis sylviabonillae Metzeltin, Lange-Bertalot & García-Rodríguez in
its lanceolate valve shape; however, Stauroneis sp. exhibits smaller valve
dimensions and a higher striae density compared to those reported
by Metzeltin et al. (2005: length 103–120 µm, width 20–22
µm, striae 15–16 in 10 µm). Additionally, S. sylviabonillae possesses
proximal raphe fissures that are slightly deflected, a characteristic not
observed in Stauroneis sp. The material examined also differs from
Stauroneis anceps Ehrenberg (1843: 291–445 105) due to its narrower,
more rostrate, and elongated apices (Bahls 2011). In the present
study, Stauroneis sp.1 was found in 5% of the core
samples, with a maximum relative abundance of 2%. Its occurrence
was restricted to samples corresponding to the Late Holocene (~2,909
cal. yr BP).
