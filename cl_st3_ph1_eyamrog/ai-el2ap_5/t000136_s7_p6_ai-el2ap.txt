In this study, we analyzed environmental non-profit organizations (NPOs) in
Brazil that had received grants from sponsors to perform specific
activities, using an agency theory framework. Furthermore, empirical research involving
samples of NPOs in contexts characterized by low regulatory oversight
and limited access to information on NPO governance, such as
Brazil, remains scarce (see, for example, Hasnan et al., 2016).
