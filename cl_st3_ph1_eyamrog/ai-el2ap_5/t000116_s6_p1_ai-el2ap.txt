The definition of lists of ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSCs)
typically involves systematic reviews of the literature and expert consensus.
The Brazilian ACSC list is considered among the most comprehensive
internationally. These conditions represent a significant source of demand on
the health system. The observed reduction in the overall rate
of ACSC hospitalizations associated with the implementation of the Rede
de Cuidados à Pessoa com Doença Crônica (RCAPS) in the
city is consistent with findings from previous studies conducted in
Rio de Janeiro and other regions of Brazil. Certain population
groups may exhibit a more rapid response to the implementation
of primary health care (PHC) services. In the short term,
increased access to health services can contribute to the prevention
of hospitalizations for conditions strongly influenced by social determinants, such
as nutritional deficiencies; for health problems that can be managed
at the PHC level, such as urinary tract infections; and
for the stabilization of chronic diseases, including asthma and hypertension.
