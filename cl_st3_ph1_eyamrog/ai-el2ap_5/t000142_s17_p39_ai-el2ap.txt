The unit root test based on soft transition, originally developed
by Leybourne, Newbold, and Vougas (1998), was subsequently extended to
incorporate two soft transitions and introduced into the literature by
Harvey and Mills (2002). In addition, three distinct models were
formulated for application within this testing framework.
