The development of the governance construct represents a significant contribution
to the agency theory approach in the context of third
sector relationships. Yetman and Yetman (2012) introduced specific measures for
governance; however, much of the existing literature has focused on
factors or indicators associated with particular dimensions of governance, such
as the Board (Harrison and Murray, 2015), Disclosure (Blouin et
al., 2018), and Accountability (Tacon et al., 2017), and has
primarily examined the effects of these individual indicators, rather than
the governance construct as a whole, on various measures of
donation (Hasnan et al., 2016). Only a limited number of
studies have investigated a more comprehensive set of indicators for
the governance construct (Blouin et al., 2018), and even fewer
have explored the impact of the overall governance construct on
donation outcomes (Harris et al., 2015). Agency theory is based
on the premise that agency problems arise from the contractual
relationship between principals and agents (Jensen and Meckling, 1976), and,
from this perspective, governance comprises a set of internal and
external mechanisms designed to mitigate these agency problems (Jensen, 1993).
