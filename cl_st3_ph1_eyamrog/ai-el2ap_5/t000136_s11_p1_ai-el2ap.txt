This study adopts the agency theory perspective as its primary
theoretical framework. The analysis is grounded in the classical approach
developed by Jensen and Meckling (1976), which has served as
the foundation for numerous subsequent empirical investigations and the development
of new theoretical models (e.g., Eisenhardt, 1989; Glaeser, 2003).
