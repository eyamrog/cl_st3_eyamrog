The overall model adjustment was assessed using the Goodness-of-Fit index
(GoF), which yielded a value of 0.4177. According to the
gradation proposed by Wetzels et al. (2009), a GoF value
of 0.1 is considered low, 0.25 is considered average, and
0.36 is considered high. Based on these criteria, the model
in the present study demonstrates a high level of overall
fit.
