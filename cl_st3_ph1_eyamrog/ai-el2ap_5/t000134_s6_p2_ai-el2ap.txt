In comparison with PNM Serra do Mendanha, another significant remnant
of dense rainforest within the urban zone of Rio de
Janeiro for which systematic medium-term data are available, the findings
of the present study are broadly consistent. Pontes et al.
(2015) reported 45 amphibian and 39 reptile species at PNM
Serra do Mendanha, which are similar to the 38 amphibian
and 36 reptile species recorded at PNT in this study.
The amphibian species richness observed at PNT is also relatively
high compared to other forested areas in the state of
Rio de Janeiro for which comparable data exist (Table 3).
Although species richness varies considerably among sites, much of this
variation is likely attributable to differences in survey methodologies, sampling
effort, and study periods (Table 3).
