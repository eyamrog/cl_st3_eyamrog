Common rue should be cultivated in neutral, well-drained soils that
are periodically irrigated and exposed to full sunlight. Once established,
the plant exhibits tolerance to drought but is sensitive to
waterlogged conditions. Its development is favorable in semi-arid environments, as
it can grow in nutrient-poor soils and withstand elevated temperatures
(Corrêa Júnior et al., 1994). However, there is limited research
on various agronomic aspects of this species, particularly regarding its
response to saline stress.
