Distinctions between the two Brazilian kinship systems in Portugal and
the three kinship systems that emerged from the Okinawan experience
in Brazil and Japan are contingent upon specific analytical frameworks.
These distinctions do not necessarily reflect the differences that manifest
in everyday life. The purpose of this analysis is to
demonstrate that an approach centered on kinship enables the identification
and examination of significant and meaningful differences among these groups.
Thus, I employ an anthropological conception of kinship to emphasize
the diverse forms of kinship produced by migrant populations.
