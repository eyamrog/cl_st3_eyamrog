Recession, unemployment, and poverty resulting from crises have been shown
to negatively impact psychological well-being. According to a report published
by the World Health Organization (WHO) during the COVID-19 pandemic,
factors contributing to the increased risk of violence against women
include unemployment, economic difficulties, prolonged periods spent at home, and
elevated stress levels. The primary underlying cause of rising domestic
violence is identified as the prevailing patriarchal structure and gender
inequality. The extended cohabitation of potential perpetrators and victims within
specific socio-geographic contexts facilitates conditions conducive to violence, consistent with
several criminological theories. Empirical evidence indicates that unemployment is associated
with family breakdown, alcohol dependence, criminal activity, and violence; for
example, a 1% increase in the unemployment rate over a
six-year period has been linked to 37,000 additional deaths, 920
suicides, 650 homicides, 4,000 psychiatric hospitalizations, and 3,300 incarcerations. Numerous
studies have demonstrated that increases in unemployment and income inequality
are correlated with higher crime rates. Nikolaos and Alexandros (2009)
reported a negative short-term relationship between wages and crime rates.
Lombardo and Falcone (2011) found that regions with higher divorce
rates, youth unemployment, and female employment exhibit the highest crime
rates. Andresen (2012) identified a significant positive association between income
and violent crime, as well as between long-term unemployment rates
and violent crime. Taş et al. (2014) observed a similar
relationship between unemployment and divorce rates. Kavaklı (2020) found that
femicide predominantly occurred in economically less developed areas. Overall, economic
development appears to mitigate the negative effects of these risk
factors.
