COVID-19 has also disrupted secondary education in Brazil and is
expected to affect access to higher education. The Brazilian Association
of Higher Education Administrators (2020c) has indicated that, for instance,
delays in administering the National High School Examination (ENEM) may
result in future shortages of skilled labor. The transition from
school to the labor market has already been significantly affected
by the pandemic. The ENEM, which serves as a key
public policy instrument for higher education admissions, has become the
subject of considerable political debate during the pandemic. The Ministry
of Education, in contrast to World Health Organization guidelines, initially
maintained the original schedule for the examination in November 2020.
Various sectors of society opposed this decision and sought judicial
review regarding the appropriateness of the schedule. Ultimately, the Ministry
of Education agreed to postpone the ENEM by 30 to
60 days (National Institute of Studies and Educational Research An√≠sio
Teixeira 2020).
