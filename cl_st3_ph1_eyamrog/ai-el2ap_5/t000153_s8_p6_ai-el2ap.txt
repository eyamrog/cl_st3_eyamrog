The Penal Code of Argentina, in effect since 1921, stipulates
that abortion is not punishable if performed to protect the
life or health of a woman or if the pregnancy
results from rape. Despite these legal provisions, for several decades
the healthcare system has not offered abortion as an accessible
option, effectively resulting in a situation comparable to a total
ban (Bergallo and Michel 2009). Although the causal model could
potentially encompass a significant proportion of abortions currently performed clandestinely,
women and girls who seek non-punishable abortions in public healthcare
institutions are often subjected to coercion and violations of their
privacy. In response to these challenges, recent years have seen
the development of strategies aimed at fostering collaboration between women’s
movement activists and healthcare professionals within public institutions. One of
the most prominent initiatives emerging from these efforts is the
“Red de profesionales de la salud por el derecho a
decidir” (Network of Healthcare Professionals for the Right to Decide,
hereafter referred to as the Network), the outcomes of which
are examined in this research.
