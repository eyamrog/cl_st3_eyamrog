Apposition is typically defined as the relationship between an anchor,
as described by Huddleston and Pullum (2002), and the appositive
expression, with both elements maintaining a form of equivalence (Heringa,
2011). An appositional construction generally consists of two juxtaposed expressions,
most commonly nominal, as illustrated in example (5).
