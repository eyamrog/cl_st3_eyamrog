Labour market instabilities have a direct impact on studentsâ€™ intentions
to pursue higher education. According to a survey conducted by
the Brazilian Association of Higher Education Administrators (2020a) involving 1,607
students from private higher education institutions across all regions of
Brazil, 52% of respondents indicated an intention to continue their
studies after the pandemic, 42% reported uncertainty regarding their educational
plans, 4% planned to withdraw, and 2% confirmed their decision
to discontinue their studies due to the pandemic. Additionally, between
April and May 2020, the rate of default on higher
education tuition payments increased by 75%, highlighting the financial challenges
faced by students who are responsible for fully or partially
funding their education while also managing family obligations (Brazilian Association
of Higher Education Administrators 2020a).
