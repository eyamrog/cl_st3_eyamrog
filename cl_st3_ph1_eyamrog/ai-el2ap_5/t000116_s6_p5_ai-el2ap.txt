This study has several limitations. Conducting impact analyses of public
policies, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, presents specific challenges
due to two main factors. First, although such policies are
intended to reduce inequities, they may initially exacerbate disparities between
social classes. This occurs because newly introduced health interventions are
typically adopted first by the wealthiest segments of the population,
who generally have less need for them. As a result,
absolute health inequalities tend to increase in the short term
and only decrease as the intervention becomes accessible to poorer
sectors of the population, a phenomenon referred to as reverse
equity. However, Guimar√£es (reference 35) found that this effect is
not observed in the context of primary care. Additionally, there
is a lack of longitudinal data that would enable comparisons
over time, as the quality of available data is often
compromised by changes in health management systems.
