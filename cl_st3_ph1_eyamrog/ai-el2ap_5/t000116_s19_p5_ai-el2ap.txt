We subsequently assessed the statistical significance of the observed changes
by analyzing both the step effect (immediate change in outcome
level following the policy) and the ramp effect (change in
trend during the post-policy period), as presented in Table 3.
The results indicate that the most pronounced change in trend
occurred between the baseline period and the implementation of RCAPS.
Specifically, the total hospitalization rate exhibited a significant change in
slope, which was also observed in most diagnostic groups, with
the exceptions of nose, ear and throat infections, lung diseases,
epilepsy, kidney and urinary tract infections, skin infections, and female
pelvic inflammatory disease. Notably, the rate of hospitalizations for diseases
related to childbirth and the puerperium increased, in contrast to
the general reduction observed in other groups. For nutritional deficiencies,
asthma, angina, urinary tract infection, and gastrointestinal ulcers, the primary
change was immediate, as indicated by the step effect. The
transition from RCAPS to PNAB was associated with less pronounced
changes, reaching statistical significance only for asthma, hypertension, epilepsy, and
skin infections (level), as well as angina, epilepsy, and diseases
related to childbirth and the puerperium (slope). Residual analysis, including
goodness-of-fit and Durbin-Watson statistics, confirmed that the models were appropriately
specified.
