Thoropa lutzi is classified as Endangered by the IUCN (2020),
but as Data Deficient in Brazil according to ICMBIO (2018).
This species is currently known only from the states of
Rio de Janeiro and Espírito Santo. No populations have been
observed in Rio de Janeiro, including within PNT, over the
past 30 years (Sabbag et al. 2018). The other three
species, Cycloramphus eleutherodactylus, Vitreorana eurygnatha, and Vitreorana uranoscopa, are listed
as Presumably Threatened only at the state level (Bergallo et
al. 2000), and among them, only C. eleutherodactylus is included
in the IUCN Red List (2020), where it is classified
as Data Deficient. Cycloramphus eleutherodactylus has been reported from the
Brazilian states of Paraná, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and
Minas Gerais (Rossa-Feres et al. 2017; Santos-Pereira et al. 2018),
although some studies have indicated its disappearance from certain areas
by the early 20th century (Izecksohn & Carvalho-e-Silva 2001; Eterovick
et al. 2005). This species was not detected during our
fieldwork and has not been recorded at PNT since 1972
(Matos 2011). However, Lima et al. (2012) reported that C.
eleutherodactylus may be relatively abundant in some cave environments and
highlighted the importance of including such habitats in amphibian surveys.
