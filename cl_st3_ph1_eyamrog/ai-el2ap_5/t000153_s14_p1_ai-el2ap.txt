This exploratory study aims to examine the relationship between abortion
stigma and healthcare professionals who are members of the Network.
By analyzing the accounts of these professionals, the study seeks
to understand how healthcare providers perceive and relate to abortion
stigma in the context of their professional roles, both before
and after joining the Network. Indicators of abortion stigma considered
in this study include negative self-perception regarding their work, fear
of information disclosure, strong social disapproval of their professional activities,
and detachment from colleagues, as identified by Oâ€™Donnell, Weitz, and
Freedman (2011).
