The SÃ¶rensen similarity index (SI) was calculated for the four
sampled sites (Table 4). The results indicate that all four
sites shared at least one species. The highest similarity was
recorded between PM and PB, which is consistent with their
geographic proximity. In contrast, PM and ZR exhibited lower similarity
values, likely due to environmental differences between these sites. The
24 species shared between PM and ZR were also present
at other sites and are generally characterized by their ability
to thrive in disturbed environments, demonstrating considerable ecological plasticity.
