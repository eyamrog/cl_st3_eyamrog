Individualsâ€™ living conditions and economic status significantly influence their psychological
well-being and behavior. Consequently, it is essential to examine the
prevalence and systematic nature of violence and femicide from an
economic perspective, in addition to established feminist, sociological, criminological, human
rights, and decolonial frameworks. Furthermore, analyzing the impact of macroeconomic
factors on violent deaths of women is necessary to inform
the development of monetary and fiscal policies aimed at preventing
future occurrences.
