To support this hypothesis, existing evidence indicates that institutional donors
tend to have a favorable perception of well-managed nonprofit organizations
(e.g., Harris et al., 2015). However, there are also arguments
suggesting that governance may not significantly influence donors' decisions. Donors
often have the ability to directly monitor an organizationâ€™s performance
through the specific projects they support (Lacruz et al., 2019),
or may prioritize factors such as social status (Bekkers and
Wiepking, 2011), which could reduce their reliance on information about
nonprofit governance when making donation decisions. In the Brazilian context,
unlike in North America and Europe, donors may lack access
to information regarding nonprofit governance, leading them to base their
decisions on alternative criteria (Lee, 2016).
