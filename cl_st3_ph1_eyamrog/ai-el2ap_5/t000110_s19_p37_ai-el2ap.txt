This material is similar to Stauroneis schinzii (Brun) Cleve (1894:
146); however, S. schinzii is distinguished by its very broadly
rounded valve apices and larger cell dimensions (Patrick & Reimer
1966: length 130–221 µm, width 17–19 µm, striae 15–18 in
10 µm) compared to Stauroneis sp. 1. In contrast, Stauroneis
sp. 1 is characterized by linear valves with obtusely rounded
subrostrate apices, a broad linear and slightly irregular axial area
that abruptly becomes ovoid at the terminal ends, a relatively
small fascia that slightly expands toward the margin, a broad
raphe that narrows near the proximal and distal ends, branched
distal raphe ends forming semicircular hooks oriented in the same
direction, and radiate striae at the valve center that become
parallel toward the apices. This taxon was present in 35%
of the core samples, with a maximum abundance of 2.6%.
It was identified in samples dating from the end of
the Mid-Holocene to the core top (approximately 5,760 calibrated years
BP to present).
