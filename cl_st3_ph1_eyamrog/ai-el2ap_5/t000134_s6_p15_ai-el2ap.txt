An important unresolved question concerns the original occurrence of the
tortoise Chelonoidis carbonarius in the state of Rio de Janeiro.
The species was first described by Spix (1824) based on
specimens collected from the Amazon River region. Subsequent studies by
Pritchard and Trebbau (1984), Vanzolini (1994), Ernst and Leuteritz (1999),
and Vargas-Ramírez et al. (2010) have documented the geographic distribution
of C. carbonarius in Brazil and specifically noted its absence
from Rio de Janeiro. Although some studies have reported the
presence (e.g., Rocha et al. 2004; Köhler 2008) or possible
occurrence (Tozetti et al. 2017) of C. carbonarius in Rio
de Janeiro, it remains unclear whether this region was part
of the species’ original distribution or whether any observed individuals
are the result of intentional releases of animals previously kept
as pets or for food.
