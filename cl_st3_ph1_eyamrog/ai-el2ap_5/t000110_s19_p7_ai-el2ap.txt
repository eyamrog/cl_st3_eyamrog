This species was identified as Staurosirella cf. acutirostrata (Metzeltin &
Lange-Bertalot) Almeida & Wetzel (2015: 267) based on its less
tapered extremities and shorter valve length (22–36 µm) compared to
the specimens described by Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot (1998: 89, pl.
1, fig. 18–19, pl. 2). It was present in 48%
of all core samples, with a maximum relative abundance of
4.3%. The species was recorded in samples corresponding to the
late Mid-Holocene, from approximately 5,760 calibrated years BP to the
top of the core.
