The most common migration pattern involved married men relocating to
Portugal while their families remained in Brazil, awaiting their return,
although other arrangements also occurred. Regardless of the specific configuration,
the primary objective was to eventually return and reestablish familial
relationships in Valadares. This migration, structured around kinship networks in
Valadares, influenced the daily lives of Brazilians in Portugal. Notable
consequences included a tendency to avoid public visibility, extended working
hours to maximize financial savings, a preference for socializing primarily
with other migrants from Valadares, and an increased likelihood of
participating in Brazilian Protestant religious communities in Portugal.
