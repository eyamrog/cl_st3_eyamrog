This study examined the associations between meta-concerns and symptoms of
anxiety and depression at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic
in Brazil. A total of 2,042 participants, aged 18 to
78 years, completed an online survey that included a sociodemographic
questionnaire, the 4-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and the Meta-Worry Questionnaire.
Four logistic regression models were employed to estimate the effects
of independent variables on anxiety and depression symptoms. The results
indicated that being younger, lacking a steady income, feeling ill,
and reporting a high level of meta-worries were associated with
increased likelihood of exhibiting anxiety and depressive symptoms. These findings
suggest that early identification and intervention for psychological distress are
important in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, as several
susceptibility factors for the development of mental disorders were present
at the beginning of the pandemic in Brazil.
