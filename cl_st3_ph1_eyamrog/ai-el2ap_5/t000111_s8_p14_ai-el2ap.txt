With respect to the data presented above, it is necessary
to analyze the structure of each type of appositive in
relation to distinct derivational processes. The examples in (b) represent
appositive relative clauses, which are generally assumed to involve a
head-raising operation in their derivation (see Kayne, 1994). In contrast,
examples (10) and (11)a do not appear to involve any
relativization process. Therefore, the derivational process for (10)b and (11)b
can be described as follows:
