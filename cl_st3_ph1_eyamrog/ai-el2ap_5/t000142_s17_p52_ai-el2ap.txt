Kapetanios, Shin, and Snell (2006) extended the Engle-Granger Cointegration Test
by adapting it for application to nonlinear models. In their
approach, the null hypothesis posits the absence of a cointegration
relationship between the variables, while the alternative hypothesis asserts the
existence of a nonlinear long-term relationship.
