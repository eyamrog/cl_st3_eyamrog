The pond slider, Trachemys scripta, is native to the southern
United States and northern Mexico; however, since the 1970s, large
numbers have been bred in the United States for the
pet trade, leading to the introduction of this species in
various regions worldwide (e.g., Ramsay et al. 2007; van Dijk
et al. 2011). The occurrence of T. scripta in natural
habitats has been associated with negative impacts on native freshwater
turtle populations (e.g., Cadi & Joly 2004; Hidalgo-Vila et al.
2009). Within the PNT, T. scripta has been observed in
disturbed areas, likely due to the intentional release of individuals
previously kept as pets. However, it remains uncertain whether this
non-native species has established a self-sustaining population in the state
of Rio de Janeiro (Oliveira et al. 2020).
