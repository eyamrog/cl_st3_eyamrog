Furthermore, consistent with the assumptions of Harris et al. (2015)
and Hansan et al. (2016), this study posits that increased
governance is generally beneficial. While acknowledging the importance of governance
as a core responsibility of nonprofit organizations (NPOs), we recommend
that decisions regarding governance activities in NPOs be subjected to
an opportunity cost analysis. In the absence of demonstrable benefits,
governance-related activities such as audit procedures may divert resources away
from the organizationâ€™s primary institutional mission.
