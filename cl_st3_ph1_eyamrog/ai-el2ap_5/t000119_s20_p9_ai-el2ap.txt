Exposure of plant tissues, particularly seeds and roots, to elevated
saline concentrations results in reduced seedling growth, as demonstrated in
our study and supported by Cavalcante et al. (2019). Among
the physiological processes affected, cell growth is notably impaired due
to decreased water uptake. The impact of salinity on the
root system arises from the direct contact of roots with
salts present in the growth medium, which leads to reductions
in both transpiration and growth rates (Guimarães et al. 2013).
Furthermore, salinity impedes the germination process by not only restricting
the rate of water absorption but also by increasing the
influx of potentially toxic ions, such as Na⁺ and Cl⁻,
into the seeds. This accumulation of ions can induce physiological
disorders and, in severe cases, result in plant mortality (Pereira
et al. 2014).
