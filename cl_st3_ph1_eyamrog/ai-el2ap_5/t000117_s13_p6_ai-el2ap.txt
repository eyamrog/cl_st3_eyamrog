Clara Coutinho and Eliana Lisbôa (2011), from the University of
Minho, emphasize in their work "Society of Information, Knowledge, and
Learning: Challenges for Education in the Twenty-First Century" (Sociedade da
Informação, do conhecimento e da aprendizagem: desafios para educação no
século XXI) that the emergence of this new social paradigm
has diminished the constraints of time and space in interpersonal
communication, thereby providing learning opportunities that extend beyond the physical
boundaries of the school environment.
