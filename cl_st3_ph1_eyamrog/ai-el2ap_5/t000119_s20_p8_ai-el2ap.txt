The results of this study are consistent with those reported
by Cavalcante et al. (2019) in rice seeds (Oryza sativa
L.), where root growth was negatively affected by NaCl, particularly
at higher concentrations (up to 0.6 MPa). Similar reductions in
root growth under saline stress were observed by Dalchiavon et
al. (2016) in common bean seeds (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), with
increased salinity leading to impaired root development. Furthermore, Oliveira and
Silva (2019) found that even low concentrations of salt (0.1
MPa) resulted in reduced shoot and root growth, as well
as decreased fresh and dry biomass in common bean seedlings,
indicating that this species exhibits low tolerance to salt stress
induced by KCl.
