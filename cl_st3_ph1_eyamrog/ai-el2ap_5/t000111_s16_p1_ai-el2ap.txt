In a seminal study from 1979, Emonds examines the phenomenon
of relative clauses and asserts that a free relative can
possess appositive content. He argues that it is inconsistent to
conceptualize a free structure—which, by definition, should not be directly
associated with specific syntactic material—as necessarily requiring a connection to
an anchor, such as an antecedent.
