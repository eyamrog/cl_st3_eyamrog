To assess the impact of saline stress on the germination
of common rue seeds (Ruta graveolens L.), aqueous solutions of
sodium chloride (NaCl) and calcium chloride (CaCl2) were prepared at
concentrations corresponding to osmotic potentials of 0 (control, using only
distilled water), -0.10, -0.20, -0.30, and -0.40 MPa. The volumes
of NaCl and CaCl2 solutions required to achieve the desired
osmotic potentials were calculated using the Van't Hoff equation, as
described by Braccini et al. (1996) and Taiz and Zeiger
(2013).
