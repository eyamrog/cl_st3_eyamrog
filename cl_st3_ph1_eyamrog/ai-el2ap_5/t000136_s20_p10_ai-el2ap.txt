The Board serves as the collective decision-making body responsible for
maintaining the strategic direction of the NPO. Specifically, it defines
guidelines that support the NPO’s practices and operations, and its
primary function is to establish a connection between the organization’s
mission and its management, as noted by Fama and Jensen
(1983), Jensen (1993), and Jensen and Meckling (1995). In operational
terms, the construct of the Board encompasses elements related to
its composition (such as election procedures, mandate, independence, and committees)
as well as its responsibilities (including the approval of the
CEO’s compensation and the Annual Report).
