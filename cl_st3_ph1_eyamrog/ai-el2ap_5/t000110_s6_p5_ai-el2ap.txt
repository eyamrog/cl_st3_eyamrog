An additional 14 species were distributed throughout the core without
clear spatial differentiation, collectively reaching a maximum abundance of 75.3%.
The observed variation in diatom species composition suggests fluctuations in
water levels of the Xingu River, indicating that the system
was characterized by deeper waters at the end of the
Mid-Holocene, which transitioned to shallower conditions during the Late Holocene.
