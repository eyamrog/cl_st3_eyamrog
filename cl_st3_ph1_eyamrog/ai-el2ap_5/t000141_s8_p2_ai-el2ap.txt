In Brazil, the high rate and rapid spread of COVID-19
necessitated the implementation of restrictive measures across both public and
private sectors nationwide, with only essential activities maintained and adherence
to public health recommendations and social distancing guidelines from the
World Health Organization. These measures demonstrated that addressing the COVID-19
pandemic involves not only health-related factors but also social, political,
and economic considerations. In this context, coordinated and collaborative actions
among Brazilian federative units—comprising the states and the Federal District—in
accordance with the guidelines of relevant authorities and informed by
international experiences, are critical, as delayed or inadequate governmental responses
can place significant strain on public health systems and result
in substantial loss of life.
