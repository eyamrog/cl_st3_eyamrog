The indicators identified in the study’s documentary database were classified
as either simple or composite, with composite indicators defined as
the aggregation of two or more simple indicators.(42) Among the
normative frameworks analyzed, eight states employed composite indicators: Espírito Santo,
Pará, Piauí, Rio Grande do Sul, and São Paulo each
utilized two composite indicators; Alagoas and Acre used three; and
Santa Catarina employed four. The most frequently used composite criteria
pertained to the extent of disease transmission and the capacity
of the state health system to respond.
