In addition to the core components of giftedness, talent, and
the Development Process, the Differentiating Model of Giftedness and Talent
(DMGT) includes two additional constructs: intrapersonal and environmental catalysts, which
function as facilitators within the developmental process (Gagné, 2013a). Although
these constructs are theoretically distinct, they are interrelated and interdependent,
as they collectively contribute to the progressive transformation of giftedness
into talent (Gagné, 2013b). Gagné (2013a) notes that it is
not possible to establish entirely separate measures for these constructs,
as they exist along a continuum within a broader dynamic
process. Importantly, giftedness is a necessary precondition for the emergence
of talent. Consequently, the timely identification and support of individuals
with giftedness and talent in specialized educational settings (AEE rooms)
are essential for the effective development of their talents.
