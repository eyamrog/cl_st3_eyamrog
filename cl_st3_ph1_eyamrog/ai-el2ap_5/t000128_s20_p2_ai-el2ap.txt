Regarding the results obtained with the L. ferrea extract (Table
2), the strains of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Klebsiella
pneumoniae did not exhibit significant inhibition zones. However, the decoction,
when applied at concentrations of 100, 50, 25, and 12.5
mg/mL, inhibited the growth of E. faecalis strains, with the
highest concentration demonstrating an effect comparable to the positive control.
These findings may be attributed to the simpler cell wall
structure of Gram-positive bacteria, such as E. faecalis, compared to
Gram-negative bacteria. Overall, the results indicate that the decoction method
for preparing L. ferrea extract is effective and straightforward, with
potential to reduce the presence of these microorganisms on the
surfaces of tools.
