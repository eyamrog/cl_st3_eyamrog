The present study has several limitations. The sample is not
directly generalizable due to its non-randomized selection; however, the relatively
large sample size contributes to the reliability of the findings
and enhances the potential for replicability. The data were collected
primarily in the Brazilian Northeast and predominantly from groups with
specific demographic characteristics, namely women with a high level of
education. Additionally, while meta-worry was examined as an explanatory variable,
other potentially relevant mediators, such as anxiety tolerance and coping
strategies, were not assessed. This omission precludes analysis of whether
these variables might mitigate the likelihood of group membership associated
with high levels of worry. Future research should incorporate these
mediators to more comprehensively evaluate the predictive role of meta-worry
in anxiety and depression. Furthermore, given the evolving phases of
social isolation and the ongoing consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic,
longitudinal studies are warranted to monitor the impact on mental
health during and after the pandemic.
