Leaves are rigid, imbricate when dry, and erect when moist,
with a lanceolate-linear and acuminate shape. The species is characterized
by pyriform and smooth apical lamella cells. Peralta and Yano
(2010) identified this plant as the largest species within the
family. It is terricolous, occurring in montane Atlantic Forest and
Pampa habitats, and has been recorded in the Brazilian states
of Bahia, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Paraná, Rio de Janeiro,
Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and São Paulo. The
species is endemic to Brazil.
