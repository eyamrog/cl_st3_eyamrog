It is important to note that the majority of the
Brazilian population resides in urban areas. Brazil comprises more than
5,000 municipalities, most of which are small cities or towns
where internet transmission signals are often inadequate due to factors
such as distance from major urban centers, where optical fiber
infrastructure is more readily available, and limited radio transmission, which
is sometimes absent in rural areas. Furthermore, residing in urban
centers does not guarantee access to broadband internet, as service
quality can be unstable, particularly in peripheral regions. According to
Lis (2020) and Yuge (2020), the National Telecommunications Agency has
reported an increasing number of complaints regarding insufficient broadband internet
provision in Brazil. Cardoso (2020) highlights the challenges of accessing
broadband internet in the outskirts of São Paulo, the largest
urban center in the country’s most economically developed region, where,
according to the SEADE Foundation (2020), more than 7.5 million
people have never had internet access. Soprana (2020) further indicates
that over 70 million Brazilians lack internet access.
