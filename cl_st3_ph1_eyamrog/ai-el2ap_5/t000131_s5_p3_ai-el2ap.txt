Differences in total chlorophyll content, carotenoid levels, and the carotenoid/chlorophyll
ratio have been documented between sun- and shade-adapted leaves in
various species (Demmig-Adams 1998; Lichtenthaler & Babani 2004; Lichtenthaler et
al. 2007). The increased accumulation of chlorophyll observed in Mikania
plants grown under shade conditions is considered a compensatory response
to enhance light capture (Almeida et al. 2005). Chlorophyll undergoes
continuous synthesis and degradation (photo-oxidation) in the presence of light;
under high light intensity, the rate of photo-oxidation increases, and
a steady-state balance is achieved at lower irradiation levels (Kramer
& Kozlowski 1979). Reductions in chlorophyll content and Fv/Fm values
serve as indicators of oxidative stress, as observed in plants
developed under I0. In contrast, in M. laevigata grown under
I25 and I50, the lower chlorophyll content compared to M.
glomerata may contribute to photoprotection by reducing light interception, which
is associated with higher Fv/Fm values in this species (Munn√©-Bosch
& Alegra 2000).
