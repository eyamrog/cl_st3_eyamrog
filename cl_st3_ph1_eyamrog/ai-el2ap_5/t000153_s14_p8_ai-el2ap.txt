The pioneering work of sociologist Erving Goffman systematically examined the
processes by which certain personal attributes are symbolically translated and
categorized to establish a “social identity.” Goffman’s research demonstrates that
an attribute may become a stigma when it is questioned
or highlighted in a particular context, defining stigma as a
mark or fault associated with individuals who are considered “uncommon”
or who possess an “undesired difference” (Goffman 2008). According to
Goffman, the origin of such discredit arises from a discrepancy
between the “virtual social identity”—the identity ascribed to an individual
by society—and the “real social identity”—the attributes the individual actually
possesses—relative to the expectations prevailing in a given context. He
notes that “not all undesirable attributes are at issue, but
only those which are incongruous with our stereotype of what
a given type of individual should be” (Goffman 2006, p.
132). While Goffman characterizes stigma as an attribute that is
deeply discrediting for those affected, he also asserts that “an
attribute that stigmatizes one type of possessor can confirm the
usualness of another,” indicating that the attribute itself is neither
inherently creditable nor discreditable (Goffman 2006, p. 132). Thus, discredit
is context-dependent, identifying a particular aspect of an individual as
problematic according to the prevailing norms of a specific society.
Furthermore, Goffman distinguishes between two perspectives: when a stigmatized individual
believes their difference is already known or visible, they are
considered discredited; conversely, if the individual assumes their difference is
not known or immediately perceptible, they are considered discreditable, and
in this case, the stigmatized attribute may be concealed from
others (Goffman 2006).
