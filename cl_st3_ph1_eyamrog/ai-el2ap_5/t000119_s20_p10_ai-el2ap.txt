The results of this study indicate that higher saline concentrations
in the substrate significantly reduced seed germination and initial growth
of common rue seedlings. Calcium chloride (CaCl2) exerted a more
pronounced inhibitory effect on seedling growth compared to sodium chloride
(NaCl). These findings are consistent with those of Souza and
Cardoso (2000), who reported that chemical differences between saline solutions
can lead to variations in germination and seedling vigor, even
when water potentials are comparable.
