It should be noted, however, that in example (24), quem
is associated with a nominal antecedent. A closer examination of
this sentence reveals that the lexical item quem functions as
a standard relative pronoun in this context, as demonstrated in
(28) below, where quem can be readily replaced by the
relative pronouns que or a qual (see Macambira, 1998; Medeiros
Junior, 2006).
