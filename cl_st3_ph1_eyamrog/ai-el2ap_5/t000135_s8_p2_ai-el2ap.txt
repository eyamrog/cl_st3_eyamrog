The Unified Health System (SUS) in Brazil provides healthcare coverage
for approximately 75% of the population, while the supplementary health
care system serves the remaining 25%. During the COVID-19 pandemic,
the SUS was expected to manage the increasing number of
COVID-19 cases in addition to maintaining care for other acute
and chronic conditions. However, the pandemic has highlighted persistent deficiencies
in Brazilâ€™s healthcare networks, including fragmentation, inadequate infrastructure, insufficient coordination
among different levels of care, and chronic underfunding.
