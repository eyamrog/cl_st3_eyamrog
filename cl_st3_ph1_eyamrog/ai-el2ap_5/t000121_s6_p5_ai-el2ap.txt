The main explanatory variable identified in this study was meta-worry,
which substantially increased the likelihood of experiencing symptoms in both
assessed outcomes, with individuals exhibiting nearly 13 times higher odds
of presenting symptoms of anxiety and depression simultaneously. Meta-worry appears
to be a significant factor in the manifestation of anxious
symptoms, particularly in the context of the current pandemic, which
is characterized by heightened concerns such as fear of contagion,
mortality, and the well-being of loved ones, as well as
the effects of social isolation (Liu et al., 2020). Evidence
indicates that symptoms of anxiety and depression are prevalent in
situations involving excessive meta-worry (Topper et al., 2017), and existing
research demonstrates increased vulnerability to these conditions among individuals who
frequently engage in pandemic-related cognitions (Huang & Zhao, 2020). Furthermore,
during epidemics, the proportion of individuals experiencing mental health issues
often exceeds the number of those directly affected by the
disease and these psychological effects may persist beyond the duration
of the epidemic itself (Shigemura, Ursano, Morganstein, Kurosawa, & Benedek,
2020), highlighting the relevance of addressing excessive worrying in the
Brazilian context.
