Access to higher education in Brazil has historically been restricted
to a privileged segment of the population. Although policy reforms
have been implemented, equitable access to higher education remains limited.
Public higher education institutions (HEIs) face constraints due to insufficient
capacity, while private HEIs impose barriers through high tuition fees.
State-funded public policies aimed at improving accessibility and retention are
undermined by reductions in various forms of student financial support.
Additionally, limited purchasing power for technological resources and inadequate internet
access, both of which are essential for the continuation of
academic activities in synchronous, asynchronous, or hybrid formats, further exacerbate
these challenges.
