The temporality of projects suggests that governance in non-profit organizations
(NPOs) is significantly shaped by the characteristics and requirements of
individual projects. Each project, with its unique features, contributes to
the development of governance practices at the organizational level (Lacruz
et al., 2019). The process of marketization (Salamon, 1997) further
enables NPOs to integrate both essential governance elements and those
mandated by donors for the duration of a project. However,
these governance mechanisms are typically discontinued at the conclusion of
a project, and subsequent projects may either adopt or modify
them in response to the specific requirements of new donors
(Lacruz et al., 2019). While the findings of this study
do not provide definitive evidence, the overall discussion supports the
plausibility of this proposition.
