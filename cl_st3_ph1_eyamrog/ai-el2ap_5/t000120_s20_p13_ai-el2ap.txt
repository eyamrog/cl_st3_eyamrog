The AMF species richness in the control group (p =
0.91) and the percentage of organic matter in both the
control (p = 0.32) and treatment groups (p = 0.81)
did not exhibit significant differences between sampling periods (Figure 1).
Previous research in forest areas at different successional stages in
the municipality of Alc√¢ntara, MA, indicates that the high diversity
of niches and opportunities in severely degraded areas may contribute
to greater AMF species richness at the onset of plant
succession (Reyes et al. 2019). The observed reduction in AMF
richness over time in the treatment group may be associated
with decreased fungal niche competition, increased population stability, and the
predominance of k-strategist species, which are characterized by lower sporulation
rates and enhanced competitive survival, as reported by Pereira et
al. (2014). Additionally, the quantity of litter added to the
treatment plots was insufficient to produce a significant difference in
the total percentage of organic matter between samples.
