Of the species identified, 70.67% were native and 29.33% were
exotic (Fig. 2a). Exotic species were predominantly observed in areas
subject to higher levels of disturbance, such as tracks, roadsides,
fencelines, and power lines. These locations experience frequent vehicular traffic,
including trucks and agricultural machinery originating from regions outside the
Middle Valley, which serve as vectors for the introduction of
seeds and other propagules of exotic species. Additionally, disturbances resulting
from activities such as fence maintenance and vegetation clearing alter
the structure and composition of plant communities. This pattern, documented
by Peralta et al. (unpublished) in two agricultural establishments in
the Middle Valley, is consistent throughout the study area.
