vt represents a stationary process with a mean of zero.
Therefore, the initial value of Y in Model A is
stationary around a mean that gradually shifts from α1 to
α1+α2. Similarly, in Model B, the mean also transitions gradually
between α1 and α1+α2; however, Model B includes an additional
constant trend term, distinguishing it from Model A. In Model
C, the constant term transitions from α1 to α1+α2, while
the trend term shifts from β1 to β1+β2, both occurring
gradually, simultaneously, and at the same rate. In this test,
it is assumed that the transitions in both the constant
and trend terms occur concurrently and at an identical speed.
