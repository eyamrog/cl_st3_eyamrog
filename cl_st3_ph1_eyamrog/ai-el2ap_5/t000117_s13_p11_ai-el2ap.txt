In the report organized by Edgard Faure (1973), the epilogue
to the second part, titled "In the manner of a
presage – An Educational City," conceptualizes education as an advent
and employs the term "presage" to frame its discussion. The
authors use this term to articulate at least four interpretations
of education and what is considered "educational": as something external
to individuals and thus belonging to the realm of the
currently unthinkable; as something that is yet to materialize and
therefore not yet feasible; and as something imminent that has
the potential to transform existing educational practices into improved forms
in the foreseeable future. This perspective, which views education as
perpetually forthcoming and associates it with a transcendental notion of
educational space, closely parallels contemporary discussions about educational cities and
educational spaces that extend beyond traditional school environments—these, too, are
conceptualized as developments that are yet to be realized. Consequently,
the education of the future is depicted as emerging from
present conditions, with the potential to offer significant advancements for
humanity once it is actualized.
