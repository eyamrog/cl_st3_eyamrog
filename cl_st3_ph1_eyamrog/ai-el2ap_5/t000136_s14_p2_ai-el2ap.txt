We selected non-profit organizations (NPOs) operating in the environmental sector
in Brazil as the units of analysis. By restricting the
study to a specific area of activity and a defined
geographic scope, we aimed to enhance the homogeneity of the
units of analysis across all selected NPOs. Additionally, the significance
of the social objectives pursued by environmental NPOs further justifies
this choice.
