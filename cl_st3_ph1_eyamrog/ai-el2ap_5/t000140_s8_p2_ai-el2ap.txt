By the second decade of the twenty-first century, while secure,
bound paper coursepacks continued to be sold to students, scholarly
publishing had largely transitioned to cloud-based online access facilitated by
institutional licenses through university libraries, alongside a small but increasing
proportion of open access materials. This digital transformation has accentuated
the distinctions between scholarly publishing, which is embedded in the
sponsored economy of academia, and trade publishing, which operates as
a commercial enterprise (Willinsky, 2017). Historically, scholarly authors have been
compensated through university employment, supported in part by student tuition,
with their scholarly publications contributing to their professional advancement. In
contrast, trade authors primarily derive income from the sale of
their books and the placement of their work in commercial
media outlets. In the digital era, scholarly journals and many
scholarly books have become available online, with libraries acquiring institutional
licenses that provide access to the entire university community, surpassing
the limitations of single-copy print resources. Additionally, an increasing, though
still limited, proportion of journals and books are published or
deposited in open access repositories. By 2017, this shift had
resulted in nearly one-third of research journal literature being freely
available, with a smaller but growing share of scholarly books
also accessible through open access channels (Piwowar et al., 2018).
