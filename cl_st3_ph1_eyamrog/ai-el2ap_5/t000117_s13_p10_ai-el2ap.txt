The International Commission for the Development of Education for UNESCO,
chaired by former French minister Edgar Faure, produced the report
"Learn to Be: The Education of the Future" in 1973.
Developed in collaboration with multiple authors, the report provided an
overview of global education at the time and addressed the
challenges posed by contemporary scientific and technological advancements. Key concepts
introduced in this report, such as "learn to be," "educational
city," and "continuous and permanent education," were later revisited in
a subsequent UNESCO report organized by Jacques Delors and published
in 1996 under the title "Learning: The Treasure Within," nearly
three decades after the Faure report.
