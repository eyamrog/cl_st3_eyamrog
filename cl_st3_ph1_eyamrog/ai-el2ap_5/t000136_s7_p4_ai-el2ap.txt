Governance is a multifaceted concept, and there are theoretical justifications
for treating it as a construct, as its characterization as
a latent variable more accurately reflects the theoretical definitions underlying
its conceptualization (Larcker et al., 2007; Harris et al., 2015).
Accordingly, in this study, governance is modeled as a second-order
construct comprising multiple governance dimensions (first-order constructs), each of which
is measured by specific governance factors (manifest variables).
