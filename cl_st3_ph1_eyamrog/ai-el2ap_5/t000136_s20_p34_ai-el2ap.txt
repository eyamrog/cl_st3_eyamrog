This result contrasts with the findings of Feng, Neely, and
Slatten (2016), who reported that the Standards for ExcellenceÂ® certification
was associated with an increase in donations compared to a
control group of nonprofit organizations (NPOs) that did not receive
the certification. It is important to note that this certification
is administered by the Maryland Association of Nonprofit Organizations and
involves more rigorous requirements than the other certifications examined in
this study (OS, OSCIP, and CEBAS). Additionally, the present result
does not align with the findings of Desai and Yetman
(2015), who observed that legal and reporting requirements for NPOs
moderated the relationship between changes in charitable spending and changes
in program revenues. These previous studies suggest that state regulation,
through enhanced certification requirements, may facilitate the ability of NPOs
to fulfill their social roles. Conversely, Lee (2016), using data
from the National Center for Charitable Statistics, found that state
regulation does not influence the adoption of good governance policies
by NPOs; organizations operating in states with reporting and registration
requirements were not more likely to adopt accountability policies than
those in states without such requirements.
