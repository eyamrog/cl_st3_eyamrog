In the second part of this report, the guiding principles
for education are presented as the "four pillars of education,"
which are based on the work of Faure and colleagues
(1973), particularly their perspectives on educational requirements in the context
of globalization and the emergence of new information and communication
technologies. These four pillars are defined as "learning to know,"
"learning to do," "learning to live together," and "learning to
be." "Learning to know" refers to the acquisition of cognitive
tools necessary for understanding (Delors et al., 1998, p. 90);
"learning to do" pertains to the development of skills that
enable individuals to act effectively in the world (Delors et
al., 1998, p. 90); "learning to live together" involves the
ability to participate and cooperate with others across various human
activities (Delors et al., 1998, p. 90); and "learning to
be" is conceived as an integrative pillar that encompasses and
synthesizes the previous three.
