Equation (1) specifies the model as follows: \( y_t =
\beta_0 + \beta_1 y_{t-1} + \beta_2 y_{t-1}^2 + \beta_3 y_{t-1}^3
+ \beta_4 \Delta y_{t-1} + \beta_5 (\Delta y_{t-1})^2 + \beta_6
(\Delta y_{t-1})^3 + \varepsilon_t \), where \( y_t \) denotes
the dependent variable at time \( t \), \( y_{t-1}
\) is its lagged value, and \( \Delta y_{t-1} \)
represents the first difference of \( y_{t-1} \). The parameters
\( \beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3, \beta_4, \beta_5, \) and \(
\beta_6 \) are coefficients to be estimated, and \( \varepsilon_t
\) is the error term. This specification allows for the
inclusion of both linear and nonlinear dynamics in the lagged
levels and differences of the dependent variable.
