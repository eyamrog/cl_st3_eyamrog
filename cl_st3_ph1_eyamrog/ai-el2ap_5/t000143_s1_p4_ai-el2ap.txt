Conclusions: This study is the first to analyze the factors
associated with spatial clusters of feminicide rates in a geographical
context characterized by a predominance of patriarchal culture. The findings
indicate an increase in feminicide rates in areas with lower
social inequality, higher human development, and greater authority exercised by
women within the family environment.
