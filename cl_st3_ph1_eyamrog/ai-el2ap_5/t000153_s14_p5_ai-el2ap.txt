Currently, there is a lack of qualitative research at the
regional level that provides insight into effective strategies for reducing
abortion-related stigma. In response, the present study aims to address
this gap by examining changes in professionals’ perceptions of stigma
after joining the Network, based on their own perspectives. This
article seeks to demonstrate that adopting an active professional role
and advocating for one’s work can serve as mechanisms for
resisting and reducing the stigma associated with abortion within the
professional context.
