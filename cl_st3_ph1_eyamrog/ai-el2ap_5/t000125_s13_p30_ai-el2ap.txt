As shown in Table 3, in 2018 São Paulo State
University (UNESP) maintained a clear lead, despite its score decreasing
from 2.81 points in 2017 to 2.49 points in 2018.
UNESP continued to hold a significant advantage over the second-ranked
institution, the Federal University of Mato Grosso, which achieved an
average Dimensions score of 1.57 points, representing a marginal increase
of 0.01 points compared to its 2017 result. All other
universities remained below the 1.0-point threshold, with minimal variation among
them; the difference between the third and last positions was
only 0.29 points. UNESP led in all Dimensions, particularly in
“Teaching and Learning,” where it scored 3.25 points—a Dimension for
which only UNESP and the Federal University of Mato Grosso
(2.00 points) reported data, as was the case in 2017.
In “Regional Engagement,” UNESP’s score declined substantially from 4.00 in
2017 to 2.50 in 2018, while the Federal University of
Mato Grosso increased its score from 1.17 to 1.33. This
change is the primary factor contributing to the reduced gap
between the top two Brazilian universities.
