In this study, the governance construct was limited to internal
mechanisms. External mechanisms, specifically the Market of Products and Factors
and the Political, Legal, and Regulatory System, were used to
define the scope of the empirical investigation, functioning similarly to
control variables. The primary focus of the research was on
the Donations Market, specifically examining the impact of governance on
donations with donor restrictions. Additionally, a specific aspect of the
political, legal, and regulatory system—namely, NPO certification—was included to assess
its potential moderating effect on the relationship between governance and
donations. Consequently, the study investigated a comprehensive set of governance
dimensions.
