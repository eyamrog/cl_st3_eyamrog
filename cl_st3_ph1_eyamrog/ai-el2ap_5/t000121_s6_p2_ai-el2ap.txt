With respect to age, the data indicate that younger individuals
exhibited a higher likelihood of presenting symptoms across all measured
outcomes. In all evaluated models, participants aged 24 years or
younger demonstrated greater vulnerability to anxious and/or depressive symptoms at
the time of data collection. This increased vulnerability among younger
individuals may be partially explained by their generally lower levels
of experience in managing various psychosocial stressors compared to older
adults, with some of these stressors being exacerbated during the
current pandemic. For instance, younger individuals are more likely to
be at the early stages of their professional careers and
may not yet have achieved financial stability, which increases the
probability of lacking a steady or regular income (Huang &
Zhao, 2020; Liu, Zhang, Wong, & Hyum, 2020). Notably, the
presence of a steady income was associated with all outcomes
except for depression when considered in isolation. It is important
to highlight that these findings were obtained approximately two months
after the implementation of quarantine and social distancing measures, a
period during which concerns related to unemployment and income instability
were already prevalent and widely recognized within society.
