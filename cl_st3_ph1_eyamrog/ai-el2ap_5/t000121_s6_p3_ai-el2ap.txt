Another important variable was health perception. The results indicated that
individuals who perceived themselves as ill had a higher likelihood
of exhibiting symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. Specifically, participants with
a pre-existing health issue or vulnerability were, on average, twice
as likely to develop symptoms of anxiety or depression. Given
the daily stress associated with the pandemic, to which participants
had already been exposed for two months at the onset
of confinement, those reporting a deteriorated perception of their health
may have had an increased vulnerability. Consistent with these findings,
previous studies have also reported that poor health perception is
associated with higher rates of depression and anxiety during the
COVID-19 pandemic (Wang et al., 2020), particularly when the perception
of illness is linked to suspected coronavirus infection (Nguyen et
al., 2020), thereby supporting the alignment of the present results
with existing evidence.
