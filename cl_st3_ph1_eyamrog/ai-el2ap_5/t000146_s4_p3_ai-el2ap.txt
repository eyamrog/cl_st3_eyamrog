The analysis of citation patterns based on the native language
of the authorâ€™s country indicated a linear relationship between the
proportion of publications in the native language and their corresponding
impact. Brazil and the United States produce the lowest proportion
of research in their respective native languages and demonstrate a
greater reach in other languages. In contrast, Colombia, Cuba, Spain,
and Peru publish a higher proportion of research in their
native language, resulting in an impact that is primarily concentrated
within the Spanish-speaking community. Additionally, it was observed that Spain
and the United States exhibit their lowest citation impact within
the SciELO database, suggesting that their citations are predominantly sourced
from outside the SciELO CI domain. Conversely, the Latin American
countries examined display a notable level of impact in this
research area, achieving approximately two-thirds of the citation impact observed
on the Web of Science platform.
