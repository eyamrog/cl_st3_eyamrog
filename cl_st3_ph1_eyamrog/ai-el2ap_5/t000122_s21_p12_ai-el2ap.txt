The data obtained in this study enabled the identification of
effective procedures for the removal of contaminating organisms from B.
binderi. Immersion of thalli in 5% liquid detergent followed by
1% povidone iodine was not effective, whereas immersion in 5%
liquid detergent followed by 0.2% sodium hypochlorite was effective. Relative
growth rates (RGRs) of thalli immersed in sodium hypochlorite for
5 minutes were significantly different from those immersed for 2
minutes and from the control, while RGRs of thalli immersed
for 2 minutes did not differ from the control. Therefore,
a 2-minute immersion is recommended to minimize exposure of the
macroalgae to sodium hypochlorite. Physical removal of remaining annelids should
be performed using sterilized tweezers under stereoscopic and optical microscopes.
The complete protocol for surface decontamination of B. binderi is
presented in Table 2.
