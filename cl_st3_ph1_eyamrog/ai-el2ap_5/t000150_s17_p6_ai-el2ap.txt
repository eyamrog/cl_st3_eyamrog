The experiences of individuals from Valadares, Portugal, contrast with those
of Brazilians living in Porto. While Brazilians in Porto often
emphasize their national identity to access labor market opportunities that
value Brazilianness, individuals from Valadares tend to conceal any association
with Brazilianness in order to avoid jeopardizing their original migration
objectives.
