The non-linearity observed in the relationship with the representativeness of
the SciELO CI domain appears to be partially attributable to
the countries included in this domain (Fig. 2-B), specifically Brazil,
the USA, and Spain. Brazil contributes the largest number of
journals and exerts a relatively significant influence on SciELO CI,
despite not publishing a proportionate percentage of its output in
its own language, unlike countries such as Colombia, Cuba, and
Peru. As previously noted, this domain is not significant for
the USA. In the case of Spain, the limited representation
is primarily due to factors related to research production rather
than research impact. It is important to note that SciELO
CI is a widely recognized database suitable for analyzing the
research impact of Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries in
the field of Public and Collective Health. Additionally, all LAC
countries demonstrate some degree of impact within the broader context
of the Web of Science (WoS) platform.
