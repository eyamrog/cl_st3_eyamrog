In the bivariate analysis (Table 1), the percentage of unemployed
individuals and the percentage of female-headed households were both found
to have statistically significant positive correlations with femicide rates (p
< 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). Additionally, there was
a statistically significant negative correlation between the proportion of the
population earning less than half the minimum wage and femicide
rates (p < 0.05).
