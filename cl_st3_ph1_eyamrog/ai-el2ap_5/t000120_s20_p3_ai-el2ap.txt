Physico-chemical analysis of integrated soil samples indicated that particle size
distribution in the first sample classified the soil as sandy
clay, with a higher proportion of clay observed in the
deeper layers. According to the Brazilian Soil Classification System, as
described by Dos Santos et al. (2018), this profile corresponds
to the "argissolo" category.
