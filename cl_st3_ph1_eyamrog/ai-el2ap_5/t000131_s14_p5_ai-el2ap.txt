Photosynthetic pigments were extracted and quantified according to the method
described by Hendry and Price (1993). Leaf discs weighing 0.1
g were homogenized in 80% acetone, and the absorbance of
the resulting extracts was measured at wavelengths of 480, 645,
and 663 nm using a Genesys 5 Spectronic spectrophotometer. The
concentrations of total chlorophyll and carotenoids were calculated based on
the recorded absorbance values.
