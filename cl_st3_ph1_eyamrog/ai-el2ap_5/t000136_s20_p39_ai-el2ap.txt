The identified relationships can be linked to the process of
marketization as described by Salamon (1997) and supported by the
findings of Lacruz et al. (2019). In response to constraints
in the donations market, non-profit organizations (NPOs) have increasingly adopted
approaches characteristic of private-for-profit markets, a phenomenon Salamon (1997) refers
to as the marketization of the non-profit private sector. As
a result, NPOs have expanded their external accountability and are
now required to demonstrate outcomes related to efficiency and effectiveness
(Arvidson and Lyon, 2014), in addition to implementing management models
designed to achieve these objectives (Smith, 2010).
