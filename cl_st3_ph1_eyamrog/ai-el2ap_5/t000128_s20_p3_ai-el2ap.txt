The decoction did not inhibit the growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Salmonella Typhimurium. These bacteria are
Gram-negative and possess an outer membrane in their cell wall
structure, which is composed of lipids and lipopolysaccharides (Tortora, Funke,
& Case, 2012). This outer membrane may act as a
barrier that limits the penetration of hydrophilic compounds present in
the decoction.
