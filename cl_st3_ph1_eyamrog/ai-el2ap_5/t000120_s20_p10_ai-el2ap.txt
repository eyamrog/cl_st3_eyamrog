The species Dentiscutata erythropus, Dentiscutata reticulata, Glomus aggregatum, Glomus heterosporum,
Glomus macrocarpum, Funneliformis geosporum, and Archaeospora trappei have been recorded
on four or more continents and are therefore classified as
cosmopolitan in their distribution (St√ºrmer et al. 2018).
