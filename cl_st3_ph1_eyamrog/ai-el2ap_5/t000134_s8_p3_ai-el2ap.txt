In addition to the PNT, two other large parks are
located within the urban area of Rio de Janeiro: the
Parque Estadual da Pedra Branca and the Parque Natural Municipal
da Serra do Mendanha (PNM Serra do Mendanha). The PNT
has a well-documented history of scientific research, with naturalists visiting
the area as early as the 19th and 20th centuries.
These early studies resulted in the description of several amphibian
species based on specimens collected in the region, including Aplastodiscus
albofrenatus (Lutz, 1924), Dendrophryniscus brevipollicatus Jiménez de la Espada 1870,
Ischnocnema guentheri (Steindachner, 1864), Ischnocnema octavioi (Bokermann, 1965), Phasmahyla guttata
(Lutz, 1924), and Scinax trapicheiroi (A. Lutz and B. Lutz,
1954). More recent herpetofaunal research in the park has focused
on the ecology, natural history, and bioacoustics of selected taxa
(e.g., Heyer 1973; Hepp & Carvalho-e-Silva 2011; Dorigo et al.
2014; Machado et al. 2016; Hepp et al. 2017; Silva-e-Souza
2019; Guarabyra et al. 2020). Preliminary lists of amphibian (Carvalho-e-Silva
et al. 2008) and reptile species (Mocelin 2008) were compiled
for the park’s management plan (ICMBIO 2008); however, to date,
no comprehensive systematic inventory has been conducted. To address this
gap, we conducted a three-year inventory of the herpetofauna of
the PNT, employing intensive sampling to determine species composition and
to estimate the richness and abundance of amphibians and reptiles
in the park. This inventory was supplemented with occurrence records
from herpetological collections and species reintroduction programs within the PNT.
