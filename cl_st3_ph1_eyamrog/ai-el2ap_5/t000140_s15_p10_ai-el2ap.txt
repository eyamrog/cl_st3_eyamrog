A little more than a quarter of the syllabuses, specifically
27.2 percent (923 syllabuses), assigned readings to students as part
of their coursework (Table 3a). The legal dispute referenced earlier
concerns the payment of licensing fees for the use of
these readings. Of the four types of readings analyzed, journal
articles constituted the largest category. A total of 7,961 journal
articles were assigned across 707 syllabuses, representing 20.8 percent of
all syllabuses, with an average of 11.3 articles per syllabus
that included journal articles (Table 3b). Scholarly book chapters were
assigned in similar proportions, appearing on 702 syllabuses (20.7 percent),
with a total of 4,906 chapters assigned and an average
of 7.0 chapters per syllabus that included this type of
reading.
