As discussed in section 1.3, the appositive in (52) is
a standard CP—referred to here as a DP-like CP—that is
directly selected by the matrix verb and juxtaposed to the
nominal anchor “uma só coisa.” This observation raises the possibility
that the Wh-sentence in (47) may also be juxtaposed to
the nominal “Um fã teu.” In contrast, ordinary appositive relative
clauses are expected to behave differently; specifically, an appositive relative
clause cannot be juxtaposed to its anchor because the anchor
is the nominal being relativized, which has been raised from
within the relative clause (see Kayne, 1994; Bianchi, 1999).
