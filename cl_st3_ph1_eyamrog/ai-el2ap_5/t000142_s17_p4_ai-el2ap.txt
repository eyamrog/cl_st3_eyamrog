Linearity tests are based on models employing smooth transition autoregressive
(STAR) frameworks. These tests serve as preliminary assessments for determining
the appropriateness of STAR-type models. Unlike other linearity tests, those
introduced by Harvey do not require any specific preconditions. Given
their primary advantage of being unaffected by the stationarity properties
of the data, the tests developed by Harvey and Leybourne
(2007) and Harvey, Leybourne, and Xiao (2008) were utilized to
assess linearity in this study.
