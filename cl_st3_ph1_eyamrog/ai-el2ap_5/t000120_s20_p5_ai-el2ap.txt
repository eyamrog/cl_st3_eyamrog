The second sample contained less organic matter than the first,
indicating that decomposition of organic material likely occurred, despite the
addition of serapillera to the treated plots. Phosphorus content decreased
by 3 mg dm⁻³ between samples. This reduction may be
associated with the presence of U. brizantha in the soil,
as this species is an effective host for arbuscular mycorrhizal
fungi (AMF) and exhibits both a high photosynthetic rate and
a substantial phosphorus requirement during its early developmental stages (Smith
& Gianinazzi-Pearson 1988; Carrenho et al. 2010). Additionally, Quesada et
al. (2010) suggest that decreases in total phosphorus content can
result from the loss of dissolved organic and inorganic phosphorus
due to weathering processes, such as leaching or soil mass
reduction, as well as the permanent occlusion of phosphorus within
soil minerals, based on analyses of soil samples from six
South American countries, including Brazil.
