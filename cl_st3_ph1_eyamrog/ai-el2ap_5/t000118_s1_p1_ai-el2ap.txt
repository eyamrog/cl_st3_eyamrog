A new species of Vriesea Lindl. (Bromeliaceae), Vriesea altobocainensis, is
described and illustrated from the Atlantic Forest of Serra da
Bocaina, SÃ£o Paulo State, Brazil. This species is a robust
epiphyte distinguished by its reddish inflorescence and orbicular to broadly
ovate floral and primary bracts. Morphologically, V. altobocainensis is similar
to Vriesea altodaserrae L.B.Sm. and Vriesea sceptrum Mez., but it
can be differentiated from these species primarily by the color,
size, and shape of its floral and primary bracts, as
well as by the number of inflorescence branches and the
number of flowers per branch.
