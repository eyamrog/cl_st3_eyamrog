This analysis of Canadian university syllabuses quantifies the proportion of
assigned readings by publication type, demonstrating that academic sources constitute
the majority of assigned materials. Although the analysis does not
prescribe specific policy measures for compensating content creators, it offers
a framework for evaluating the outcomes of such policies, as
exemplified by the application of the proposed three-step syllabus rule.
This rule aims to prevent students from being charged multiple
times for materials to which they already have access, while
also accounting for the distinct economic models of scholarly and
trade publishing within the university setting. The predominance of scholarly
readings in these courses supports the rationale for differentiating between
these publication types when determining equitable arrangements for students, authors,
and publishers.
