The initial challenge encountered is the development of a general
classification of academic institutions using the "U-Multirank" system, which was
not originally designed for this purpose. Although general classification is
not its primary objective, U-Multirank is capable of generating such
rankings upon request. For instance, when a general classification of
Brazilian universities was requested in the 2020 edition, utilizing only
those indicators for which more than 90% of the data
were reported, the resulting list is presented in Table 1.
