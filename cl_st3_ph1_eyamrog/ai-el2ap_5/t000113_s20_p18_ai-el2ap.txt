The legitimizing myths associated with racist ideologies are either explicitly
or covertly instilled in individuals and institutions, contributing to the
perpetuation of these ideologies across the individual life course and
successive generations. This process results in the systematic confinement of
Black people in general, and Black women in particular, to
the lower strata of the social hierarchy (Osorio, 2004). Consequently,
Black Brazilian women experience a cycle of cumulative disadvantage (Hasenbalg,
2005) throughout various stages of their lives, which affects their
psychosocial development, behaviors, and perceptions. These cumulative disadvantages are illustrated
in Table 02.
