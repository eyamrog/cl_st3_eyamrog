These livestock practices, along with associated activities such as land
clearing, road construction, pasture demarcation, and the installation of water
supplies and fences, contribute to ecological imbalance. These disturbances promote
degradation processes and facilitate the introduction and invasion of exotic
species, which in turn lead to the reduction and fragmentation
of native species populations (Derner et al. 2009; Milchunas &
Lauenroth 1993). Additionally, several of these exotic species contain chemical
compounds that are potentially toxic to cattle, thereby contributing to
the deterioration of natural pastures (Bisigato et al. 2005; Krikor
& Hierro 2011; Marino 2008; Peralta and Klich in press).
