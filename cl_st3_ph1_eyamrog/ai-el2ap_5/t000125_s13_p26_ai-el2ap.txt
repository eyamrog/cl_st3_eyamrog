This approach to general classification is problematic because it does
not consider overall performance across all indicators. Additionally, assigning different
weights to each dimension can lead to bias, as dimensions
with a greater number of indicators may disproportionately influence the
overall evaluation. For example, according to the criteria defined by
“U-Multirank,” the Federal University of São Carlos is ranked second
with 3 A, 2 B, and 6 D grades, while
the University of São Paulo is ranked third with 3
A, 1 B, 3 C, and 5 D grades. If
a point system is applied, assigning values such as A
= 5, B = 4, C = 3, D =
2, and E = 1, the Federal University of São
Carlos would receive a total of 35 points, whereas the
University of São Paulo would receive 38 points, indicating a
higher overall performance. Consequently, the ranking order would be reversed,
with the University of São Paulo placed second. This example
illustrates that the current classification method may lead to inconsistencies,
and similar issues are likely to arise in other cases.
