Digital exclusion does not simply refer to the lack of
access to computers or mobile phones. Rather, it encompasses the
continued inability to conceptualize, develop, and implement new, more equitable
and dynamic forms of producing and distributing both symbolic and
material resources (Schwartz, 2000, as cited in Fantin & Girardello,
2009, p. 71).
