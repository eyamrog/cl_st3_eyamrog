Based on previous research (Drovetta 2015a; 2015b), it has been
proposed that abortion-related stigma is a significant factor that hinders
access to abortion services. Specifically, this stigma affects healthcare professionals,
who may fear experiencing negative social or professional consequences if
they assist women or girls in obtaining a legally permitted
abortion.
