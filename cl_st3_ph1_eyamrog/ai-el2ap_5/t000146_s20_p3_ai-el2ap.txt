In analyzing the citations obtained, two variables were used to
assess their relative impact based on the proportion of article
citations to the total number of citations: (a) citations in
the national language compared to citations in any language (Fig.
1-A), and (b) citations from the SciELO Citation Index (CI)
database compared to citations from all Web of Science (WoS)
databases (Fig. 1-B).
