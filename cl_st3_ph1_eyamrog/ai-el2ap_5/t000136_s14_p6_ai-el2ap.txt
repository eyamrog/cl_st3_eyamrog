Data were collected during the first two months of 2017
and pertain to the fiscal year 2015 to minimize the
risk of bias resulting from incomplete information. This approach was
necessary because the responsible authority releases all documents for a
given year only in the following year; therefore, using data
from 2016 or 2017 could have resulted in missing or
incomplete records.
