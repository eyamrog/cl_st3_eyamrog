Gas exchange—Solar radiation levels significantly influenced stomatal conductance (gs) and
transpiration rate (E) across both species, except at 150 days
after transplanting (DAT) (Figure 1a–d; ANOVA results in Supplementary Material
Table S2). Both E and gs were reduced in plants
grown under higher solar radiation retention (I75). At 150 DAT,
gs reached its lowest values compared to earlier sampling points.
When comparing species, M. laevigata exhibited higher gs than M.
glomerata (Supplementary Material Table S2).
