Conclusion: The extent to which a publication language is exposed
varies according to the scientific output of each country. For
Brazilian and US-American publications, the impact on audiences using other
languages can be assessed through citation metrics. Additionally, the level
of exposure provided by SciELO CI is valuable for evaluation
purposes, especially for publications written in the national language.
