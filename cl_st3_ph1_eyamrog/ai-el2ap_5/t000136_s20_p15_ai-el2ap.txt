In this study, transparency is defined in accordance with the
OECD disclosure principle (2004) as the public dissemination of relevant
information. Specifically, transparency was operationalized as the disclosure of information
via the Internet, including organizational websites and social media platforms,
concerning financial statements (whether audited or unaudited), the Annual Report,
and the professional qualifications of the nonprofit organization's executive team
and board members.
