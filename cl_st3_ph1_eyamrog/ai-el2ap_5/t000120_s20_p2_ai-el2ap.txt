The genus Urochloa comprises exotic invasive species that negatively affect
native species through interspecific resource competition, extensive cover growth, and
chemical inhibition via the release of secondary compounds (Horowitz et
al. 2007; Scabora 2011). These mechanisms confer a competitive advantage
to the exotic species, often resulting in the suppression or
local elimination of native plants, which may account for their
absence in the studied plots.
