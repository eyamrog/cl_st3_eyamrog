In this study, the indicators were classified into five major
categories based on the following characteristics: disease frequency and distribution,
social and collective adherence, installed capacity and assistance profile, productive
potential, and availability of inputs. These groups are presented and
described in Figure 1, which uses geometric symbols to designate
each category. The figure illustrates the territorial distribution of these
parameters according to the presence of health indicators in the
normative framework and the surveyed categories. A detailed description of
the indicators for each federation unit is provided in Supplementary
Table 1.
