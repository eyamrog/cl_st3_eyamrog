During the initial examination, the most frequently detected species were
the protozoa Giardia duodenalis (41.9%), Entamoeba coli (41.9%), and Endolimax
nana (37.2%), as well as the helminth Hymenolepis nana (23.3%).
These findings are consistent with those reported in previous studies
involving indigenous populations from Paran√° and other regions, although most
of these studies documented a lower prevalence of H. nana.
It should be noted that the Kato-Katz method was not
employed to assess the parasitic load of geohelminths, which represents
a limitation in the evaluation.
