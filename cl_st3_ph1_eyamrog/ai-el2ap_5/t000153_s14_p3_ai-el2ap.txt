The selection of interviewees was based on a purposive non-probability
sampling design, determined by considerations of accessibility and feasibility (Strauss
and Corbin 2002), and implemented through chain-referral (snowball) sampling. A
semi-structured interview instrument was developed for data collection. Interviews were
conducted at the workplaces and residences of Network members, as
well as during meetings organized by the Network. In some
instances, multiple interviews were conducted with the same participant to
enhance data collection. Each interview or meeting lasted approximately 40
minutes. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed for subsequent analysis.
To supplement the data, additional interviews were conducted with leaders
of civil society and women’s organizations, and documents produced and
distributed by the Network and related organizations were reviewed, with
particular attention to materials from the “Campaña Nacional por el
Derecho al Aborto Legal, Seguro y Gratuito” (National Campaign for
the Right to Legal, Safe and Free Abortion), “Católicas por
el derecho a decidir-Córdoba” (Catholics for the Right to Decide-Córdoba),
and “Socorristas en Red” (Women Rescuers Network). All interviewees participated
in the formation of the Network, and five additional interviews
were conducted with representatives of these organizations. The research project
received approval from the Ethics Committee of the Hospital Nacional
de Clínicas in Córdoba, Argentina. Verbal informed consent was obtained
from each participant after the scientific objectives of the study
were explained, and confidentiality of identity was assured. All participants
were healthcare professionals and activists working in the field of
women’s sexual and reproductive rights, were of legal age, and
provided consent to participate. Prior to each interview, the informed
consent form was read aloud, outlining the research objectives, the
guarantee of anonymity, the voluntary nature of participation, and the
right to withdraw at any time. Personal data are accessible
only to the principal investigator. All names have been changed,
and interviewees cannot be identified. These procedures and consents are
documented in the interview recordings.
