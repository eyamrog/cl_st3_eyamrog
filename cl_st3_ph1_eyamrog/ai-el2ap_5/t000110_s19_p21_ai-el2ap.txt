Valves are lanceolate to rhombic-lanceolate with rostrate apices; the axial
area is narrow, linear, and slightly widened in the central
region. The raphe is slightly curved. Striae are parallel and
become slightly radiate toward the apices. The stigma is located
at the end of the longest central striae. This taxon
exhibits morphological characteristics similar to those of Gomphonema naviculoides W.
Smith, particularly in valve shape; however, the two species differ
in valve dimensions and striae density. According to Reichardt (2015),
G. naviculoides has a length of 35–45 µm, a width
of 7.8–9.5 µm, and 12–14 striae per 10 µm. Due
to the lack of ultrastructural details from scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), Gomphonema sp. is retained as a distinct taxon. It
was observed in 8% of the core samples, with a
maximum relative abundance of 2.3%. This taxon occurs during the
Late Holocene, from approximately 1,322 calibrated years BP.
