This section provides an explanation of the Kapetanios, Shin, and
Snell (KSS) (2006) Cointegration Test, which is a nonlinear cointegration
test, as well as the Banerjee, Arčabić, and Lee (2017)
Fourier Cointegration Test, which is based on Fourier functions; both
tests were employed in the analysis.
