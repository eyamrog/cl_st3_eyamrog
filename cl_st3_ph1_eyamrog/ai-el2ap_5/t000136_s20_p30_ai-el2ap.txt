The absence of, or deficiencies in, governance practices can lead
to donor reluctance to contribute to nonprofit organizations (NPOs). Fisman
and Hubbard (2005) argue that inadequate governance results in insufficient
management monitoring, thereby increasing agency costs. Figure 2 displays the
R² values for each endogenous latent variable, which serve as
indicators of the model’s explanatory power. It is important to
note that the R² value of the first-order reflective construct’s
latent variable reflects the extent to which this variable represents
the second-order construct. Consequently, this R² value was analyzed, as
it also contributes to the structural model through its generated
paths.
