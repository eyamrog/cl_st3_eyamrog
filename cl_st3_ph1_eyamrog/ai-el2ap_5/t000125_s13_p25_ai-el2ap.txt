To generate this classification, U-Multirank employs a criterion analogous to
an Olympic medals table, in which universities are ranked primarily
by the number of A grades they receive. Institutions with
the highest number of A grades are considered the top
performers, while grades of B and below are used only
to break ties. According to this method, the Federal University
of Rio de Janeiro ranks first, having achieved 3 A,
3 B, 2 C, and 3 D grades, compared to
the Federal University of SÃ£o Carlos, which ranks second with
3 A, 2 B, and 6 D grades. The same
rule is applied to determine the subsequent positions in the
overall classification.
