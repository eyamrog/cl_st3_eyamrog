Both the reports coordinated by Faure (1973) and Delors (1998)
emphasize the importance of reorienting education towards a future that
extends beyond traditional schooling. Both reports advocate for a shift
from learning confined to specific times and places within formal
educational institutions to a model of lifelong learning that occurs
continuously and in diverse contexts. They argue that learning should
not be restricted to a particular period or location, nor
should it be limited to the formal processes of schooling;
rather, it should become an integral aspect of individuals' lives
in contemporary society. This reconfiguration of the temporal and spatial
dimensions of learning is considered essential, as it enables individuals
to navigate and manage their own development in a context
characterized by rapid change and globalization, which fundamentally alters the
ways in which people relate to time and space (Delors
et al., 1998, p. 104).
