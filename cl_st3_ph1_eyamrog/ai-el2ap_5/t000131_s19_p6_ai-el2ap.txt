Leaf anatomy â€“ The effects of increased retention of solar
radiation flux on leaf anatomy were consistent in both species.
As the retention of solar radiation flux increased, the thickness
of the adaxial epidermis (AdE) and mesophyll (including both palisade
and spongy parenchyma) decreased (Table 1). The AdE thickness in
the I0 treatment was approximately 1.2-fold higher in M. glomerata
and 1.3-fold higher in M. laevigata compared to the I75
treatment. Under I0, I25, and I50 conditions, the AdE thickness
in M. laevigata was, on average, 1.4-fold higher at 90
days after treatment (DAT) and 1.7-fold higher at 150 DAT
than in M. glomerata. Under I75, M. laevigata also exhibited
a higher AdE, with values 1.2-fold and 1.4-fold greater than
those of M. glomerata at 90 and 150 DAT, respectively.
At 150 DAT under I0, the thickness of the palisade
and spongy parenchyma was 10% and 17% higher, respectively, in
M. laevigata compared to M. glomerata (Table 1).
