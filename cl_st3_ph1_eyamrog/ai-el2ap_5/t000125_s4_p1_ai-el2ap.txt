This study evaluated the performance of Brazilian universities in the
U-Multirank from 2017 to 2020. U-Multirank is a multidimensional academic
ranking system that has gained significance in Brazil, as it
serves as the basis for the new evaluation method to
be implemented by Capes for the assessment of the country's
postgraduate system.
