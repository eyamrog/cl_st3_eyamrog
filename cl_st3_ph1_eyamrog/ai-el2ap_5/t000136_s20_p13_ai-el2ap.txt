The existence of formal policies can facilitate the confidential reporting
of unethical behavior by employees, help prevent conflicts of interest
(such as through codes of conduct or anti-corruption policies), and
provide guidance for management practices. By reducing information asymmetry, these
policies can enhance the governance of non-profit organizations (NPOs) and
increase donors’ confidence that their contributions are being used effectively
to advance the NPO’s institutional mission.
