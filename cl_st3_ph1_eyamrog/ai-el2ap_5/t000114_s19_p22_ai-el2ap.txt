Leaves are squarrose to erect-patent, concave at the base, and
ovate with a broad base; upper laminal cells are smaller,
while supra-alar cells are larger than the alar cells. Capsules
are typically suberect and larger than those of D. commutata
(Müll.Hal.) W.R. Buck, as described by Buck (1994). This species
is corticolous in both the Amazon and Atlantic Forests and
has been recorded in the Brazilian states of Pará (PA),
Minas Gerais (MG), Rio de Janeiro (RJ), Rio Grande do
Sul (RS), Santa Catarina (SC), and São Paulo (SP), as
well as throughout the Neotropics.
