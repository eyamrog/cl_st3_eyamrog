Methods: This retrospective ecological study utilized data from Brazilian municipalities,
sourced from the information systems of the National Public Health
System. The primary outcomes assessed were the number of medical
appointments, prenatal procedures, and diabetes care interventions. The main exposure
variable was the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic, defined by
the date of the first reported case in Brazil. Associations
between the number of procedures per 10,000 inhabitants and the
COVID-19 pandemic were analyzed using multilevel mixed-effects negative binomial regression.
