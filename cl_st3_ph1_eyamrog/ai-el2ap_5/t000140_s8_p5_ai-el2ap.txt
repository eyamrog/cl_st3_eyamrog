In 2019, Canadaâ€™s Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology
released its Statutory Review of the Copyright Act Report, which
included a recommendation that the committee resume its review of
the implementation of educational fair dealing in the Canadian educational
sector within three years, utilizing new and authoritative information as
well as considering recent legal developments (Ruimy, 2019). This study
aims to contribute new and authoritative information relevant to educational
fair dealing, with particular attention to issues that have influenced
past court decisions and may inform future rulings and potential
amendments to the Copyright Act. Specifically, the study analyzes how
distinctions between scholarly and trade publishing, both historical and contemporary,
may be relevant in determining appropriate compensation for the use
of these types of literature by students in university courses.
