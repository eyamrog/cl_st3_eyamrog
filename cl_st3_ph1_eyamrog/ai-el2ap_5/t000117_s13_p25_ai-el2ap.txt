The phrase that serves as the book’s title appears to
reference Foucault’s Discipline and Punish (2014), which is cited once
in the following passage: “some theoreticians, like Michael Foucault, have
identified great similarities between schooling spaces and prison spaces, madhouses
and hospitals, in which structures and functioning are marked by
forms of control and punishment” (Barros, 2018, p. 29).
