Although the Southeast region of the country has been extensively
studied, there are no published studies specifically addressing the bryoflora
of the PNC. Existing information is limited to a few
records from occasional collections (Yano & Peralta 2008; Yano 2010,
2012). In the state of Espírito Santo, scientific studies remain
scarce; among the most recent are Costa & Silva (2003)
and Yano (2005) in broadleaf forests, Silva & Piassi (2010)
in restinga, and Silva (2011), Silva & Bastos (2012), Sousa
& Faria (2016), and Faria et al. (2020) in ombrophilous
forest. The objective of this study was to conduct a
survey of moss species occurring along the visitation trails of
the PNC, starting at the entrance in the Espírito Santo
sector, with the aim of expanding knowledge of the bryophyte
flora in the state and the Atlantic Forest, and contributing
to the conservation of ecologically significant, particularly threatened, species.
