Table 1 presents the 59 plant families identified in the
study area, indicating the number of species within each family
and their respective percentages of total species representation. The Asteraceae
is the most represented family, comprising 20% of the total
species. This is followed by Poaceae with 15.66%, Fabaceae with
8.66%, Solanaceae with 6%, Verbenaceae with 4%, and Chenopodiaceae with
3.33%. Additionally, 47 families each account for less than 2%
of the total species, including Zygophyllaceae (4 species, 1.33%), Anacardiaceae
(2 species, 0.66%), and Elaeagnaceae (1 species, 0.33%), some of
which exhibit a high abundance of individuals despite their low
species richness.
