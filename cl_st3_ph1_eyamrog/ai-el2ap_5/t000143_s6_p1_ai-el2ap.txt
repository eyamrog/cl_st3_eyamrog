This study has several limitations related to its methodology. The
potential for ecological fallacy remains, as associations identified at the
aggregate level do not necessarily reflect associations at the individual
level. Additionally, the study may be subject to low construct
validity, given that not all relevant explanatory variables may have
been included in the analysis. To mitigate some of these
limitations, the study utilized variables from multiple national databases; however,
this approach may introduce variability in data quality due to
reliance on indirect estimates.
