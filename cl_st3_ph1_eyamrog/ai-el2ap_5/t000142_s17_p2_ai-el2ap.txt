This study investigates the potential relationship between the depreciation of
the national currency and the incidence of femicide. Prior to
examining this relationship, tests for linearity were conducted using the
methods proposed by Harvey and Leybourne (2007) and Harvey, Leybourne,
and Xiao (2008). Subsequently, tests for stationarity were performed on
the data series.
