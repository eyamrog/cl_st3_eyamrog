Ert√ºrk (2015) argues that the female body is subjected to
social control to ensure the reproduction of generations according to
specific societal criteria. Historically, violence against women has been normalized
and utilized as a mechanism to maintain the division of
labor between genders. Empirical data indicate that such practices are
prevalent globally. Women are particularly vulnerable to violence and mortality
in societies where they are assigned lower value and afforded
fewer rights compared to men. Furthermore, gender imbalances, particularly a
disproportionately high number of males, can have significant negative consequences
for society.
