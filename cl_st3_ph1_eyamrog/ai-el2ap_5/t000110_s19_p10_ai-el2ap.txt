Costa et al. (2017b) reported that the type material of
Eunotia camelus Ehrenberg, as illustrated in Reichardt (1995), comprised a
population consisting of two distinct species, which has led to
confusion in the classification of this taxon. In southeastern Brazil,
most populations previously identified as E. camelus have been determined
to be Eunotia longicamelus L.F.Costa, D.C.Bicudo & C.E.Wetzel. This species
was present in 15% of the core samples analyzed and
reached a maximum relative abundance of 3%. It was recorded
in samples ranging from the early Late Holocene (~1,514 calibrated
years BP) to the top of the core.
