Considering kinship as an analytical framework for understanding migration reveals
aspects that current models often overlook, particularly the diversity of
relationships that constitute the kinship networks of migrants. Existing models
tend to conceptualize family as one among several sociological factors,
but they frequently rely on a narrow and static definition
of family, which leads to the marginalization of the actual
diversity present in migrantsâ€™ kinship structures. The following three examples
serve to demonstrate the range of migrant kinship arrangements and
highlight how this diversity is frequently neglected by prevailing analytical
approaches.
