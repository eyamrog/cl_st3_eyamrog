Ordinance 2117/2019 (Federative Republic of Brazil 2019) permits up to
40% of the theoretical course load in higher education to
be delivered via digital platforms. As a result, many private
higher education institutions (HEIs) have already integrated information and communication
technologies (ICT) into their distance learning practices, which has supported
the continuity of academic programs. In contrast, the implementation of
this ordinance in public HEIs has been inconsistent, largely due
to resistance to distance education. Barone (2020) noted that platforms
provided by the Ministry of Education are often underutilized in
higher education, highlighting ongoing reluctance to adopt technology in teacher
training and challenges associated with transitioning to new instructional methods.
In 2020, the academic year in public universities was significantly
disrupted, as students in these institutions were disproportionately affected by
social inequalities, geographic isolation, and limited access to ICT.
