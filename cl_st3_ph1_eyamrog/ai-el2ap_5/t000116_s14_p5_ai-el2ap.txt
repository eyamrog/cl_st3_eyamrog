We analyzed the data for the 19 groups of causes
across the three periods by calculating the means, standard deviations,
and quartiles for each group in each period. These descriptive
statistics were visually examined using box plots to facilitate comparison
among groups and periods. To ensure the validity of mean
comparisons, we assessed the normality of the data distributions using
the Shapiro-Wilk test and evaluated homoscedasticity with the Levene test.
In addition to determining whether statistically significant differences existed among
groups, we aimed to identify specific differences between pairs of
periods (period one vs. period two, period one vs. period
three, and period two vs. period three). Therefore, we employed
both ANOVA and a post-hoc analysis using the Tukey test.
