Data collection was carried out through invitations distributed via social
networks, primarily Facebook and Instagram. The study received approval from
the National Research Ethics Committee (CONEP) under approval number [omitted
for evaluation]. The online questionnaire targeted the general population, and
participants were encouraged to share the survey with others in
their social networks. A Free and Informed Consent Form was
presented at the beginning of the questionnaire, and completion was
permitted only after participants provided consent. The questionnaire was designed
as a brief screening tool, with an average completion time
of five minutes, as recorded automatically by the data collection
platform.
