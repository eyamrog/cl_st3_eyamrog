The study found that the prevalence of enteroparasitosis among indigenous
schoolchildren of the Guarani ethnic group in a village in
the State of Paran√°, Southern Brazil, remained high and did
not decrease following mass treatment of the population with anthelmintic
medication. The use of albendazole (ABZ) as the sole control
measure was not effective in reducing enteroparasite infections in these
schoolchildren. While geohelminth infections were eliminated after the implementation of
the treatment strategy, sustained benefits for the community are likely
to require improvements in sanitation and the introduction of additional
educational programs to prevent reinfection by intestinal protozoa.
