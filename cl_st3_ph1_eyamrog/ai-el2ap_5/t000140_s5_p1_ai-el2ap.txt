In determining an appropriate price for the use of published
materials assigned in Canadian university courses, several factors must be
considered. Notably, journal articles and scholarly book chapters constitute 90.1
percent of the pages assigned to students (Table 6), and
these materials are part of a distinct scholarly publishing economy
that has historically operated separately from trade publishing. The differences
between scholarly and trade publishing justify an alternative approach to
the management of university course readings, which is demonstrated using
the data presented in this study. This issue is relevant
to the 2020 Federal Court of Appeal decision in York
v. Access Copyright, which observed that “York did not justify
[its claim to ‘fair dealing’] beyond invoking education as an
allowable purpose” (YU, 2020, 258). The present analysis aims to
provide a more comprehensive justification for limiting and refining the
application of fair dealing to university course readings, based on
the structural differences between scholarly and trade publishing sectors. This
approach necessitates the establishment of conventions and standards for categorizing
assigned readings, including distinctions between academic and professional authorship. Accordingly,
a “three-step syllabus rule” is proposed to guide the fair
use of readings assigned in university courses. The technical details
of this rule are provided in the appendix, with a
summary included below.
