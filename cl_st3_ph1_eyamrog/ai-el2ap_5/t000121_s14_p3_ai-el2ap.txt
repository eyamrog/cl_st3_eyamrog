A sociodemographic questionnaire was administered, including the following variables: sex
(male or female), age (in years), skin color (white, black,
or brown; participants identifying as yellow or indigenous were excluded
from the final sample due to low representation), education level
(up to high school or higher education), living arrangement (living
alone: yes or no), presence of chronic disease (yes or
no), income status (with or without steady income), self-perceived health
status (ill or healthy), and place of residence (municipality and
state).
