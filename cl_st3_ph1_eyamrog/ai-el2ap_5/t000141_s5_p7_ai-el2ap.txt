Furthermore, the existence of an official plan that is adopted
transparently, widely communicated to the public, and characterized by clear,
well-defined, and easily understood criteria is essential to minimize the
influence of specific groups or sectors that may seek to
affect government decision-making. Consequently, the use of objective indicators is
fundamental to the effectiveness of government strategies and, most importantly,
to ensure their implementation is equitable and democratic, grounded in
scientific evidence and prioritizing the welfare of the population.
