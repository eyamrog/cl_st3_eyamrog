In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) identified the
spread of SARS-CoV-2 as a global public health concern and,
two months later, officially declared a pandemic status.(1,2) These decisions
were based on the pathogenicity and virulence of the novel
coronavirus, as well as the lack of effective treatment options
at that time.(3-5) Consequently, governmental interventions aimed at reducing transmission
and mortality, which are essential for epidemic control, have had
significant global effects; however, the full extent of their impact
remains uncertain.(6)
