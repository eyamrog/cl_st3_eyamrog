The analytical framework should be subject to continuous revision, as
empirical reality does not always conform precisely to theoretical models.
This situation presents several potential outcomes, one of which is
the rigidity of the framework; in such cases, there is
a tendency to impose the model onto reality, thereby transforming
the framework from a tool that facilitates critical analysis into
an obstacle that impedes the understanding of the phenomena under
investigation. Consequently, the framework can either support or obstruct the
research process. When it becomes obstructive, the phenomena intended to
be elucidated may instead be obscured by the limitations of
the framework itself.
