In the following case, the focus shifts to Brazilian immigrants
in Portugal from the perspective of their family members who
remain in Brazil, specifically in the city of Governador Valadares.
For these migrants, the migration experience was characterized by clearly
defined objectives, such as accumulating sufficient resources to construct homes
and establish businesses that would ensure the family's economic stability.
The experiences of these immigrants are shaped by a distinct
kinship structure prevalent in Governador Valadares, which, as previously demonstrated,
is organized around the aspiration to form autonomous family units
while maintaining concentrated networks of relationships.
