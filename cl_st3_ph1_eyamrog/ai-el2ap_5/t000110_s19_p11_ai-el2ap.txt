Eunotia longicamelus L.F.Costa, D.C.Bicudo & C.E.Wetzel was described by Costa
et al. (2017b) based on specimens collected from the Ponte
Nova Reservoir in southeastern Brazil. Although E. longicamelus is frequently
identified and cited as E. camelus Ehrenberg, it can be
distinguished by its narrower valves, a dorsal margin with two
or four major undulations, and a less concave ventral margin
(Costa et al. 2017b). In the present study, E. longicamelus
was recorded in 11% of the core samples, with a
maximum relative abundance of 2.5%, and its presence was detected
from approximately 5,192 calibrated years before present (cal. yr BP)
to the top of the core, indicating its persistence since
the end of the Mid-Holocene. This survey represents the first
documented occurrence of E. longicamelus in the Brazilian Amazon.
