Two of the three most abundant snake species recorded during
our surveys belonged to the family Viperidae (Bothrops jararaca and
Bothrops jararacussu), which are commonly found in mainland Atlantic Forest
areas (Marques & Sazima 2004; Pontes et al. 2009). The
dipsadid Thamnodynastes cf. nattereri was the second most abundant species
in the PNT and was also among the most abundant
in the PNM Serra do Mendanha (Pontes et al. 2009).
