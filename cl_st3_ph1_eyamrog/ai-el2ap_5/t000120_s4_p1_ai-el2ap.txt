The transposition of litter from the Semideciduous Seasonal Forest to
soil disturbed by Urochloa brizantha did not result in increased
richness of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus species, nor did it facilitate
the colonization of plant species beneficial for ecological restoration. These
findings suggest that complete removal of Urochloa brizantha is necessary
prior to implementing restoration measures.
