In Equation 7, \( p \) denotes the number of
lags, and \( \Delta \) represents the difference operator. The
\( W_0 \) test statistics, used to assess stationarity, and
the \( W_1 \) test statistics, used to assess nonstationarity,
are both calculated based on the \( W_\lambda \) test
statistics proposed by Harvey et al. (2008). These statistics follow
the distribution of \( W_\lambda \chi^2_2 \).
