In Equation 4, \( b \) denotes a non-zero constant,
\( \text{DFT} \) represents the standard Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) t-statistics
obtained from the restricted regression, and \( T \) refers
to the number of observations. \( \text{RSS}_1 \) denotes the
sum of squared residuals under the alternative hypothesis (\( H_1
\)). The test statistics proposed by Harvey and Leybourne (2007)
are appropriate for the distribution of \( x_4^2 \).
