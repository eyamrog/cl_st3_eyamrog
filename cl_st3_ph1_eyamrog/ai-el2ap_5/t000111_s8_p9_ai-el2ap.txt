The apposition in (6) provides the anchor ("The big apple")
with additional information, functioning as a specification of the anchor.
Regarding attributive apposition, the author cites Cardoso and De Vries
(2010), who argue that the type of apposition exemplified in
(7) is derived from a reduced relative clause containing an
unpronounced copula and relative pronoun; thus, it involves a form
of predication on the anchor.
