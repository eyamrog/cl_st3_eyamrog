This paper examines the relationship between the concept of "family,"
often used in a vague manner, and the more analytically
precise notion of "kinship," specifically within migratory contexts. Drawing on
three case studies conducted by my research group, the analysis
aims to critically assess the role and positioning of the
family in migration studies. The paper argues that the term
"family" frequently functions to obscure significant differences and serves as
a simplifying mechanism that may not withstand scrutiny if the
complexities of kinship were to be rigorously addressed.
