Worry levels were measured using the Meta-Worry Questionnaire (MWQ), originally
developed by Wells (2005). The Portuguese version of the MWQ,
adapted and validated by Dinis and Gouveia (2011), demonstrated good
internal consistency (α = 0.89). The MWQ consists of seven
items presented as questions, each assessed on two separate scales:
one measuring the frequency of metacognitions about worry and the
other assessing the strength of related beliefs. In the present
study, only the scale measuring the frequency of worry was
utilized to enable a brief mental health screening and minimize
the length of the assessment. Responses are recorded on a
4-point Likert scale ranging from “never” (1) to “always” (4).
The total score is calculated by summing the responses to
all items, with higher scores indicating a greater frequency of
worry and an increased likelihood of dysfunctional worry. In the
current sample, the instrument demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha
[α] = 0.90).
