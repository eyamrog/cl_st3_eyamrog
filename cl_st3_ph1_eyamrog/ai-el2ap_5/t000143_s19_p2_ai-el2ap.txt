The distribution of mortality rates due to femicide was not
random, as indicated by significant positive spatial autocorrelation (I =
0.0993881; p-value = 0.001 based on 999 permutations). Spatial autocorrelation
of the "high-high" type was observed, indicating clusters of municipalities
in the central region of Sergipe (Areia Branca, Malhador, Santa
Rosa de Lima, Ribeirópolis) with the highest femicide mortality rates.
Conversely, "low-low" spatial autocorrelation was identified among municipalities with the
lowest rates, specifically Nossa Senhora de Lourdes, Propriá, São Francisco,
and Japaratuba (Fig. 2). Additionally, a "low-high" spatial autocorrelation was
detected in Maruim, indicating that this municipality exhibited low femicide
rates while neighboring municipalities had high rates. In contrast, the
municipalities of Lagarto, Aquidabã, and Carmópolis demonstrated "high-low" spatial autocorrelation,
characterized by high femicide rates in these municipalities and low
rates in the surrounding areas (Fig. 2).
