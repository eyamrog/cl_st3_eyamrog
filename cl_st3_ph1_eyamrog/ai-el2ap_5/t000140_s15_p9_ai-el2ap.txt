Prior to participation, students were required to achieve a minimum
score of 80 percent on a test set of syllabuses,
which were evaluated according to the lead researcher’s classification of
reading types. During the main phase of the study, students
cross-checked a small sample (5–20) of each other's scored syllabuses,
and any discrepancies were resolved by a third student who
had previously demonstrated consistent scoring in cross-checking; the lead researcher
intervened when necessary. In cases where additional scoring discrepancies were
identified, a subset of students with higher demonstrated proficiency was
assigned to re-analyze the relevant data. Additionally, students recorded page
counts for a sample of readings that included page-number information
(see Table 2). The total number of pages was divided
by the number of readings in the sample to calculate
the average number of pages per reading for each reading
type.
