This species is characterized by erect to spreading leaves that
are oblong to oblong-lanceolate, strongly concave, with a long-acuminate apex;
the apical cells are elongated, and the alar and supra-alar
cells are larger. In this study, specimens were collected from
rocks adjacent to streams. The species is known to occur
on soil, bark, and rocks (terricolous, corticolous, and rupicolous substrates)
within the Amazon Forest, Atlantic Forest, and Cerrado biomes, and
has been recorded in the Brazilian states of BA, DF,
ES, GO, MG, MT, MS, PA, PE, PR, RJ, RO,
RR, RS, SC, SP, and TO. It is endemic to
Brazil. Although there is a nomenclatural conflict in Flora do
Brasil 2020 (2021), V. galipense is considered a homotypic synonym
of Sematophyllum galipense (MÃ¼ll.Hal.) Mitt., as supported by Carvalho-Silva et
al. (2017).
