Although the National Educational Plan (PNE) projects an annual growth
rate of 1.8% in higher education institution (HEI) enrolments (Ministry
of Education of Brazil 2020b), several additional factors continue to
impede access to higher education. Less developed regions of Brazil
have a limited distribution of public HEIs, which restricts access
for high school graduates who are unable to relocate to
major urban centers. The establishment of decentralized campuses by public
HEIs in remote areas has only recently begun. Conversely, Decree
9057/2017 (Federative Republic of Brazil 2017b), which authorizes and recognizes
degrees obtained entirely through distance education, has facilitated rapid expansion
in this sector. However, there remains significant resistance to and
low acceptance of distance learning within the Brazilian educational system.
