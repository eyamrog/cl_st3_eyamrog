The prevalence of enteroparasites among students in a Guarani indigenous
village in southern Brazil was assessed before and after mass
administration of anthelmintic medication. No significant difference was observed in
the overall frequency of enteroparasites between the initial fecal sample
collection and the subsequent collection following treatment with albendazole (ABZ),
with the exception of E. histolytica/E. dispar cysts, which demonstrated
a higher frequency post-treatment.
