While university textbooks constitute a well-established segment of the publishing
industry and provide a structured framework for the instructional design
of many post-secondary courses, numerous instructors—particularly in the social sciences
and humanities—have for decades chosen instead to assign students a
diverse selection of articles, book chapters, and excerpts sourced from
original scholarly and trade publications. Such compilations, as described by
Ehren Helmut Pflugfelder (2012, p. 249), occupy a marginal position
within academic resource provision. The widespread adoption of this approach
became feasible with the emergence of copy-shops in the 1980s,
which facilitated the reproduction and distribution of these materials. Consequently,
these practices have been subject to copyright infringement litigation, most
notably exemplified by the Basic Books v. Kinko's Graphics (1991)
case in the United States.
