Thus, the audit report serves as an indicator of an
NPO’s reputation (Watts and Zimmerman, 1978) and provides an independent
assessment that contributes to the reduction of agency costs (Harris
et al., 2015; Watts and Zimmerman, 1978). As a result,
donors are more likely to have confidence in the reliability
of the NPO’s financial and accounting information and in the
safeguarding of donated resources.
