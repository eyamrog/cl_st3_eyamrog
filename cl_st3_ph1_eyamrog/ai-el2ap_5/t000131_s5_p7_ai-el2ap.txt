In this study, higher dry matter production was observed in
both Mikania species under elevated solar irradiance. Similar patterns have
been reported in other liana species, including Acacia kamerunensis, Loeseneriella
rowlandii, Afrobrunnichia erecta (Toledo-Aceves & Swaine 2008), and Plukenetia volubilis
(Cai 2011). Biomass accumulation is largely dependent on the transport
of photoassimilates between plant organs, as well as on cell
division and expansion. High light levels in this study increased
photosynthetic rates, likely resulting in greater carbohydrate production and dry
matter accumulation. The data indicate that plants grown under low
light conditions allocated a higher proportion of assimilates to aerial
organs, which may facilitate access to light in the upper
canopy and optimize photosynthetic efficiency in environments where light is
a limiting factor (Thompson et al. 1992, Walters et al.
1993). Leaf biomass in both Mikania species was greater in
plants exposed to higher light, which contrasts with the findings
of Boeger et al. (2009), who reported increased leaf biomass
in M. glomerata under shaded conditions. Additionally, higher root biomass
was observed in both species under full sunlight, which may
enhance water and nutrient uptake and support increased photosynthetic and
transpiration rates in high-light environments (Poorter 2001, Mielke & Schaffer
2010).
