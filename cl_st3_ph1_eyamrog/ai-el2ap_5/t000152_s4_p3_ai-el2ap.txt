Overall, the COVID-19 crisis has highlighted and intensified the need
to improve access to higher education for socially disadvantaged students,
particularly in consideration of the post-pandemic context. The universalization of
higher education through legislative measures, similar to those enacted for
primary and lower secondary education in 1996, is a critical
objective. It is essential that public policies supporting the financing
of private higher education are expanded by the state, with
the aim of reducing tuition fees and increasing accessibility for
socially disadvantaged students.
