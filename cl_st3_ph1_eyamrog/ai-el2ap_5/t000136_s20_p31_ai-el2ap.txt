The R² values obtained are considered relevant, particularly in light
of the variables not included in the model. An R²
of 0.508 indicates that the model explains 51% of the
variance in Donations, which represents a reasonable level of model
fit given its economic context. According to the gradation proposed
by Sanchez (2013), R² values below 0.2 indicate low explanatory
power, values between 0.2 and 0.5 indicate moderate explanatory power,
and values above 0.5 indicate high explanatory power. Wetzels et
al. (2009) state that in reflective-reflective models, first-order constructs reflect
second-order constructs, implying that the R² values of first-order latent
variables indicate the extent to which they are explained by
the variance of the corresponding second-order latent variables. In this
context, the R² of a first-order reflective construct’s latent variable
quantifies the proportion of its variance attributable to the second-order
construct. Applying the terminology of Wetzels et al. (2009), the
Management sub-dimension within the Governance construct demonstrates the highest level
of reflection with an R² of 0.528, whereas the Fiscal
Council sub-dimension exhibits a lower reflection with an R² of
0.181.
