The variable "living alone," which may be associated with a
lower perception of social support, was found to increase the
likelihood of experiencing depressive symptoms only. Existing literature indicates that
individuals who live alone are less likely to share their
concerns and fears during the pandemic, except through digital means
(Jacob, Haro, & Koyanagi, 2019; Stahl, Beach, Musa, & Schulz,
2017). Consequently, it is plausible that individuals living alone may
perceive themselves as having less access to support if they
are affected by COVID-19.
