Bostrychia species exhibit apical cell growth in their branches and
possess a Polysiphonia-type life history. During the tetrasporophyte stage (diploid),
tetraspores (haploid) are released and subsequently develop into male and
female gametophytes (haploid). Male gametophytes produce and release spermatia (haploid),
which fertilize the carpogonium (haploid) located at the end of
carpogonial branches of the female gametophytes. Following fertilization, carposporophytes (diploid)
are formed, which in turn produce and release carpospores (diploid)
that develop into tetrasporophytes (West et al. 1993; West et
al. 2001).
