2. Limit fair dealing: The second step addresses scholarly readings
that are not yet accessible to students through the initial
step. For these materials, a targeted and limited application of
the fair dealing exception under the Copyright Act is proposed.
The fairness of this use is supported by the argument
that any potential substantial adverse effect on publishers is offset
by the significant reputational benefits authors gain when their work
is assigned in university courses. This exposure can contribute to
authorsâ€™ career advancement, which may result in indirect financial benefits
that surpass potential royalty payments and may also promote additional
sales for publishers. Even in cases where authors have transferred
their copyright, the Copyright Act continues to recognize their moral
rights, particularly those related to the protection of their honour
or reputation (section 28.2(1)). This justification for fair dealing, which
is limited to academic readings not addressed in the first
step, is further reinforced by the subsequent step in the
approach.
