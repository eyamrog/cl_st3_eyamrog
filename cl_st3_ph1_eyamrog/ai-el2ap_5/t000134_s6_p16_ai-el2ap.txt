Two species of herpetofauna recorded in the PNT, Hemidactylus mabouia
and Trachemys scripta, are considered exotic invaders. Hemidactylus mabouia, commonly
known as the house gecko, was introduced to Brazil from
Africa during the colonial period and has subsequently expanded its
distribution across various natural environments in the country (Rocha &
Bergallo 2011; Telles et al. 2015; Oliveira et al. 2016;
Winck et al. 2017). In the PNT, H. mabouia was
observed primarily in built-up areas, which is consistent with its
distribution patterns reported in other regions (Rocha et al. 2011;
Oliveira et al. 2016). The occurrence of this species near
the parkâ€™s natural habitats warrants particular attention due to its
potential to become invasive (Rocha et al. 2011).
