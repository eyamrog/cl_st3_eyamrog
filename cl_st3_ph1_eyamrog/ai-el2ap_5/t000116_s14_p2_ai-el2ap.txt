We limited the analysis to hospitalizations attributed to 74 causes,
as defined by the two-digit categories of the International Classification
of Diseases. The selection of causes was based on those
specified in National Ordinance No. 221 of 2008, which outlines
the list of admissions for conditions considered sensitive to primary
care (see Supplementary Material #1).
