Experimental design and statistical analysis: The effects of irradiance interference,
species, and their interactions were assessed using a two-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) with the SYSTAT software package (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL). Statistical significance was determined at P < 0.05.
When significant effects were detected, Tukey's post hoc test was
applied to identify differences among means. The ANOVA model included
two species, M. glomerata and M. laevigata, and four levels
of sunlight retention in the solar radiation flux treatment: 0%
(I0), 25% (I25), 50% (I50), and 75% (I75).
