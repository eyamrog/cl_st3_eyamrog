TDS (Theories of Dominance and Subordination) accounts for the subconscious
tendency to defend social hierarchies, which are maintained through a
set of ideals and belief systems. When a dominant or
hegemonic group possesses a disproportionate share of resources and advantages—such
as social status, power, wealth, and prestigious roles—a subordinate or
oppressed group is placed at a relative disadvantage (Acosta, 2019).
The theory thus emphasizes the social-psychological mechanisms through which ideological
structures are internalized and reflected in individual attitudes and beliefs
(Islam, 2014). In contemporary society, white individuals often experience privileges,
including greater access to employment opportunities, superior nutrition and healthcare,
increased life expectancy, and enhanced means to provide advantages such
as wealth, education, and social connections to their offspring. Conversely,
black individuals and other minority groups are currently four times
more likely to die from Covid-19 (Dyer, 2020). Furthermore, the
societal portrayal of minorities and oppressed groups is frequently negative,
characterized by stereotypes such as being uncontrolled, dangerous, lazy, and
dishonest, which stands in stark contrast to the positive “cultural
virtues” typically ascribed to the dominant group (Pratto et al.,
2000).
