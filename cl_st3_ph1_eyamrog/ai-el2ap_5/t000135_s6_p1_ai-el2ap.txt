The findings indicate a significant reduction in the availability of
medical appointments and the performance of procedures related to prenatal
and diabetes care during the periods compared. Analysis of the
total number of procedures revealed a decrease in procedure rates
for all months from February to December. This reduction may
be attributed to the redeployment of a substantial number of
health professionals to pandemic response efforts, as well as the
increased risk of Sars-Covid-19 infection among health professionals, which may
have led to workforce shortages. Additionally, concerns about potential infection
have resulted in decreased utilization of health services by individuals,
particularly in emergency situations, and have contributed to the postponement
of elective treatments. Furthermore, there has been no implementation of
organized primary health care (PHC) actions at the national level
in Brazil to address Covid-19, nor have monitoring and control
measures been specifically directed toward individuals with chronic health conditions
requiring ongoing care. These factors may help explain the results
observed in this study.
