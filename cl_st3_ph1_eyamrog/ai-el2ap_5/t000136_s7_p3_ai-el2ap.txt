Previous research has operationalized governance using a range of measurement
approaches. For instance, Kitching (2009) employs a single indicator of
governance, Yetman and Yetman (2012) utilize multiple indicators concurrently, and
Harris et al. (2015) develop measures for various governance dimensions.
Although each of these approaches is suitable for their respective
research questions and designs, there remains a gap in the
literature regarding a standardized method for measuring governance as a
latent variable, defined as a set of governance dimensions assessed
through underlying governance factors. Specifically, prior studies have constructed both
unidimensional factors and multidimensional constructs to represent governance dimensions and
have examined the effects of these factors and dimensions on
donation outcomes.
