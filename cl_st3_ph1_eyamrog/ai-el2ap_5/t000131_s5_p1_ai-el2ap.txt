In this study, we characterized the main morpho-physiological responses of
two tropical liana species to varying light availability. The primary
hypothesis was not supported, as Mikania glomerata exhibited superior growth
performance under I0, I25, and I50 light treatments, whereas Mikania
laevigata demonstrated improved performance specifically under I25. Plants cultivated under
I0 and I25 conditions displayed higher stomatal conductance (gs) and
transpiration rates (E). The observed increases in air temperature and
vapor pressure deficit (VPD) at 150 days after transplantation (DAT)
likely contributed to reductions in gs, E, and net photosynthetic
rate (A) in both Mikania species. Stomatal closure under high
light intensity, elevated temperature, and low relative humidity serves to
reduce water loss to the environment, but also limits CO2
uptake by the leaves (Hsie et al. 2015). Stomatal regulation
is considered an adaptive strategy, particularly during the dry season.
Under field conditions, enhanced intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) resulting
from reduced gs and stable A values represents an effective
mechanism for sustaining plant growth while minimizing excessive water loss
(Hanba et al. 2002).
