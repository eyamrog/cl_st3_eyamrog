In addition to the selectional properties of the matrix verb—which
clearly selects a question in (35) but not in (41)—free
relatives are reported to be subject to the so-called matching
effect (Bresnan & Grimshaw, 1977; Larson, 1987; Vogel, 2003). The
matching requirement stipulates that the category or case of the
wh-phrase must correspond to the selectional properties of both the
matrix verb and the verb within the relative clause. Any
mismatch between these elements results in ungrammaticality. In contrast, indirect
questions are not subject to this requirement, as demonstrated by
the contrast in (42) and (43).
