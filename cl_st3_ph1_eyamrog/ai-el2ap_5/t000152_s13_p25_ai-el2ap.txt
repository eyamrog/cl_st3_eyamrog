In addition to challenges related to employment, income, and digital
access, student retention in higher education during the pandemic is
also affected by factors such as reduced student autonomy, inadequate
home environments for participating in synchronous or asynchronous classes, and
concentration difficulties arising from disruptions in routine, all of which
necessitate cognitive adaptations to the teaching and learning process. Furthermore,
alterations in work schedules, increased physical and emotional fatigue among
those who remain employed, and a range of mental health
issues induced or intensified by social isolation require both physical
and psycho-emotional adjustments to address the obstacles associated with studying
during the pandemic (Sahu, 2020).
