Relative growth rates (RGRs) of the thalli were calculated using
the weights obtained between the second and third measurements, following
the recovery period. Thalli immersed in 1% povidone iodine for
30 seconds exhibited significantly higher RGRs (1.69% day⁻¹ ± 0.26)
compared to those immersed for 15 seconds (0.76% day⁻¹ ±
0.25) and 2 minutes (0.65% day⁻¹ ± 0.63). However, no
significant differences were observed when the 30-second treatment was compared
to the control (1.15% day⁻¹ ± 0.42) or the 1-minute
treatment (1.13% day⁻¹ ± 0.63). Thalli immersed in 0.2% sodium
hypochlorite for 5 minutes exhibited the lowest RGR (0.46% day⁻¹
± 0.14), which was significantly lower than those immersed for
2 minutes (1.19% day⁻¹ ± 0.30), 1 minute (1.02% day⁻¹
± 0.22), and the control (see Figure 2). These results
indicate that immersion in 1% povidone iodine did not negatively
affect thalli growth, whereas immersion in 0.2% sodium hypochlorite for
5 minutes had a detrimental effect.
