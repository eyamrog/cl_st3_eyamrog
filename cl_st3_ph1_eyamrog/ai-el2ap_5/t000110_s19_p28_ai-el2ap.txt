Navicula notha Wallace is morphologically similar to Navicula cryptocephala KÃ¼tzing
(1844: 95) in terms of valve shape, but can be
distinguished by its smaller valves, the presence of an inconspicuous
central area in smaller specimens, and a rhombic shape in
larger specimens (Potapova 2011). This species was identified in only
3% of the core samples, with a maximum relative abundance
of 1.3%. It was detected in samples corresponding to the
Late Holocene (~2,909 cal. yr BP). This study represents the
first documented occurrence of N. notha in the Brazilian Amazon.
