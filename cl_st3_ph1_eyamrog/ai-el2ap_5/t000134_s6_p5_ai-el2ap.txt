With 14 species, Dipsadidae was the most diverse reptilian family
recorded in the PNT, a pattern that aligns with observations
of Squamata diversity in Atlantic Forest remnants in the state
of Rio de Janeiro (e.g., Pontes et al. 2009; Rocha
et al. 2018; Martins et al. 2019). Dipsadidae is widely
distributed throughout the Americas and the West Indies (Hedges et
al. 2009; Zaher et al. 2009; Grazziotin et al. 2012)
and comprises the majority of snake species in the Neotropical
region, with more than 700 recognized species (Uetz et al.
2019).
