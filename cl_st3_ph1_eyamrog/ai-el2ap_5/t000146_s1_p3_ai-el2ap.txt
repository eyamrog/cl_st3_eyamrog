Brazilian publications in Portuguese exhibited the highest citation impact within
the same language (55.7%), whereas Brazilian publications in English received
47.9% of their citations from Portuguese-language sources and 34.4% from
Spanish-language sources. The national language also accounted for a significant
proportion of citations for Colombian and Spanish publications. For Spain,
the proportion of citing articles in Spanish for papers published
in Spanish was more than twice that of those published
in English. Among US publications, 42.5% of citations were in
the native language when the articles were published in English.
Cuban and Peruvian publications received over 90% of their citation
impact from sources in the national language. In contrast, publications
from the USA and Brazil demonstrated a greater citation impact
in other languages, particularly when publishing in Spanish.
