In multiple spatial regression analysis, the Municipal Human Development Index
(MHDI) was found to be positively associated with femicide rates.
This finding highlights a contradiction, as it indicates an increase
in femicide in areas with higher human development, which contrasts
with previous studies that have reported an inverse relationship between
femicide occurrence and both economic development and population quality of
life.
