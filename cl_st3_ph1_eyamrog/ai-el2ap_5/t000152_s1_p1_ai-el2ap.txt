The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in both immediate
and long-term direct and indirect effects on education. The suspension
of in-person interactions among students and teachers has posed significant
challenges, particularly regarding access, retention, and academic training in both
public and private higher education institutions, due to broader economic
and labor market disruptions. This article aims to analyze the
impacts of COVID-19 on the access to and retention of
low-income populations in Brazilian higher education. The study utilizes data
from Brazilian educational censuses, which include information on both in-person
and distance higher education, as well as journalistic and documentary
sources that provide insight into the countryâ€™s geographical and social
contexts. The analysis identifies public policies implemented by the Brazilian
government to facilitate access to and retention in higher education.
Nevertheless, public institutions are unable to accommodate all students. Distance
education offered by private institutions has reached various social classes;
however, the effects of the pandemic have disproportionately affected low-income
and impoverished populations. Many students at public universities lack adequate
access to technology, while those attending private institutions often face
difficulties in paying tuition due to widespread job losses across
multiple sectors.
