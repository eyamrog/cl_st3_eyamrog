All other countries demonstrate a more substantial impact on SciELO
CI when publishing in Spanish, including the United States. In
contrast to the patterns observed regarding the language of cited
articles, the SciELO CI regional database serves as a valuable
resource and effectively highlights the impact of publications in Spanish
or Portuguese. Conversely, the influence of publications in English is
more pronounced in the WoS database, particularly for Brazil, followed
by Colombia and Spain. It is important to note that
citations to the United States for publications in English account
for less than 9%, as their impact is primarily observed
outside the SciELO CI database.
