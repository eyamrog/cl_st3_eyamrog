One approach to estimating the size of a research audience
that extends across national boundaries is to analyze citations originating
from a specific country [24]. This method provides insight into
the types of research being conducted in different geographical regions
and is reflected in certain university ranking systems, such as
the Leiden Ranking indicators [32]. Citations may be either positive
or negative, as they can indicate support for or criticism
of the statements and results of other authors [33]. Additionally,
the generalization of a country's publication outcomes has been subject
to critique [34]. International publications frequently serve as the focus
of publicly funded research initiatives, such as those within the
European Union [35]. Although citation impact can be assessed for
international publications, it may similarly influence the country where the
research is published. Furthermore, several studies have examined the number
of publications in various languages across countries [36], providing insight
into citation patterns in different linguistic contexts.
