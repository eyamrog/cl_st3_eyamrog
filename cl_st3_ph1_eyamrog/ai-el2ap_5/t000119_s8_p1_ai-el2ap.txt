Seed germination represents a critical phase in the plant life
cycle, as it determines subsequent seedling establishment and plant development,
and is influenced by abiotic factors such as temperature, oxygen,
and water availability (Carvalho & Nakagawa, 2012). Water availability, in
particular, can limit the germination of non-dormant seeds by affecting
the percentage, rate, and uniformity of germination. Water is essential
for reserve mobilization and the release of energy through respiration,
and it also promotes the activity of enzymes and growth
regulators. Additionally, water contributes to the dilution of protoplasm, thereby
facilitating metabolic processes necessary for the resumption of embryonic growth
(Marcos Filho, 2015).
