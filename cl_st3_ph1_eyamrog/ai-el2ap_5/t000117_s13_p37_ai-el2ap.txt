It is essential to prioritize efforts aimed at extending educational
activities beyond traditional classroom settings, recognizing that a wide variety
of environments—including schoolyards, gardens, fields, animal farms, springs, beaches, dunes,
open fields, and other local surroundings such as neighborhoods, cities,
geographic formations, historical sites, and natural landscapes—can serve as valuable
contexts for learning. In addition to providing opportunities for free
play and relaxation, these spaces can be utilized as environments
for storytelling, artistic expression, and the development of diverse forms
of knowledge (Barros, 2018, p. 23).
