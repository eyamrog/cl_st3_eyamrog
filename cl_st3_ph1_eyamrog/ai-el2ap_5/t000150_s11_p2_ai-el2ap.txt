In the context of transnational machinery, as discussed by Bauböck
and Faist (2010), the primary issues concern the processes and
consequences of migrants living across two or more countries simultaneously,
particularly with regard to the political and sociological implications of
dual engagement. Although the field of transnationalism encompasses a wide
and uneven range of concerns, the family consistently emerges as
a central and preferred mechanism facilitating this dual affiliation. However,
similar to network theories, the family functions as one component
within the broader system that connects distinct national realities, mediates
between national policies and migrants’ rights, and contributes to the
formation of national authority, patterns of discrimination, and the overall
structure of the world-system.
