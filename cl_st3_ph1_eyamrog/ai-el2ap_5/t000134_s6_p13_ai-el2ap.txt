Species of the family Hylodidae, including the genera Crossodactylus, Hylodes,
and Megaelosia, are rheophilic and endemic to the Atlantic Forest
(Laia & Rocha 2012), where they are typically found in
well-preserved forest fragments (e.g., Santos-Pereira et al. 2016; Malagoli et
al. 2017). These species exhibit a strong association with this
environment and rely on streams for all stages of their
life cycle (eggs, tadpoles, and adults), rendering them susceptible to
the loss of riparian forest (Almeida-Gomes et al. 2014b). Their
conservation is of particular concern because their effective area of
occupancy is generally limited to watercourses, which represent a small
proportion of the total forest area, thereby increasing their vulnerability
to extinction (Almeida-Gomes et al. 2014b).
