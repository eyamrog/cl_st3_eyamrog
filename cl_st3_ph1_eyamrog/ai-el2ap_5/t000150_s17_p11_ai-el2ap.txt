In Japan, evidence suggests that kinship structures are integrating elements
that were previously distinct in Brazil. Two different forms of
kinship organization can be observed, with migration serving as the
primary catalyst for these changes. The adaptation to new living
conditions in Japan has resulted in the emergence of new
kinship patterns. Consequently, a family of Okinawan descent in Brazil
differs significantly from its counterpart in contemporary Japan. Migration has
led to the development of distinct kinship systems, which now
have a substantial impact on both those who have migrated
to Japan and those who have remained in Brazil. As
Kubota notes, individuals who remain in Brazil tend to reorganize
their social relationships, placing greater emphasis on neighborhood ties rather
than blood relations. Members of families affected by emigration often
form new familial groups. This process appears to give rise
to a third kinship system, which continues to reflect certain
distinctions between Okinawan and Japanese identities.
