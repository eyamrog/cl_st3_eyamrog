This species was originally described by Grunow (1880: 21) as
Achnanthes exigua and was subsequently transferred to Achnanthidium exiguum by
Czarnecki (1994: 157). However, Taylor et al. (2014) noted that
the type specimen of A. exiguum exhibits significant morphological differences
compared to members of Achnanthidium, indicating that the transfer based
solely on raphe structure was not justified. Based on morphological
characteristics such as a sigmoid raphe with distal ends curving
in opposite directions, uniseriate striae, and specific valve shape, Kulikovskiy
et al. (2020) transferred the species to the genus Gogorevia.
In the present study, the species was found in 5%
of all core samples, with a maximum relative abundance of
1.5%, and was recorded from the Late Holocene (~1,514 cal.
yr BP). Although the species was previously reported from the
Brazilian Amazon in the Negro River as Achnanthidium exiguum (Grunow)
Czarnecki, this study represents the first record for the country
under its currently accepted name.
