Fifty judges from traditional rural communities in Mossoró, RN, were
randomly selected to participate in an acceptability test evaluating the
effectiveness of an L. ferrea-based disinfectant at a concentration of
100 mg/mL, as previously demonstrated in in vitro studies (Pagani
et al., 2015). An adapted hedonic scale, based on Pagani
et al. (2015) and Beserra et al. (2003), was used
to assess two surfaces: one treated with a commonly used
disinfectant and the other with a disinfectant derived from jucá
leaves. Each judge received a questionnaire for sensory evaluation, employing
a nine-point scale ranging from "extremely liked" to "extremely disliked"
for each attribute assessed, including aroma, color, texture, and surface
appearance.
