Serra da Bocaina, which forms part of the Serra do
Mar mountain range, is situated along the border between the
states of SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro in southeastern
Brazil. This region comprises extensive areas of well-preserved Atlantic Rainforest,
encompassing various physiognomic formations such as lowland forests, cloud forests,
and high-altitude grasslands. The area is characterized by significant physical
heterogeneity, including considerable topographical variation from sea level to 2,088
meters, steep slopes, and mountainous highlands, as well as high
annual precipitation averaging approximately 1,700 mm. These environmental factors have
likely contributed to the formation of distinct ecological niches and
refugia, resulting in elevated levels of biological diversity and endemism
(IBAMA 2002, Freitas 2010).
