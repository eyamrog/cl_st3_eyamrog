Data adjustment and analysis were conducted using SPSS (Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences, version 23). Descriptive analyses, including absolute
and percentage frequencies, means, and standard deviations, were used to
obtain the final scores of the instruments. Four binomial logistic
regression models employing the Backward LR method were applied to
estimate the effects of the independent variables—sex, skin color, education,
living alone, presence of chronic illness, age (categorized by quartiles:
up to 24 years, 25–30 years, 31–39 years, and over
39 years), income, health perception, and meta-worry (dichotomized at the
mean as above the mean and up to the mean)—on
symptoms of anxiety and depression.
