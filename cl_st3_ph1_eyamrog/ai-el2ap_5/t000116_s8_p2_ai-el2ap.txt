Despite the publication of the policy, Rio de Janeiro, the
second largest city in Brazil, did not implement it citywide
initially, but rather targeted areas characterized by extreme poverty and
lack of healthcare services. By 2009, only 7% of the
population had access to Family Health Strategy (FHS) services. In
response to this limited coverage, the city government launched the
Primary Health Care Reform (RCAPS) in 2009. Between late 2009
and 2016, substantial investment in primary health care resulted in
the expansion of services and an increase in population coverage
to 60%. However, in 2017, the Brazilian Ministry of Health
released a revised version of the National Primary Health Care
Policy, introducing numerous conceptual and operational changes, most of which
were regarded as detrimental to the sustainability of the FHS.
