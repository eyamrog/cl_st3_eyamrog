A plausible explanation for the association between the Board and
governance is that donors perceive the Board as a critical
entity for ensuring the separation of control and management (Fama
and Jensen, 1983). The Board is responsible for overseeing management
activities, thereby mitigating the risk of agents acting in their
own interests rather than those of the principals.
