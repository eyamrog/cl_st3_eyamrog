To estimate the costs associated with course readings in this
set of syllabuses, the average page count for each type
of reading was calculated (see Table 6). The analysis indicates
that students were assigned an average of 82.6 pages per
syllabus for all readings. Given that students typically enroll in
8.2 courses per year, this results in an annual total
of 677.6 pages of assigned readings per student. Using the
Access Copyright annual tariff approved by the Copyright Board of
Canada, which is $14.31 per student, the cost per page
for assigned readings across all types is approximately $0.021.
