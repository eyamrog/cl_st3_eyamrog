The lack of a unified database that consolidates the strategies
implemented by each state and facilitates comparative analysis hinders effective
public management. While many states have developed reopening plans that
include clearly defined, documented, and publicly communicated indicators—particularly regarding viral
transmission and healthcare system capacity—other important parameters, such as testing
rates and the regionalization of interventions, have been insufficiently addressed.
Despite the critical need for coordinated economic recovery planning, most
reopening plans have not met adequate standards, resulting in decision-making
processes that lack transparency and do not fully adhere to
democratic principles, thereby increasing the risk of inconsistent and potentially
ineffective public health responses.
