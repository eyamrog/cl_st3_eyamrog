According to Wetzel et al. (2015), Naviculadicta sassiana Metzeltin &
Lange-Bertalot (1998) was originally described from the Amazonian region (Tapajós
River, Brazil) and was subsequently transferred to the genus Sellaphora
based on light microscopy illustrations provided by Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot
(1998). In the present study, Sellaphora sassiana was identified in
5% of the core samples, with a maximum relative abundance
of 9.6%. This species was detected in samples corresponding to
the Late Holocene (~408 calibrated years BP). Although the species
has previously been reported from Brazil, specifically from the Tapajós
River as Naviculadicta sassiana (e.g., Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot 1998), this
study represents the first record of the taxon in the
country under its currently accepted name.
