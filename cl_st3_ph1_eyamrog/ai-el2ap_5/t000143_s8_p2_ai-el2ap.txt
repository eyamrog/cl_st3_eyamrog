Brazil ranks fifth globally in femicide rates, following El Salvador,
Colombia, Guatemala, and Russia. The Map of Violence in Brazil
(2015) documented an increase in female deaths due to aggression
between 1980 and 2013, with mortality rates rising from 2.3
to 4.8 per 100,000 women. This upward trend has persisted,
as indicated by the 2019 edition of the Atlas of
Violence in Brazil, which reported approximately 13 female homicides by
aggression per day in 2017, totaling 4,936 cases—the highest annual
figure since 2007. Between 2007 and 2017, the number of
women murdered by aggression increased by 30.7%, with a 6.3%
rise observed between 2016 and 2017. In 2017, the northeastern
region exhibited particularly high rates of female homicides by aggression,
with Rio Grande do Norte (67.4 per 100,000), Ceará (64.0),
Pernambuco (62.3), Sergipe (58.9), Bahia (55.3), Alagoas (53.9), Paraíba (33.9),
Maranhão (31.9), and Piauí (20.9) reporting the highest rates. Notably,
Sergipe experienced the largest increase in the femicide rate among
Brazilian states, with a 163.9% rise per 100,000 women between
2017 and 2018.
