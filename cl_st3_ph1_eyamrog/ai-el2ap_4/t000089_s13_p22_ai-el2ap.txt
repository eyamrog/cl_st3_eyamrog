In Ireland, although the Learn Together curriculum implemented in Educate
Together schools exhibits specific characteristics in both its theoretical structure
and local applications that complicate its classification within established modalities
of religious education, certain elements reflect a pragmatist or postmodern
approach to religion. The curriculum is organized into four strands:
Moral and Spiritual, Equality and Justice, Belief Systems, and Ethics
and the Environment. These strands are unified by the overarching
aim of fostering an understanding of diverse worldviews and developing
pupils’ critical skills for ethical decision-making. Among these, the ‘Belief
Systems’ strand is the primary component addressing religious topics, and
it was developed to cover the principal religions represented in
Ireland—Judaism, Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism, and Buddhism—by examining their origins,
doctrines, symbols, and celebrations.
