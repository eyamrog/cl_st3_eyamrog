Within the scope of ecological indices, the biological diversity observed
in this study was high compared to values reported in
areas affected by anthropogenic activities. In such impacted regions, Diptera
and Oligochaeta, which are highly tolerant to contaminants, are typically
the most prevalent taxa (Beghelli et al., 2012; Taniwaki &
Smith, 2011). The Shannon diversity index values recorded at the
three sampling sites were similar to those reported by Rosa
et al. (2011) for the Poço D'Anta Biological Reserve in
Minas Gerais. However, species richness was lower than that observed
in muddy sediments. This can be attributed to the hydrological
regime of the Itinguçu River and the sediment texture, which
are less favorable for the development of macrobenthic communities compared
to environments with fine sand or muddy sediments and more
stable conditions (Hynes, 1970; Rosa et al., 2011). Additionally, the
high equitability values suggest good water quality, as equitability tends
to decrease in degraded environments. The data obtained in this
study therefore support the conclusion that the Itinguçu River exhibits
good water quality in the region of the Cachoeira do
Paraíso waterfall (Silveira, 2004). This assessment is further corroborated by
the biological indices calculated (CETESB, 2019), which classified all three
sampling sites as having excellent quality. Nevertheless, it is important
to note that sampling was conducted in 2020 during the
COVID-19 pandemic, when visitor access was restricted, and thus the
results should be interpreted with caution. Ongoing biomonitoring is recommended
to determine whether these conditions persist following the return of
visitors, particularly at sites P2 and P3 (Gouveia, 2014). Such
studies would contribute to identifying the factors that most significantly
influence the structure of the benthic macrofauna community in the
Cachoeira do Paraíso waterfall.
