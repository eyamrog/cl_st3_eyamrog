This research project profile aims to integrate information and communication
technologies (ICT) into the resolution of authentic socio-educational challenges. The
project will identify specific educational contexts where socio-economic or cultural
barriers impede learning outcomes and will implement targeted ICT interventions
to address these issues. The research will employ a mixed-methods
approach, combining quantitative data on educational performance and access with
qualitative insights from stakeholders, including students, educators, and community members.
The effectiveness of ICT integration will be evaluated based on
measurable improvements in educational equity, engagement, and achievement. The project
will also assess the scalability and sustainability of the proposed
ICT solutions, with the objective of informing policy and practice
in similar socio-educational environments.
