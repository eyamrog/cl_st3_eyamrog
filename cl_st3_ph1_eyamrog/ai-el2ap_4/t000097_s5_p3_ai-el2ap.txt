Regarding interventions involving walking, study protocols have demonstrated that walking
can be an effective method for improving cardiorespiratory fitness and
physical performance, as well as being a safe and beneficial
intervention for women with lymphedema resulting from breast cancer. Walking
is also characterized by its accessibility and low cost, and
it can serve as a practical means of transportation, which
makes it a particularly viable option in low- and middle-income
countries. Additionally, High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) exercises have been
recommended in study protocols by Tsuji et al. and Oberste
et al., and this modality has also been investigated in
breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, with studies reporting positive effects.
