This study presents a floristic survey and analysis of the
distribution of diatoms identified in two sediment cores from the
Xingu River, Par√° State, northern Brazil, covering the past approximately
6,000 calibrated years before present (cal yr BP). A total
of thirty-eight taxa, representing twenty genera, were recorded; of these,
five taxa are new records for Brazil and nineteen are
new for the Brazilian Amazon. The genus Gomphonema Ehrenberg was
the most species-rich, with six species identified. The new records
reported here represent a 75% increase in the total number
of diatom records for the Brazilian Amazon, indicating that this
region has been insufficiently studied and that its diatom biodiversity
is likely underestimated. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of paleolimnological
methods for assessing historical biodiversity prior to significant anthropogenic impacts
on the region.
