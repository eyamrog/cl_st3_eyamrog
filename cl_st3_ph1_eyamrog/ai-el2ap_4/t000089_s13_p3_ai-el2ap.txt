According to the HAI, public schools should promote social cohesion
by imparting shared values that reflect the needs of all
citizens and groups within the country. Religious education (RE) should
be strictly informative and based on the comparative study of
both religious and non-religious worldviews. The HAI strongly opposes the
denominational model, which it argues exacerbates divisions within Irish society,
particularly by segregating pupils during RE classes. Instead, the HAI
advocates for a model of RE that is accessible to
all students and does not infringe upon their fundamental rights,
with confessional instruction restricted to outside regular school hours.
