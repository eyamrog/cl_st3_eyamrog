Emily is depicted with Daddy and Dad engaging in drawing
and painting activities on the following page. Dad is positioned
on the right, which is typically associated with the most
salient information, and is shown drawing beside Emily. Daddy is
located on the left, standing and observing the painting and
drawing. On the subsequent page, the written text appears alongside
a visual depiction of Papa’s elbow on the left and
two cups of tea with a kettle on the right.
This page references various activities that Emily undertakes with her
family. The phrase “Craft with paint and string,” which directly
relates to the visual action on the previous page, is
mentioned near the end of the written text. The text
itself is centrally positioned on the wall.
