As stated in the Introduction, the purpose of this study
is to determine: (a) how ambiguity resolution strategies differ among
English, Spanish, and Portuguese; (b) how L2 learners are influenced
by their L1 in ambiguity resolution; and whether (c) the
order of main and subordinate clauses, (d) the salience of
the anaphor, or (e) the lexical choice of verbs affect
this process.
