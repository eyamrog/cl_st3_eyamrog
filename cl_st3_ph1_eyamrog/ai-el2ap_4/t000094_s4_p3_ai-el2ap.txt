The picturebook analyzed contributes to the representation and normalization of
two-father families. It supports the inclusion and empowerment of students
from such family structures. Additionally, the book encourages students from
traditional family backgrounds to develop respect for and openness toward
diverse family configurations, thereby facilitating potential cultural and social change.
By presenting alternatives to traditional family models, the book reflects
the increasing prevalence of varied family structures. Children who engage
with this text are exposed to values of equality and
the promotion of rights regardless of sexual orientation. As a
result, the picturebook enhances curriculum inclusivity, particularly benefiting children who
may be concerned about the acceptance of their family type.
