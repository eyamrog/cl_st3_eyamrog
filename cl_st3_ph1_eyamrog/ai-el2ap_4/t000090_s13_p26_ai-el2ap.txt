Table 2 presents the distribution of data obtained from independent
sources and data provided by academic institutions. Of the total
indicators, 22 (61.11%) were collected through questionnaires, while 14 indicators
(38.89%) were sourced independently. This distribution demonstrates a substantial reliance
of the ranking results on data reported by academic institutions.
Consequently, the completeness of the database is critical, and the
applicability of “U-Multirank” varies across geographic regions due to significant
differences in data availability among countries. Analysis by dimension reveals
that “Teaching and Learning” relies entirely on institutional data, with
no indicators sourced from open data. In contrast, “Research” and
“Knowledge Transfer” have 54.55% and 55.56% of their indicators, respectively,
derived from open sources. “International Orientation” and “Regional Engagement” have
lower proportions, with 16.67% and 33.33% of their data, respectively,
obtained from open sources. Therefore, it is recommended that additional
efforts be made to encourage institutions to provide comprehensive data.
