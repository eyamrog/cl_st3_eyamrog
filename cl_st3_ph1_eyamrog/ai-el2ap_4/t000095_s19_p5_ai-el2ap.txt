Sensitivity analyses (Table 5) were conducted by excluding the last
two months of notifications to account for delays in data
management in Rio de Janeiro, and by considering all missing
cases for the variable "evolution" as non-cases, which is expected
to provide a more conservative estimate. In both scenarios, the
analyses demonstrated a consistent pattern of substantial disparities in mortality
in Rio de Janeiro.
