When children read picturebooks such as the one analyzed in
this article, they are introduced to diverse family structures during
their socialization process. The depiction of the protagonist, a girl,
engaging in everyday activities with her two fathers—such as cooking,
playing, and running—activities that are commonly associated with children in
heterosexual-parent families, contributes to the normalization of same-sex parent families.
This representation supports the acceptance of alternative family models and
promotes the normalization of diverse family forms. Additionally, the balanced
portrayal of activities occurring both inside and outside the home
further reinforces the depiction of the family’s everyday life as
typical and unremarkable.
