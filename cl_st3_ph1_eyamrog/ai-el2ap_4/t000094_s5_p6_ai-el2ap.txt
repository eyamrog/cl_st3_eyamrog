Following Emilyâ€™s introduction of her family at the beginning of
the book, the narrative depicts the various activities she engages
in with each of her fathers individually. Instances in which
Emily appears with both fathers simultaneously are relatively infrequent, occurring
on only 7 out of the 24 pages of the
picturebook, which represents approximately 29.16% of the total pages.
