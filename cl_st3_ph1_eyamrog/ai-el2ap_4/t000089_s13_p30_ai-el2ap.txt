Erricker adopts Derridaâ€™s concept of iterability, understood as the re-appropriation
of meanings within discourse, to emphasize the constructive nature of
religious narratives. As individuals reinterpret religious doctrines based on their
personal perspectives and requirements, the role of the religious educator
should not be to transmit predetermined moral teachings or promote
fixed values. Rather, educators are encouraged to facilitate dialogical processes
that enable students to determine the relevance and significance of
religious narratives for themselves, drawing upon diverse experiences of the
religious phenomenon.
