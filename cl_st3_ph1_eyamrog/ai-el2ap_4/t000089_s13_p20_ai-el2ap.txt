For these reasons, an ethical-dialogical approach that considers the ways
in which religion is experienced by members of the major
religious traditions, as well as by adherents of minority faiths
in specific local contexts, is preferable to a neutralist model
that prioritizes breadth over depth. This approach allows the syllabus
to address not only general ethical questions but also issues
that are particularly relevant to the local community. In this
framework, students can work toward mutual understanding, supported by the
syllabus and guided by the teacher, by engaging in discussions
about the significance of their religious beliefs and the ways
in which these beliefs may influence their actions. Given the
experiential nature of learning, the inclusion of intercultural activities, such
as educational visits to museums and places of worship, is
also recommended within this model.
