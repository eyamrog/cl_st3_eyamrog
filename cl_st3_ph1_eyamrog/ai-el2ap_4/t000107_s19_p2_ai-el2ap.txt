A search using the keyword "tradução" (translation) on the Domínio
Público website retrieved 218 theses and dissertations. Analysis of the
titles indicated that only four of these were theses related
to the field of medical translation, and no dissertations on
medical translation were identified. These findings were confirmed through a
review of the abstracts for all 218 works. The flowchart
in Figure 4 summarizes these results, demonstrating that although the
keyword "tradução" yielded 218 entries, only four (1.8%) met the
selection criteria for medical translation.
