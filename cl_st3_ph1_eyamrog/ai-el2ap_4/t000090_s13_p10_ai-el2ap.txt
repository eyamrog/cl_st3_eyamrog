There are several methods for generating an overall ranking using
“U-Multirank.” When requested, “U-Multirank” employs a classification approach similar to
the “Olympic Medals Table,” in which institutions are ranked primarily
by the number of highest scores (A) they receive, with
scores of B and below used only as tiebreakers. As
a result, an institution with 20 “A” scores and 16
“E” scores would be ranked higher than an institution with
19 “A” scores and 17 “B” scores. This ranking method
is problematic because it minimizes the distinction between “B” and
“E” scores. In extreme cases, this approach may incentivize institutions
to concentrate their efforts on a limited set of indicators
while neglecting others, potentially leading to suboptimal outcomes for students
in certain areas.
