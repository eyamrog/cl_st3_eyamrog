This proposal is aligned with the Constitution of the Republic
of Ecuador, specifically Article 347, which establishes the state's responsibility
to incorporate information and communication technologies (ICT) into the educational
process and to promote the integration of teaching with productive
or social activities (Asamblea Constituyente del Ecuador, 2008, p. 161).
In this context, the proposed master's program aims to contribute
by preparing educators to design, coordinate, and implement projects that
integrate ICT across all educational levels in Ecuador. Consequently, the
program advocates for an open and flexible curricular design that
facilitates ongoing updates and innovation, while also providing guidance for
teachers in applying evidence-based and replicable technological practices, grounded in
verified cases of success relevant to the local context.
