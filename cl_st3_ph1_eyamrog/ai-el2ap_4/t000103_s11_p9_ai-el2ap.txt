The preceding examples are unambiguous, allowing for straightforward identification of
the anaphor’s antecedent. However, if the name Mary is replaced
with Peter, as in example (5), it becomes less clear
whether individuals would interpret the anaphor’s antecedent as the subject
or the complement of the main clause, or potentially as
a different referent not explicitly mentioned in the sentence.
