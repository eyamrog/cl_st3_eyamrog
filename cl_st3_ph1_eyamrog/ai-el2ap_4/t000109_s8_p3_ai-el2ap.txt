Much of the existing literature on epidemic modeling and simulation,
particularly in the context of COVID-19, employs global models based
on SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered) differential equations or similar
frameworks, with various adaptations specific to the disease [14][15]. In
contrast, the epidemic modeling community has also utilized local or
fine-grained approaches [16], including agent-based models (ABM) [10][13][17][18], such as
the one implemented in this study. These models offer increased
expressiveness and control over various aspects of epidemic dynamics, facilitate
the incorporation of stochastic elements, and enable detailed spatiotemporal monitoring
of simulation outcomes [10][11][19]. However, they typically require greater computational
resources and access to extensive local data to be effectively
tailored to specific scenarios.
