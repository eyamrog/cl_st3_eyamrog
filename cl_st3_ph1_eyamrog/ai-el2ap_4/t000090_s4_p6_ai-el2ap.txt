Analysis of the "top 300 performers" in Europe in 2020
indicates that the Dimensions and Indicators selected by U-Multirank constitute
an effective set of criteria for evaluating academic institutions, with
minimal redundancy among the measurements. The multidimensional approach implemented by
U-Multirank is particularly significant, as most institutions do not exhibit
uniform performance across all dimensions; consequently, aggregate rankings would obscure
substantial differences in institutional strengths and weaknesses.
