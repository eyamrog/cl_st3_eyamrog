The incidence of COVID-19 among vaccinated individuals was calculated by
dividing the number of COVID-19 positive cases in the vaccinated
group by the total number of vaccinated individuals and multiplying
the result by 100. Similarly, the incidence of COVID-19 in
the unvaccinated group was determined by dividing the number of
COVID-19 positive cases in the unvaccinated group by the total
number of unvaccinated individuals and multiplying by 100. Confidence intervals
for these incidence estimates were constructed using the exact Clopper-Pearson
method (Desu and Raghavarao, 2003).
