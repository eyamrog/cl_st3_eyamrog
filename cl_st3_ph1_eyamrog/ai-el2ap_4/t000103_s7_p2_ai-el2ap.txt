This study builds upon previous research (Bruscato & Baptista, 2022a,
2022b) by comparing ambiguity resolution in English, Spanish, and Portuguese,
which are identified as the three most widely spoken European
languages globally (Eberhard et al., 2020). The primary objectives are
to examine: (a) the differences in ambiguity resolution strategies among
English, Spanish, and Portuguese; (b) the extent to which L2
learners' ambiguity resolution is influenced by their first language; and
(c) the potential effects of main and subordinate clause order,
(d) anaphor salience, and (e) verb lexical choice on ambiguity
resolution processes.
