All participants completed a 10-item presurvey prior to the start
of the course. The presurvey included four demographic questions (name,
location, age, and gender) and six items using a 5-point
Likert scale to assess participants’ attitudes toward the use of
mobile devices in teaching and learning. After the 8-week course,
participants completed a postsurvey consisting of three questions evaluating their
readiness to use and apply mobile devices for teaching and
learning. Both pre- and postsurvey items were selected from the
Mobile Learning Survey, which was originally adapted by Gunter and
Reeves (2017) to assess teachers’ attitudes toward online professional development
incorporating mobile learning. The internal consistency reliability for the attitude
items was acceptable, with Cronbach’s alpha coefficients of .70 for
the presurvey and .77 for the postsurvey (Gunter & Reeves,
2017).
