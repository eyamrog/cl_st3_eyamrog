Water quality is determined by a combination of physical, chemical,
and biological variables. While physical and chemical parameters are important,
point measurements of these variables provide only instantaneous data, which
may not accurately reflect the overall water quality. In contrast,
resident organisms can serve as long-term indicators of water quality
(Gorni and Alves, 2012). The physical and chemical parameters measured
in the Itinguçu River were within the normal ranges established
by federal standards for protected areas (Class 1 waters) and
were consistent with values reported in the literature for environments
characterized by good water quality (Lutz, 1968; Yanoviak, 1999a; Hrovat
et al., 2009; Monteiro et al., 2008; Taniwaki and Smith,
2011; Tszydel et al., 2015). Furthermore, these values were similar
to those observed in rivers within the Intervales State Park,
São Paulo (Alves et al., 2008; Melo, 2009).
