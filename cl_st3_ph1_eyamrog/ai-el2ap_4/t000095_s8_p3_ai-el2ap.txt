By June 2021, the total number of reported COVID-19 cases
in the state of São Paulo was five times higher
than that reported in the state of Rio de Janeiro,
while the population of São Paulo is approximately 2.6 times
larger (about 44 million compared to 17 million inhabitants). Consequently,
a comparative analysis of the two states and their respective
capitals regarding the characteristics and progression of hospitalized patients and
COVID-19-related deaths may provide insights into the elevated mortality rates
observed in the state of Rio de Janeiro.
