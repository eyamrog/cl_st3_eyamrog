The timing of sample collection following exposure is a variable
that may influence the detection of positive cases in serological
population studies. This factor may account for the differences in
seroprevalence observed between the cities of Mariana and Ouro Preto
in the present study. The prevalence rates identified in these
two cities in the Inconfidentes region during October to December
2020 were higher than those reported in a population-based survey
conducted in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil,
from April 11 to May 11, 2020, which found a
prevalence of less than 1% [27]. Conversely, the results from
Mariana and Ouro Preto are similar to those observed in
states in the northeastern region of Brazil during a national
household survey conducted between May 14 and June 7, 2020,
which demonstrated substantial heterogeneity in the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies
across different regions of Brazil [28].
