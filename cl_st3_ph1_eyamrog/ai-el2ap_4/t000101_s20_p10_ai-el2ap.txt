As shown in the table below, staff turnover persisted during
the Bolsonaro administration, with only 30.97% of respondents indicating that
they remained in the same position and institution since the
2018 elections. Exit from previous roles occurred in various forms:
some individuals transferred to different departments, as certain career paths
limit movement between institutions; others took temporary leave for educational
purposes. Additionally, some respondents requested transfers to different agencies or
cities, while a small number sought unpaid leave to work
outside the public sector or in another country.
