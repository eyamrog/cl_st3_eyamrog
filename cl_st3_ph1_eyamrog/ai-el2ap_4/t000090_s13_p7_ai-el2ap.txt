Figure 1 presents the classical framework summarizing the results of
the “U-Multirank” (https://www.umultirank.org/export/sites/default/press-media/media-center/universities/2020/country-reports/UK-Country-report-2020.pdf). The diagram illustrates the five ranking dimensions:
Teaching and Learning (green), Research (pink), Knowledge Transfer (blue), International
Orientation (orange), and Regional Engagement (purple). Each dimension is further
subdivided into specific indicators as follows. Teaching and Learning includes:
(1) Bachelor graduation rate, (2) Master graduation rate, (3) On-time
graduation (bachelor), and (4) On-time graduation (master). Research comprises: (5)
External research income, (6) Size-normalized research publications, (7) Art-related output,
(8) Citation rate, (9) Top-cited publications, (10) Interdisciplinary publications, and
(11) Postdoctoral positions. Knowledge Transfer consists of: (12) Income from
private sources, (13) Co-publications with industrial partners, (14) Size-normalized patents
awarded, (15) Industry co-patents, (16) Spin-offs, (17) Publications cited in
patents, and (18) Income from continuous professional development. International Orientation
includes: (19) Foreign language bachelor programmes, (20) Foreign language master
programmes, (21) Student mobility, (22) International academic staff, (23) International
doctorate degrees, and (24) International joint publications. Regional Engagement comprises:
(25) Bachelor graduates employed in the region, (26) Student internships
in the region, (27) Regional joint publications, (28) Income from
regional sources, and (29) Master graduates employed in the region.
Further methodological details and calculation procedures for each indicator are
available in the U-Multirank Indicator Book (https://www.umultirank.org/export/sites/default/press-media/documents/Indicator-Book-2020.pdf).
