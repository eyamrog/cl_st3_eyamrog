This scoping review aimed to identify and characterize physical activity
and/or exercise intervention study protocols for breast cancer treatment by
detailing the types, frequency, duration, intensity, and timing of the
interventions, as well as reporting the outcomes assessed. Seventeen protocol
studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, all of
which were randomized clinical trials registered on official platforms. Given
that protocol studies do not present results, the assessment of
risk of bias was adapted accordingly. The included study protocols
adhered to the SPIRIT checklist, and evaluation indicated a low
risk of bias due to clear reporting of random sequence
generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and researchers, and selective
reporting, in accordance with the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool.
