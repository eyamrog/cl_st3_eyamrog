Among the most representative botanical families of the Atlantic Domain,
Melastomataceae is notable, comprising a total of 510 taxa (Flora
do Brasil 2020). The genus Pleroma D. Don, belonging to
Melastomataceae, includes approximately 160 species with a Neotropical distribution, occurring
primarily in the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado domains and only
rarely in the Caatinga (Guimarães et al. 2019). Of these,
only five species extend into the northwest and west regions
of South America (Freitas et al. 2013; Fraga and Guimarães
2014; Oliveira et al. 2014; Guimarães et al. 2019). Historically,
this group was treated as synonymous with the genus Tibouchina
Aublet sensu Cogniaux (1885, 1891). However, based on morphological, molecular,
and geographic distribution data, Tibouchina was subsequently divided into four
well-supported genera (Michelangeli et al. 2013; Guimarães et al. 2019),
with Tibouchina sensu stricto now comprising only 35 taxa restricted
to Cerrado environments (Silva et al. 2014; Guimarães 2014; Guimarães
et al. 2019). The Tibouchina species occurring in eastern Brazil
were reassigned to two distinct genera, Pleroma and Chaetogastra DC.
(Guimarães et al. 2019).
