When Bolsonaro assumed office on January 1, 2019, he inherited
a large, professional, and well-established federal administration. The Brazilian federal
state had demonstrated its capacity by implementing Bolsa Família, the
world’s largest conditional cash transfer program, which reached 14 million
low-income families (Morais de Sá e Silva, 2017). Brazil also
maintains a universal health system (SUS) that provides free healthcare
services, including comprehensive immunization, to all citizens nationwide. Additionally, the
country has a network of 69 federal universities that offer
free, high-quality undergraduate and graduate education. The range of institutions
and policies is considerable, and while none are without shortcomings,
many have achieved sufficient success to attract international attention and
serve as models for experience-sharing with other countries in the
Global South (Porto de Oliveira, 2019).
