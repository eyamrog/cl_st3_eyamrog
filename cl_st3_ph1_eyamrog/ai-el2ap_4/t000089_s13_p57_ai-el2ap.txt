When considering faith formation, two key issues should be addressed
from the perspective of reflective, dialogical rationality. First, the distribution
of denominational and non-denominational schools within a given region or
country must be considered to ensure that parental rights regarding
their childrenâ€™s specific upbringing are protected. Given the compulsory nature
of primary education, the state has a responsibility to provide
schools that accommodate all children in the local community, taking
into account the religious and non-religious backgrounds of their parents.
By prioritizing geographical factors over religious affiliation in access to
public education, the state can promote equitable opportunities for democratic
participation in an educational environment where religious traditions and ethical
values are acknowledged, and all students are able to engage
in the pursuit of truth and moral inquiry at both
cognitive and communal levels.
