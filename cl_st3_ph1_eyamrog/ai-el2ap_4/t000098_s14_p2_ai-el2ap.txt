The age-adjusted COVID-19 mortality rate in country i, denoted as
ai, is defined as the COVID-19 mortality rate in country
i that has been standardized to account for differences in
the age composition of the populations across countries. This adjustment
enables more accurate comparisons of mortality rates by controlling for
variations in age distribution, which is a significant factor influencing
COVID-19 mortality. The age-adjusted rate is calculated using standard demographic
techniques, such as direct or indirect standardization, to ensure that
observed differences in mortality are not attributable to disparities in
population age structures.
