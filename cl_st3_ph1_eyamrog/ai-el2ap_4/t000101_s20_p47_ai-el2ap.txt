Conditions deteriorated during the Temer administration, but the situation worsened
significantly under Bolsonaro. There appears to be a persistent capacity
for further decline, resulting in a heightened sense of institutional
fragility. The primary distinction is the nature of the fear
experienced by public servants. Previously, concerns were mainly related to
professional consequences, such as the potential loss of senior positions
or the risk of stigmatization. Currently, however, there is a
pronounced fear of actual persecution. For example, after delivering a
presentation on a proposed constitutional amendment, the interviewee was contacted
by the organizer, who expressed concern due to the intervieweeâ€™s
critical stance on current fiscal policies. The interviewee acknowledged the
prevailing atmosphere of fear but also emphasized the continued presence
of courage among public servants (interview 51).
