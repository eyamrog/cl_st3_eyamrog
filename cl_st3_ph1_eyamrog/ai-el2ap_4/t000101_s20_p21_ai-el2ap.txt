On his third day in office, 3,500 individuals were dismissed
from their federal appointments (Batista, 2019). For those who were
not civil servants, this resulted in their departure from government
service. For civil servants, the termination of their appointments entailed
removal from senior positions, although they retained their status as
public employees. It is important to note that by the
time Bolsonaro assumed office in 2019, two and a half
years had passed since the end of the PT administration,
during which substantial bureaucratic restructuring had already taken place, as
previously indicated.
