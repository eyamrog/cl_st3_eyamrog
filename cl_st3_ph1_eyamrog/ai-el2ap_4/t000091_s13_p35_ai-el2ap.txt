Kava (also known as kava-kava) has been widely used in
recent decades. Its popularity in Western countries is primarily attributed
to its anxiolytic properties (Baek et al., 2014). The main
active constituents of kava-kava are kavapirones, also referred to as
kavalactones. In addition to its use for anxiety management, kava-kava
is employed to modulate mood, acts as a skeletal muscle
relaxant, and produces mild central nervous system depressant effects (Fajemiroye
et al., 2016).
