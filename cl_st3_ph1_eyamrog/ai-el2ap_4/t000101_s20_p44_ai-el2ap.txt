At present, there is a noticeable restriction on the freedom
of expression among civil servants, with several agencies reportedly subjecting
individuals to punitive measures for making public statements that oppose
the government. For example, one interviewee recalled previously participating in
street demonstrations, openly sharing opinions, and expressing views on social
media and during protests. However, the interviewee indicated that they
no longer engage in such activities due to a perceived
increase in surveillance, even within private forums, and cited a
tangible risk of repercussions, noting that political persecution is among
the potential consequences (interview 7).
