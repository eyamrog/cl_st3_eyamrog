Although the research makes a legitimate effort to introduce pluralism
into the curriculum, it primarily adopts a constructivist perspective to
emphasize the fluidity of national identities and to critique educational
policies that seek to instill specific, and often contentious, political
values. The report provides a compelling argument for revising the
History Curriculum to better reflect the contributions of minority groups
to national development; for example, the authors reference Peter Fryer
to demonstrate that the significant roles played by Asian, Black
African, and Caribbean individuals in both world wars are frequently
omitted from contemporary narratives (Maylor et al., 2007, p. 55).
However, the report does not propose a clear deliberative framework
for moral reasoning aimed at fostering critical thinking. In its
evaluation of current approaches to citizenship education—which in Britain remains
dispersed across various curriculum areas, including moral and spiritual education—the
report argues that defining public virtues solely in terms of
national values overlooks ongoing social struggles related to identity renegotiation.
Consequently, the authors advocate for a curriculum that prioritizes antiracism
and the study of universal human rights, while supporting the
development of multicultural identities within public life (Maylor et al.,
2007, p. 50), rather than focusing exclusively on the promotion
of common values and a unified conception of citizenship.
