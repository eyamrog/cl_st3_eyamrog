The Google search engine was found to be unreliable for
the purposes of this study due to its lack of
appropriate filtering options and the influence of user-specific algorithms, which
are primarily optimized for commercial interests and heavily influenced by
paid advertisements. Although Google offers a specialized tool for locating
scholarly literature, namely Google Scholar, this platform predominantly retrieves content
from books and scientific articles, which fall outside the scope
of the present analysis. Consequently, searches were conducted using two
Brazilian websites specifically designed to catalogue theses and dissertations produced
at Brazilian higher education institutions: www.bdtd.ibict.br/vufind/ (BDTD) and www.catalogodeteses.capes.gov.br/catalogo-teses/ (CAPES).
The CAPES website contained a larger collection of theses and
dissertations compared to both the Domínio Público and BDTD platforms.
However, the CAPES interface was less user-friendly, as filtering options
become available only after keywords are entered and these options
vary depending on the keywords used. These features render the
search process on the CAPES website more complex and time-consuming.
