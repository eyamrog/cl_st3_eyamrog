The use of emojis in WhatsApp interactions appears to support
Paivaâ€™s (2016) assertion that the increasing use of emojis represents
an effort to convey greater meaning in a more economical
manner within specific interactional contexts. The data indicate that certain
emojis functioned as signals that participants were actively following the
progression of the conversation. Additionally, the findings suggest that emojis
may serve to reinforce ideas or mitigate the impact of
certain written messages, as evidenced by their usage patterns observed
in the study.
