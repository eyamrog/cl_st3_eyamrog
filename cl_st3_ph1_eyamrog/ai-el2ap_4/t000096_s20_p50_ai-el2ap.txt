This study evaluates the significance and defining features of technological
ecosystems for learning, positioning them as alternatives to conventional Course
Management Systems (CMS), Learning Management Systems (LMS), and Learning Content
Management Systems (LCMS). Technological ecosystems for learning are characterized by
their modularity, interoperability, and capacity to integrate diverse digital tools
and resources, thereby supporting more flexible and personalized educational experiences.
Unlike traditional systems, which often operate as closed platforms with
limited adaptability, learning ecosystems facilitate dynamic interactions among various stakeholders
and technologies. The potential implementation of these ecosystems in real
educational contexts is examined with respect to their ability to
enhance learner engagement, support collaborative practices, and accommodate evolving pedagogical
needs. The analysis considers both the opportunities and challenges associated
with adopting technological ecosystems, including issues related to scalability, data
privacy, and institutional readiness.
