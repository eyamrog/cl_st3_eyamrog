Hauerwas’ assumptions do not adequately consider the potential for mutual
learning that engagement with religious lifestyles in pluralistic environments can
offer to believers. By situating a particular conception of the
good life and its associated virtues within a narrativist account
of faith, Hauerwas limits the possibility for believers to expand
their religious conceptual resources and to adapt gospel principles to
diverse social contexts. From the standpoint of intersubjective reasoning, narratives
are subject to ongoing reconstruction, which enables the reinterpretation and
application of virtues in response to changing circumstances. For example,
just as many Christians have rejected the legitimacy of slavery—a
position once supported by some slave owners in the United
States through biblical arguments, such as St. Paul’s return of
a slave to Philemon and hierarchical interpretations of spiritual and
material duties—Christians can also reconsider the significance of Christ’s passion
and the concept of self-sacrifice in varying contexts. This raises
questions such as whether Christians are categorically prohibited from using
violence, even to protect innocent lives, or whether Christ’s passion
should instead be understood as a principle guiding the avoidance
of hatred and the practice of forgiveness. Through such processes
of reflection and dialogue, both religious and secular individuals can
identify shared moral principles, while also recognizing the need for
differentiated attitudes within the Church and in pluralistic societies. For
instance, they may conclude that violence is permissible, or even
necessary, for self-defence, but that forgiveness should be prioritized over
retribution once immediate threats are eliminated and when national reconciliation
is required, as exemplified by Desmond Tutu’s (1999) articulation of
Ubuntu in South Africa.
