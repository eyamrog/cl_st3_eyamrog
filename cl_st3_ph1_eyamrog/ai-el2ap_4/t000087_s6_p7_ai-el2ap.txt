The strengths of this study include a high participation rate,
comprehensive COVID-19 testing of nearly all participants before and after
the event, and consistent event conditions for the majority of
attendees. However, the study has several limitations: it was not
possible to sequence all COVID-19 positive cases to confirm infection
with the Delta variant, and not all vaccinated individuals were
fully vaccinated at the time of the event. Further research
with larger sample sizes is necessary to assess the incidence
of COVID-19 among fully vaccinated adolescents and to determine whether
the incidence and symptom profiles in this group are comparable
to those observed in this smaller cohort.
