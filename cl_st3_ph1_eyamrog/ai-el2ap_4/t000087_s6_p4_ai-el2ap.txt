A total of 24.4% of participants reported secondary infections among
their close contacts. None of the adolescents in this study,
nor any of their SARS-CoV-2 positive close contacts, developed severe
cases, required hospitalization, or died as a result of COVID-19.
These findings are consistent with previous research indicating that COVID-19
vaccines are highly effective in preventing hospitalization and death (Mlcochova
et al., 2021; Sheikh et al., 2021). Vaccinated adolescents may
experience mild or moderate symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection, but they
generally have a lower risk of severe disease or mortality
from COVID-19 compared to older populations.
