To effectively provide a democratic space for ethical inquiry, religious
education (RE) in common schools should be guided by a
dialogical approach that critically examines the truth claims of various
traditions. It is also necessary to consider social narratives, personal
experiences, and the prior knowledge of students within the classroom
context. A common school that is inclusive of all members
of the local community, accommodates diverse cultural and religious needs,
and fosters an environment of democratic deliberation can achieve rational
accountability without compromising the moral integrity of individuals or reducing
the educational process to a purely abstract exercise that neglects
the experiential aspects of knowledge.
