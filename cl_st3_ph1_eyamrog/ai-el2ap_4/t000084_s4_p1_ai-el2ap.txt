The results indicate that emojis are predominantly used to support
cognitive, teaching, and social presence. Most of the emojis identified
in the data belong to WhatsApp’s categories of face emojis,
people, and gestures. These findings suggest that communication within social
networks is increasingly visual and multimodal, as evidenced by the
use of emojis and, more recently, stickers, as noted by
Paiva (2016); a similar trend is observed with the widespread
use of gifs in social media. Consistent with Paiva’s perspective,
the data support the view that language social practices occur
in a complex manner, influenced by the interactions among various
agents, the diverse modes of meaning-making, and the technologies that
mediate these practices.
