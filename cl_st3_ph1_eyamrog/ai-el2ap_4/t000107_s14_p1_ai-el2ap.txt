Following the methodology proposed by Alves and Vasconcellos (2016), which
utilized the website www.dominiopublico.gov.br as a data source, this study
aimed to map research on medical translation conducted in Brazil.
The search focused on identifying theses and dissertations related to
medical translation completed at Brazilian higher education institutions between 2002
and 2018, using relevant keywords in Portuguese. Initially, the study
considered the period from 2006 to 2016, as defined by
Alves and Vasconcellos (2016), who selected 2006 as the starting
point due to the implementation of administrative regulation number 13/2006
by CAPES (Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel),
which mandated that all theses and dissertations in Brazil be
made digitally available to the public through the Domínio Público
website. However, the present search identified medical translation studies completed
prior to 2006; therefore, the research period was extended to
encompass the years 2002 to 2018.
