To examine the relationship between participants’ attitudes and their use
of emojis for cognitive, teaching, and social presences, three Spearman
Rho analyses were conducted using participants’ post-survey responses (N =
61) and their emoji use for each presence. The analysis
indicated a significant positive correlation between emoji use for cognitive
presence and participants’ self-reported readiness to use mobile devices in
the language classroom (rs = .32, p = .01), suggesting
that participants who reported greater readiness to use mobile devices
also used emojis more frequently to support cognitive presence during
the course. This finding implies that increased familiarity with WhatsApp
may be associated with a greater likelihood of utilizing its
features, including emojis, to exchange information, connect ideas, and apply
new knowledge. In contrast, no significant correlations were found between
emoji use for social presence (rs = .20, p =
.12) or teaching presence (rs = -.09, p = .48)
and participants’ readiness to use mobile devices. The widespread use
of emojis in recent years may account for the similar
frequency of emoji use to facilitate collaboration and emotional expression,
regardless of participants’ attitudes. Additionally, as noted in the Teaching
Presence section, participants frequently assumed instructional roles to assist peers,
independent of their attitudes toward mobile device readiness, which may
explain the lack of correlation for teaching presence. See Table
