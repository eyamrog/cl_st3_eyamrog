The results obtained from the website were analyzed individually to
identify and select studies related to medical translation. The selected
studies were organized in an Excel spreadsheet with columns for
year, title, institution, area of knowledge, type of study, and
author. The same procedure was applied to studies filtered by
the "doutorado" (doctorate) category. Searches using both the "mestrado" (master)
and "doutorado" (doctorate) filters indicated that the website www.dominiopublico.gov.br, which
aims to provide public access to Brazilian research, is not
a reliable source for data collection. This assessment is based
on the identification of relevant works from the study period
that were not available on the Domínio Público website.
