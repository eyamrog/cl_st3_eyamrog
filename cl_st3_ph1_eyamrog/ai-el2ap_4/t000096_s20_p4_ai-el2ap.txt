In this manner, the proposed curricular design aligns with national
government policies on the integration and use of ICT in
education, as well as with the pedagogical model of UNACH
and its institutional teaching practices. At the meso-curricular level, where
curricular lines, components, and institutional areas intersect, the teaching component
of this program is supported by the relevant academic department
at UNACH responsible for teacher training, specifically the Faculty of
Education, Human Sciences, and Technologies, which provides philosophical, sociological, epistemological,
and didactic foundations.
