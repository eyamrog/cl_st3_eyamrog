Benzodiazepines are associated with certain undesirable effects during therapeutic use
(Akhondzadeh et al., 2001). In a comparative study, Passiflora incarnata
extract (45 mg/day) was evaluated against oxazepam (30 mg/day) for
the treatment of generalized anxiety. The findings indicated that while
Passiflora incarnata extract exhibited a slower onset of action compared
to oxazepam, it did not result in impairments of cognitive
function or work performance, in contrast to the effects observed
with oxazepam.
