The Itinguçu State Park (PEIT) is one of the protected
areas within the mosaic and includes the Cachoeira do Paraíso
waterfall, which is formed along the course of the Itinguçu
River. The biota of the region currently comprises 29 fish
species distributed across 12 families, as well as various insects,
lizards, squirrels, snakes, sloths, and other fauna (Magini and Abessa,
2017). The waterfall is the primary tourist attraction in the
area, with visitation peaking during the summer months. In 2008,
for instance, the site recorded 45,217 visitors (SMA, 2009), prompting
authorities to implement daily visitor limits until further studies could
determine the park’s carrying capacity (Magini and Abessa, 2017).
