From a normative perspective, policy change is considered essential for
improving social conditions, reducing inequality, and promoting sustainability. The public
policy literature on policy change is extensive and has produced
multiple conceptual frameworks that facilitate the analysis of the policy
change process. Within this body of literature, Michael Bauer and
colleagues have examined a specific form of policy change known
as "policy dismantling," which they define as the cutting, reduction,
diminution, or complete elimination of existing policies (Bauer et al.,
2012, p. v).
