This paper examines the dimensions and indicators of the academic
international multidimensional ranking system “U-Multirank.” The analysis of this ranking
is particularly relevant in the current Brazilian context, as the
new evaluation framework for graduate programs in Brazil incorporates several
aspects of multidimensional assessment, including concepts derived from U-Multirank. U-Multirank
identifies the strengths and weaknesses of academic institutions by employing
five dimensions, which are further divided into 36 indicators. While
this extensive set of dimensions and indicators provides a more
comprehensive assessment of universities, it also raises concerns regarding the
independence of the indicators and the availability of reliable data.
The study analyzes the top 300 European academic institutions listed
in the 2020 edition, describes the dimensions and indicators used,
and conducts statistical correlations among them.
