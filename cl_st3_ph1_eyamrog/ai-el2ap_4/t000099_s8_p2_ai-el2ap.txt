The cultivation of plants in sealed flasks restricts gas exchange
between the internal and external environments, resulting in the accumulation
of gases such as CO2 and O2 within the flasks
(George et al. 2008). Consequently, the gaseous composition of the
in vitro atmosphere is determined by the respiratory and photosynthetic
activities of the micropropagated plants (Chen 2006). Under photomixotrophic conditions,
which are characterized by high sugar concentrations in the culture
medium, low irradiance, high relative humidity, and limited gas exchange
due to the use of enclosed vessels, the rate of
photosynthesis is reduced, whereas respiration is less affected because of
the continuous carbon supply (Lucchesini et al. 2001; George et
al. 2008; Ševčíková et al. 2019).
