This study utilized an embedded correlational mixed methods design. As
defined by Creswell and Plano Clark (2018), an embedded approach
integrates both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis within
a primary quantitative or qualitative framework. Unlike most mixed methods
designs, the objective is not necessarily to merge the two
data sets, as they are generally employed to address distinct
research questions. In this study, quantitative data collection and analysis
were embedded within the qualitative data collection and analysis. For
the qualitative component, transcripts from the WhatsApp course were collected
and coded according to the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework.
Emoji use was examined qualitatively through the creation of emoji
word clouds, supplemented by detailed participant descriptions to support the
primary findings. Subsequently, participants’ emoji use was quantified and correlated
with their attitudes, as measured by pre- and post-survey responses.
Participants’ age was also correlated with emoji use to assess
whether age influenced emoji usage patterns. Additionally, emoji use was
compared between male and female participants to determine whether gender
had a significant effect on emoji use. The following research
questions guided this study:
