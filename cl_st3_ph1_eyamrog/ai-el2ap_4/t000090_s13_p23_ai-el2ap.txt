The initial observation concerns the presence of two indicators with
notably low data availability, each with fewer than 100 data
points (33%): “Strategic research partnerships,” which contains only missing data,
and “Industry co-patents,” which has 91 available data points, 5
missing, and 204 marked as “Not Applicable.” Given that the
remaining 34 indicators have more complete datasets, these two indicators
will be excluded from subsequent statistical analyses to minimize the
impact of extensive missing data on the results.
