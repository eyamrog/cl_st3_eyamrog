To validate the model, initial conditions and parameters associated with
host transmission in the city of Hoyo de Manzanares were
applied, as described in previous studies [9,47]. Consistent with methodologies
employed in other agent-based epidemiological models [13,48], the outputs of
AbCSim were compared with field data, demonstrating agreement between simulated
and observed results. Furthermore, the dispersion of model outputs, assessed
using the interquartile range, was found to be within acceptable
limits.
