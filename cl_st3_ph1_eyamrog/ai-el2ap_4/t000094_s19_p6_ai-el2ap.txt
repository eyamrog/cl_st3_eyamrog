Up to this point, page 20 is the only instance
in which Daddy is depicted in the illustration performing an
activity with Emily; specifically, he is shown in the background
fishing with her. On the following page, Dad is depicted
sitting on a bench with Max, observing Emily and Daddy
as they fish. The written text appears at the bottom
of the page, positioned in the foreground immediately after the
stream, which is also present in the previous illustration.
