Studies have also demonstrated that the use of Valeriana officinalis
extracts does not result in side effects such as dizziness,
gastrointestinal disturbances, allergic reactions, or paradoxical effects (Pinheiro et al.,
2014). Furthermore, Yao et al. (2007) reported that the ethanolic
extract of V. officinalis did not produce adverse effects on
embryonic development or fertility in rodents.
