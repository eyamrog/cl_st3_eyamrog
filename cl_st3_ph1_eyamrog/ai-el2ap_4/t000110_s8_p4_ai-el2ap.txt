In Brazil, floristic and taxonomic studies of sedimentary diatoms over
extended timescales remain limited. Currently, only four studies have addressed
this topic: a floristic survey and analysis of the spatial-temporal
distribution of diatoms in surface sediments and core samples spanning
approximately 90 years from an urban reservoir in the São
Paulo Metropolitan Region (Faustino et al. 2016); an investigation of
water level variations based on the abundance and distribution of
two diatom species in core samples covering roughly 830 years
from a marsh on Mutum Island in the Upper Paraná
River floodplain (Ruwer & Rodrigues 2018); a reconstruction of Holocene
paleoenvironments in the lacustrine Pinguela-Palmital-Malvas system (Hermany et al. 2013);
and an assessment of paleoecological and paleohydrological changes using five
sedimentary cores from Itupanema Beach, Pará State (Ribeiro et al.
2010).
