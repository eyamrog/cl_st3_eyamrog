Ouro Preto was founded in 1711 and designated as the
capital of the newly established province of Minas Gerais in
1720 [14]. The municipality has a Human Development Index (HDI)
of 0.741. Its primary economic activities include mining, metallurgical industries,
tourism, and services, with a significant emphasis on those associated
with the Federal Institution of Higher Education located in the
city. These sectors contribute to substantial population mobility, primarily due
to the movement of workers and students [12].
