Shrubs 1–1.5 m tall. Young branches, petioles, inflorescences, hypanthia, and
sepals are covered with strigose eglandular trichomes; stems and young
branches are 4-angled. Leaves are chartaceous; petioles measure 3–7 mm
in length; leaf blades are 0.8–4.5 × 0.5–3.2 cm, ovate,
with a subcordate base, obtuse apex, entire and ciliate margins;
the adaxial surface is strigose-sericeous, while the abaxial surface is
velutinous with hispidulous-sericeous trichomes above the midrib and lateral veins;
leaves are 5-veined, with a thinner pair of main veins
located just inside the leaf margin, and all nerves are
confluent at the base of the blade. The thyrsus is
5.5–11.5 cm long; bracteoles are 7–11 × 3–7 mm, caducous
at anthesis, lanceolate, concave, with an acute apex, glabrous on
the adaxial surface, and strigose on the abaxial surface. Flowers
are 5-merous, pedicellate, with pedicels 1–3 mm long; hypanthia are
4–5 × ca. 3 mm, campanulate; sepals are 1–2 ×
3–5 mm, lanceolate, with an acute apex, ciliate margins, and
are caducous in fruit; petals are 1.8–2 × 1.9–2.2 cm,
obovate, with a truncate apex, shortly ciliate margin, purple and
white at the base, turning red with age; there are
10 stamens, dimorphic, with filaments covered in glandular trichomes, anthers
subulate with an apical pore of 0.1 mm diameter, pedoconnective
prolonged ca. 1 mm, appendages 0.2–0.5 mm, bilobed and glabrous;
antesepalous stamens have filaments 6–7 mm long and anthers 5–6
mm long, magenta in color; antepetalous stamens have filaments 4–5
mm long and anthers ca. 4 mm long, white; the
ovary is ca. 4 × 3 mm, two-thirds fused to
the hypanthium, with a free apex, and the apical portion
is densely covered with setose-glandular trichomes; the style is ca.
4 mm long and sparsely setose. The capsule is 4–5
× 4–4.5 mm, globose; seeds are ca. 1 × 0.5
mm, cochleate, with a tuberculate testa.
