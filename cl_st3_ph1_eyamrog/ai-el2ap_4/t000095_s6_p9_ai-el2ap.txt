Although measures such as the Provisional Contribution on Financial Transactions
(EC29/2000) and the Health +10 Movement were implemented to enhance
health financing, the proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) allocated
to the Unified Health System (SUS) remained lower than private
health expenditure. In 2017, Brazil's total health expenditure was 9.2%
of GDP, of which public spending accounted for 3.9% (42%)
and private spending accounted for 5.4% (58%).
