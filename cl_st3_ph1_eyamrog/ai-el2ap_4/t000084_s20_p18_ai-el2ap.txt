The prevalence of emojis coded as indicators of social presence
may reflect characteristics commonly associated with Brazilian culture, which is
often described as joyful, affectionate, and friendly. A substantial number
of Red Heart (‚ù§), Face Throwing a Kiss, and Smiling
Face With Smiling Eyes and Three Hearts emojis, as illustrated
in Figure 4, were observed predominantly in interactions classified as
social presence. However, these emojis were also present, albeit less
frequently, in interactions coded as cognitive and teaching presences.
