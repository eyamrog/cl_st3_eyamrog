The behavior associated with each Ha's mobility is assumed to
vary depending on the time of day; therefore, specific Hidden
Markov Models (HMMs) are generated for different time intervals. Similarly,
variations are observed across different age groups. Each Ha exhibits
characteristic mobility patterns and activities according to its age range,
which are shared by all human agents within the same
neighborhood or district.
