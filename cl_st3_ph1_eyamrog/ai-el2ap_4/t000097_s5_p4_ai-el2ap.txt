Two study protocols included in this scoping review involved dance-based
interventions. Additional studies, such as those by Loo et al.
and Ho et al., demonstrated that participation in dance activities
led to increased physical activity among breast cancer survivors. These
interventions were also associated with improvements in quality of life,
including increased vigor, reductions in obesity-related issues, and decreased levels
of stress and pain. Regarding Pilates interventions, the study by
Eyigor et al. indicated that Pilates is a safe and
effective exercise modality for breast cancer patients, contributing to enhancements
in functional capacity, reductions in fatigue and depression, and improvements
in quality of life. Similarly, Alpozgen et al. reported that
Pilates was effective in reducing pain, increasing muscle strength, and
serving as a beneficial rehabilitation exercise for women with breast
cancer. Therefore, Pilates may be considered a viable alternative intervention
for this population.
