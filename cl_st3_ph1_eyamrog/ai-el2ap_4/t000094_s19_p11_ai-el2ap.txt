Analysis of the theme-rheme structure indicates that themes are unmarked
in the majority of cases (75%), as they typically correspond
to the subject in declarative clauses, such as ‘my name’,
the demonstrative ‘this’, ‘I’, ‘we’, and ‘they’. In the four
imperative clauses, the theme is realized by the predicator or
by the construction let + subject, as in ‘be careful’,
‘come’, ‘find out’, and ‘let’s not forget’. As shown in
Table 1, simple themes occur more frequently than multiple themes.
