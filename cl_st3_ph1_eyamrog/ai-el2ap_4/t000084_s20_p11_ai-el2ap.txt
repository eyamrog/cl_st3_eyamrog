The data analyses and cloud maps indicate that various types
of emojis were identified as markers of teaching presence. The
Winking Face emoji was frequently employed to mitigate the perceived
impact of interventions, such as confirming and clarifying tasks, encouraging
participant contributions, and maintaining the focus of discussions on the
assigned task. For example, in Group 1, this emoji was
used to promote participant engagement. Additionally, the Smiling Face emoji
was observed to function as an acknowledgment of participants' contributions.
