For 20 of these countries, we obtained the number of
deaths within nine standardized age groups (0–9, 10–19, 20–29, 30–39,
40–49, 50–59, 60–69, 70–79, and 80 years or older) either
directly, by aggregating more detailed age categories, or through minor
adjustments. For 11 of these countries—Germany, Canada, Spain, France, England
(including Wales), Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland (including Liechtenstein),
and Ukraine—the data were sourced exclusively from the website of
the French National Institute of Demographic Studies.
