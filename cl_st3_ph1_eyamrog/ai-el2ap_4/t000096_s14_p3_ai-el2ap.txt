The development of the documentary research was guided by the
PICOC method (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, Context) as outlined by
Petticrew and Roberts (2006). This approach begins with the formulation
of a research question to direct the investigation toward relevant
information for curriculum development. Subsequently, the research question is divided
into four sub-questions corresponding to the elements of the PICOC
framework, as detailed in Table 1. The "Comparison" component was
excluded from this process, as it was not applicable to
the present study.
