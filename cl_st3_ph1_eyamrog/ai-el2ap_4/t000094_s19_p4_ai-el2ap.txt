On page 16, Emily is depicted in the park, with
Dad actively pushing her on the swings; she is prominently
positioned on the right side of the illustration. The subsequent
page references this activity, and, in addition to the centrally
placed written text on the right, which appears on the
grass, Daddy and Max are shown merely observing Dad and
Emily on the swing. This scene clearly illustrates Dad as
the active participant, while Daddy assumes a passive, observational role.
