To calculate the average for each Dimension, the mean value
is first determined for each Dimension within the “U-Multirank” dataset.
The distribution of these averages is then analyzed. Figure 4
provides an initial overview of this distribution. The horizontal axis
represents the average of all Dimensions for each institution, while
the vertical axis displays the average scores for Teaching and
Learning (blue diamonds), Research (red squares), Knowledge Transfer (green triangles),
International Orientation (purple circles), and Regional Engagement (blue X). The
analysis includes data from 1,070 European academic institutions listed in
the 2020 edition of “U-Multirank.”
