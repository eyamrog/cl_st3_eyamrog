Anxiety can adversely affect dental treatment outcomes and may contribute
to the deterioration of oral health (Pinheiro et al., 2014;
da Cunha et al., 2021). Patients experiencing anxiety, fear, or
dental phobia are more likely to delay or avoid seeking
necessary oral health care (Deogade & Suresan, 2016; Ara√∫jo et
al., 2018). Furthermore, anxiety-related symptoms can interfere with dental procedures,
potentially compromising patient safety and the quality of care provided
(Facco & Zanette, 2017), and may also negatively impact overall
quality of life (da Cunha et al., 2021).
