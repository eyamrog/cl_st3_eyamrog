To facilitate children's active engagement with the interpretive possibilities of
images, it is necessary for them to develop an understanding
of the meaning-making systems utilized in visual representations. This process
requires the establishment of a shared metalanguage, which serves as
a framework for describing visual meaning-making resources in a manner
comparable to the grammatical analysis of meaning-making systems in verbal
texts.
