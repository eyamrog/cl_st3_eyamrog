A comparison of Tables 4 and 5 indicates that participantsâ€™
responses were influenced by the verb combinations in the biased
sentences, with this effect being particularly pronounced among native speakers.
When the semantic preference aligned with the PAS, the proportion
of corresponding responses increased, except among intermediate learners, whose preference
for zero anaphora decreased, although the subject of the main
clause remained the most frequent choice. In cases where the
semantic preference was contrary to the PAS, native speakers were
more strongly influenced by semantic factors. While learners were also
affected by semantics, their preferential choice shifted only in the
case of pronominal cataphora, with the exception of Portuguese intermediate
learners, who did not exhibit a clear preference; however, this
subgroup consisted of only four participants. Consistent with the findings
for Portuguese biased sentences, Portuguese speakers continued to be influenced
by the PAS when ellipsis occurred in subject position. Consequently,
their tendency to resolve ellipsis in the subject position of
subordinate clauses as referring to the subject of the main
clause decreased in cases of zero cataphora, although this remained
their predominant choice.
