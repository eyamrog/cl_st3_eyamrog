The actions selected indicate that Emily leads a balanced life,
engaging in activities with both of her fathers. Several of
these activities are associated with enjoyment, such as playing both
indoors and outdoors. Other actions are clearly related to domestic
tasks, including cooking and sewing. Notably, there is no depiction
of Emily studying or completing homework. The activity most closely
resembling academic work is painting or reading with her two
fathers in bed at the conclusion of the story.
