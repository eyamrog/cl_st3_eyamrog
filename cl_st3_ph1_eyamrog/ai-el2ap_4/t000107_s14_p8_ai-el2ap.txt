To build upon the methodology proposed by Alves and Vasconcellos
(2016), we conducted a search using the authors’ names—previously identified
on DomínioPúblico, BDTD, and the CAPES Theses and Dissertations Catalog—to
determine which of these platforms hosted the theses and dissertations
included in our study. This procedure was implemented to introduce
an additional filter, thereby minimizing the likelihood of including studies
that did not satisfy the mapping inclusion criteria. Subsequently, to
analyze the topics addressed in these theses and dissertations, we
downloaded the respective files and reviewed their abstracts. The results
of this analysis are presented in Section 4.
