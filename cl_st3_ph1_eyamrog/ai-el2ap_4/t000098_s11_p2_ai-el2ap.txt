When comparisons between locations are a central component of analysis,
as in this article, differences in population size necessitate the
use of population-adjusted indicators. Deaths per capita—typically expressed per 100,000
or 1 million inhabitants—are commonly employed for this purpose. However,
these indicators may introduce significant biases if the populations being
compared are exposed to varying risks of developing severe forms
of Covid-19 due to pre-existing conditions. Among these, the prevalence
of comorbidities and the demographic composition of the population, particularly
with respect to sex and age, are the most influential
factors.
