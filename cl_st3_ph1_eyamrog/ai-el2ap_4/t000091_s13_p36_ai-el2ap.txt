The pharmacological properties of kava include voltage-dependent sodium channel blockade,
enhancement of GABA binding, and reduced release of excitatory neurotransmitters
resulting from calcium ion channel inhibition. Additional effects of kava
are neuronal depression, inhibition of noradrenaline (norepinephrine) uptake, reversible inhibition
of monoamine oxidase, and suppression of eicosanoid thromboxane synthesis activity,
which antagonizes GABA receptor function (Jamieson & Duffield, 1990; Singh
& Singh, 2002; Tzeng et al., 2015).
