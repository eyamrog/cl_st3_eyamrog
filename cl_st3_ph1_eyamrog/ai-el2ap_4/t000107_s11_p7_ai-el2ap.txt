James Stratton Holmes introduced the term "translation studies" and, through
his mapping of the discipline (1972–1988), contributed to both the
organization and the expansion of its scope. Following Holmes’s framework,
translation studies began to achieve greater autonomy from related fields
such as linguistics, literary studies, cultural studies, and technical translation.
This increased autonomy established translation studies as a distinct field
suitable for theoretical, descriptive, and applied research. Nevertheless, the evolving
nature of translation, including the adoption of corpus-based and corpus-driven
methodologies, has highlighted the need to revise and expand Holmes’s
original map. In Brazil, for instance, such expansions have been
proposed by Pagano and Vasconcellos (2003) and by Alves and
Vasconcellos (2016).
