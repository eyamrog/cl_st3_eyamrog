Figure 2 presents the average values of the Dimensions (vertical
axis) as a function of the position of each Academic
Institution according to the “U-Multirank” ranking (horizontal axis). The analysis
includes all 1,070 European Academic Institutions listed in the 2020
edition. While there is a general trend indicating higher average
scores among institutions with better rankings, the correlation is not
strong, as illustrated in Figure 2. Notably, many institutions with
average grades above 2.5 are found among the lowest 300
positions in the overall ranking. These results suggest that the
criteria and methodology employed by “U-Multirank” should be interpreted with
caution and may warrant further review.
