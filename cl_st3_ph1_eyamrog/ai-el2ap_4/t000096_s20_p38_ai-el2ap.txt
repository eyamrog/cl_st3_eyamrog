Over the years, education has been a subject of ongoing
debate due to its various psycho-pedagogical, social, and cultural implications.
This debate has intensified in recent times as student populations
have become increasingly diverse, leading to a demand for alternative
educational systems. These systems require teachers who possess a strong
command of didactic content knowledge in order to enhance the
teacher-student relationship and address the evolving needs of learners (Imbern√≥n,
2014).
