Previous studies have indicated that V. officinalis exhibits low toxicity
(Bos et al., 1998; Yao et al., 2007). A review
of the literature demonstrates that valerian is generally regarded as
a safe herbal remedy, with diurnal sleepiness being the only
adverse effect reported, and this effect occurs primarily at higher
doses. Furthermore, no significant harmful side effects have been documented
(Kinrys et al., 2009; Baek et al., 2014). Consistent with
these findings, Pinheiro et al. (2014) reported no adverse effects
such as dizziness, gastrointestinal disturbances, allergic reactions, or paradoxical responses
in their study.
