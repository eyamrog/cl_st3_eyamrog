Studies have documented the environmental impacts associated with tourism in
rivers located within protected areas, such as the Formoso River
in the Formoso River Ecological Park in Bonito and the
Prata River in the Private Reserve of Natural Heritage (RPPN)
Fazenda Cabeceira do Prata (Escarpinati et al., 2011; Coelho et
al., 2011). Both rivers are situated in the state of
Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), in the central-west region of
Brazil, and are recognized as significant tourist destinations.
