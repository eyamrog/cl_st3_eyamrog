Analysis of the spreadsheet containing the collected data identified several
inconsistencies. Specifically, the titles of two theses obtained from the
Catálogo de Teses e Dissertações da CAPES differed from those
listed on the BDTD website. The titles from the BDTD
were considered accurate, as they corresponded to the titles presented
in the official thesis documents. Additionally, cross-referencing the spreadsheet entries
by author names and publication years revealed that one thesis
title appeared in English on the BDTD website but in
Portuguese in the Catálogo de Teses e Dissertações da CAPES.
Figure 8 presents the results obtained after these inconsistencies were
addressed.
