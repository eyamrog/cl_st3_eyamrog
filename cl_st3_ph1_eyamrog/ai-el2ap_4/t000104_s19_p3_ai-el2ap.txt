The CaCO3 concentrations in the sediment samples were low, ranging
from 0.099 to 0.845 (Table 2), indicating a limited presence
of bioclastic structures such as shells. These low concentrations can
be attributed to the high energy of the river flow,
which facilitates the rapid removal of CaCO3 fragments due to
their lower density and susceptibility to downstream transport. Similarly, the
organic matter (OM) content was also low (4.51, 6.28, and
4.74, respectively), which is consistent with the high water flow
conditions that inhibit the deposition of organic material (Teixeira et
al., 2000).
