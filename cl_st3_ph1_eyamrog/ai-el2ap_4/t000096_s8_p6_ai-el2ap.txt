In Ecuador, there is a limited availability of postgraduate programs
in education, particularly at the master's level, that focus on
the integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) as tools
to facilitate and mediate learning processes. Consequently, many education professionals
seeking specialization in this area are required to pursue studies
at foreign universities, where they encounter not only financial barriers
but also the challenge that the curricula of these programs
are not tailored to the specific needs and context of
Ecuador.
