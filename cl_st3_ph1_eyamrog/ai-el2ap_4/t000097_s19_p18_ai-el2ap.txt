Physical and psychological outcomes were assessed in all studies. Each
study protocol included evaluations of female participants at baseline and
post-intervention. Several studies also conducted assessments during the intervention period,
specifically at the 6th week, the 8th and 14th weeks,
the 12th week, and the 15th week. In addition, some
studies incorporated follow-up assessments at various time points after the
intervention, including 24 weeks, 24 and 36 weeks, 6 months,
6, 12, and 24 months, 12 and 18 months, 12
and 24 months, and 18 months.
