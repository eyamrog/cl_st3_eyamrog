Sensitive organisms were collected at all sampling sites. The order
Plecoptera is assigned a high value in biological index calculations
due to its pronounced sensitivity to pollution and low dissolved
oxygen levels (Timm, 1997). Studies conducted in Estonia have demonstrated
that Plecoptera are sensitive to various physicochemical water parameters, including
pH and temperature (Timm, 1997; Hrovat et al., 2009). The
order Trichoptera comprises numerous species with a global distribution, which
are typically more abundant in cold, flowing waters such as
waterfalls and springs. The larval stages of Trichoptera are exclusively
aquatic. This group is considered an effective biological indicator, particularly
certain species that exhibit heightened sensitivity to pollutants (Holzenthal et
al., 2015). Trichoptera includes species that construct protective, predatory, or
filter-feeding structures from materials such as sand grains, small rocks,
and leaves, as well as free-living species that do not
build such structures (Holzenthal et al., 2015).
