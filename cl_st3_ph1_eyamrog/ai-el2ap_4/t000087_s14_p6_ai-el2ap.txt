RNA was extracted using the TRIzol protocol (TRIzolTM Reagent, no
date; Rio et al., 2010) from a sample obtained from
a fully vaccinated, symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive patient, which exhibited a
Ct value of 22.53 as determined by the RIDAGENE SARS-COV-2
RT-PCR MULTIPLEX kit (R-BIOPHARM AG). This RNA was subsequently used
to prepare an Illumina sequencing library following the Artic v3
protocol (Pipelines R&D et al., 2020). The resulting SARS-CoV-2 amplicon
library was sequenced at the Unidad Universitaria de Secuenciación Masiva
y Bioinformática (UNAM) using the Illumina NextSeq500 platform with a
300-cycle kit in paired-end mode, generating reads of 150 base
pairs in length.
