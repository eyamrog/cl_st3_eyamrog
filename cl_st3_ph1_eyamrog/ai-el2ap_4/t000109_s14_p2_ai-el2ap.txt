As an agent-based model (ABM), the core of the system
consists of agents referred to as humans (Ha). Each Ha
is capable of acquiring and transmitting the SARS-CoV-2 virus, exhibiting
changes in symptoms and health status in response to infection
dynamics, and modifying behaviors accordingly (see Infectivity submodel, Section 3.1).
Additionally, each Ha possesses specific characteristics and attributes that correspond
to particular risk factors and comorbidities (see Epidemiological Characterization submodel,
Section 3.2).
