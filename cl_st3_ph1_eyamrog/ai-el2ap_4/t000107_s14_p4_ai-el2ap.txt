To further assess the reliability of the portal, a search
was conducted on Google.com using the terms dissertação, mestrado, and
tradução médica (thesis, master’s, and medical translation, respectively). This search
yielded approximately 1,910,000 results for master's theses and 1,080,000 for
doctoral dissertations. Some results that met the established selection criteria
but were not identified in the initial search on www.dominiopublico.gov.br
were noted and subsequently re-examined on the Domínio Público website.
The re-examination was limited to results appearing on the first
two pages of the Google search, as a comprehensive review
of all eligible results not found in the initial Domínio
Público search would have been excessively time-consuming. This process revealed
master’s theses and doctoral dissertations completed within the study’s designated
timeframe that were not catalogued on the Domínio Público website.
The identification of these discrepancies prompted an expansion of the
methodology proposed by Alves and Vasconcellos (2016), which had previously
involved entering keywords exclusively on www.dominiopublico.gov.br.
