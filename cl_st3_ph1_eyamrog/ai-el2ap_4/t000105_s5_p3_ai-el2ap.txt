According to the literature, several factors may account for the
observed differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates between regions and among
distinct population groups. These factors include variations in the stage
of the epidemic, limited testing capacity, delayed case detection, differences
in the implementation of control measures such as movement restrictions,
as well as local sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Additionally, environmental
and meteorological factors, including humidity and air pollution, have also
been identified as potential contributors to these disparities [4,29].
