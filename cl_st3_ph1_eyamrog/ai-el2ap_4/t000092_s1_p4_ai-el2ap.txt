The high-frequency (HF) component, which primarily reflects parasympathetic activity, and
the low-frequency (LF) component, which represents both sympathetic and parasympathetic
influences, can be quantified through frequency domain analysis of heart
rate variability. The ratio of LF to HF (LF/HF ratio)
is commonly used as an index of sympathovagal balance. In
this study, 41.2% of the patients exhibited an elevated LF/HF
ratio.
