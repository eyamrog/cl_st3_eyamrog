Table 1 indicates that the four studies were conducted by
researchers from similar academic fields. Two of the studies involved
English-Portuguese translations, while the other two involved German-Portuguese translations. Notably,
both studies conducted at UFRGS focused on German-Portuguese translations, which
may reflect the influence of the German language in southern
Brazil.
