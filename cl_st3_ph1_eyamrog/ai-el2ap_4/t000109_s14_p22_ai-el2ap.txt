This block models the impact of public transportation on COVID-19
epidemiology. Each public transportation line is represented as a fixed
location on the map, with each bus stop depicted as
a 10x4 m plot. This simplification is intended to capture
only the primary features of public transportation dynamics relevant to
the study. Human agents may enter this plot at intervals
of 20 minutes, reflecting the average frequency of local transportation
services, and typically maintain an average distance of 2 meters
from one another for a duration of 20 minutes. Physical
distancing is not maintained for approximately one minute, corresponding to
the time required for agents to move from the entrance
to their seat and from the seat to the exit.
After 20 minutes, each human agent may either relocate to
a new position on the map or remain in the
transportation area for an additional 20 minutes, based on a
transition probability determined by the Mobility/Activity submodel, which will be
described in the following section.
