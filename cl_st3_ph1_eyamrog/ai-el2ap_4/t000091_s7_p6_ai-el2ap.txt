Phytotherapy has been widely utilized and is generally recognized as
an established treatment for depressive disorders, which has prompted research
into its potential efficacy in the treatment of various anxiety
disorders (Kinrys et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2015; Fajemiroye
et al., 2016). Phytotherapy is defined as the treatment of
medical conditions using fresh plants, plant-derived substances, or extracts prepared
from these raw materials (Fajemiroye et al., 2016).
