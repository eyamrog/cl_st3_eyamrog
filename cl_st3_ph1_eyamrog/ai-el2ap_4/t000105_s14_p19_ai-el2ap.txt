At the conclusion of the blood collection process, the interviewer
initiated a face-to-face interview, which lasted between 30 and 45
minutes, depending on the interviewee's ability to comprehend and respond
to the questions. Data were collected using the DataGoalÂ® application
installed on tablets, which also recorded the geographic coordinates (latitude
and longitude) of the interviewee's residence.
