The study protocols reviewed demonstrated various approaches to intervention through
physical activity and/or physical exercise; however, several protocols were limited
by insufficient reporting of key parameters such as intensity, frequency,
or session duration, which are essential for optimizing intervention implementation.
Notably, the earliest study protocol identified in this scoping review
was published in 2013, indicating that earlier clinical trials often
did not publish their protocols and that the practice of
protocol publication is still developing. Additionally, the publication of study
protocols is constrained by the policies of some scientific journals,
and some authors of randomized clinical trials opt not to
publish their protocols.
