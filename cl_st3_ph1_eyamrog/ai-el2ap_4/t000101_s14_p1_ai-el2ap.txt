As part of a larger multi-year research project, current and
former federal employees participated in an online survey and a
semi-structured interview lasting between 1 and 1.5 hours, conducted via
Zoom. The survey received responses from 337 individuals, of whom
129 subsequently participated in interviews. Research participants were not selected
through representative or purposive sampling. Due to the lack of
access to databases containing contact information for federal employees—an access
not facilitated by the Brazilian government except for government research
institutions—it was not possible to design a representative sample. As
a result, the study employed a snowball sampling method, promoting
the survey through social media channels. The survey questionnaire was
piloted in the summer of 2019 with a small group
of federal civil servants at Brazil’s National School of Public
Administration (ENAP), and the initial version was reviewed by public
policy professors and researchers based in Brazil. Following revisions based
on this feedback, the survey was distributed more broadly.
