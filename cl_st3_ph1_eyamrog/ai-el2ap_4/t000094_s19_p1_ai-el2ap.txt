Me, Daddy & Dad begins with an illustration featuring pieces
of paper and pencils prominently placed on the floor, while
none of the characters are visually depicted in this initial
scene. Nevertheless, the characters are referenced both in the accompanying
written text and in images situated in the background. The
written text is primarily displayed on the wall, except for
one line that is positioned on the carpet and is
visually emphasized by its central placement on the page. On
the following page, all the main characters are introduced: Dad
and Daddy are shown in the background, while Emily, the
protagonist, appears in the left foreground, partially obscured by Max,
the family dog, who is seated on a carpet that
serves as a framing device. All three characters are depicted
wearing casual attire, including jeans, t-shirts, and shirts. Dad is
illustrated with dark hair, whereas Daddy and Emily are both
depicted as blonde.
