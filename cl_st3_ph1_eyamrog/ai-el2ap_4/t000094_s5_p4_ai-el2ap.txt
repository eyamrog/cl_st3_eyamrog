Me, Daddy & Dad (2017) depicts the characters engaging in
various activities, including painting, washing the car and playing with
the hose, cooking, playing ‘Time for tea’, visiting the local
swings, playing dress up, fishing, playing chase, and reading. All
of these activities are represented through material processes, indicating observable
actions. The range of activities presented both visually and textually
suggests that Emily and her two fathers are portrayed as
an active family unit. Activities such as drinking with the
child, playing and running with her, and reading to her
in bed emphasize their familial bond and illustrate that their
daily routines are comparable to those of heterosexual families. Accordingly,
this picturebook exemplifies what Sunderland and McLashan (2012, p. 168)
describe as the “backgrounding strategy” in the representation of gay
families, as the narrative does not address issues of gay
sexuality directly or indirectly, but instead focuses on family life
and personal experiences that are not exclusive to gay families.
