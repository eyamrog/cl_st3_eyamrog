This study utilized the top 300 performing universities in Europe,
as identified in the 2020 edition of U-Multirank. The selection
of this sample was based not only on the availability
of more comprehensive data, as previously discussed, but also on
the advantage that these institutions are located within the same
continent. This geographic consistency helps to minimize the influence of
cultural and contextual differences, thereby allowing the analysis to focus
primarily on the indicators and dimensions employed by the ranking
system.
