Among the proponents of the neutralist-liberal conception in Ireland are
organizations such as the Humanist Association of Ireland (HAI), Education
Equality, and Atheist Ireland. While these groups share the position
that the Irish educational system requires reform to prevent discrimination
in admissions and to uphold the rights of conscience for
both children and parents, their specific proposals concerning the current
study of religion in schools differ in certain respects.
