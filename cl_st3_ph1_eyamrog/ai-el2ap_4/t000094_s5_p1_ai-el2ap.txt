This picturebook exemplifies a work in which the visual elements
directly illustrate the content of the written text. The narrative
can be comprehended solely through the visuals, as they effectively
depict the primary actions described by the text. As a
result, children are unlikely to encounter difficulties in understanding the
story or in recognizing how the visual and verbal modes
interact to reinforce the central meanings conveyed by the characters’
actions. Furthermore, the absence of a fixed placement for the
written text—appearing either before or after the visuals—indicates that its
position does not significantly influence children’s comprehension of the picturebook’s
plot.
