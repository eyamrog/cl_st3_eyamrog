Finally, the dog, Max, functions as the written theme in
three instances (4.68%) where he is referred to as ‘Max’
and, on two occasions, as ‘he’. This aligns with his
visual thematization, as he is prominently positioned in the right-hand
corner of page 24. The thematic focus on the dog
serves to assign him significance within the narrative. Additionally, Max
is visually foregrounded by being depicted in front of Emily
during the initial scene in which all characters appear together.
