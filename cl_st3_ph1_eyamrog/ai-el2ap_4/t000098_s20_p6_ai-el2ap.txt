Figure 1 presents the age distribution profiles of populations by
selecting three representative countries from the groups previously identified: England
and Wales, Brazil, and the Philippines. The population of England
and Wales exhibits a higher proportion of individuals in older
age groups and a relatively even distribution among age cohorts
up to 50 years. In contrast, the age distribution in
the Philippines is characterized by a steady decline in population
share with increasing age. Brazil, which began its demographic transition
several decades ago, displays an intermediate pattern between these two
cases. It is important to note that, due to the
large population sizes of countries with age structures similar to
that of the Philippines, the global age composition more closely
resembles this pattern, although the effect is somewhat moderated.
