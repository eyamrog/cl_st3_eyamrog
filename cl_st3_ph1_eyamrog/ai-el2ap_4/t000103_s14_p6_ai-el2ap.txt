The sentence "Matthew harassed George when HE interviewed him" is
structurally ambiguous, as the pronoun "he" could refer to either
Matthew or George. Consequently, it is unclear whether Matthew harassed
George during an interview conducted by Matthew or by George.
This ambiguity arises from the pronoun's unclear antecedent, which affects
the interpretation of the subject performing the interview.
