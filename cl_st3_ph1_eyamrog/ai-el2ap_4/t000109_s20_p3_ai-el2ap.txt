Figure 6 presents the estimated daily number of COVID-19 cases
(including both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals) generated by the model
for the period under analysis. Official case numbers represent only
a subset of the true total, as they are influenced
by testing policies, case monitoring practices, and the inherent challenges
in identifying asymptomatic infections. The model indicates that the actual
number of infected individuals exceeds the figures reported in official
statistics. This finding is consistent with results reported in previous
studies [49].
