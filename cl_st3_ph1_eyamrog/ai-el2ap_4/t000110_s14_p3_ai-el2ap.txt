For diatom analyses, organic matter was removed by oxidation using
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 35%) and hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%) following
standard procedures (Battarbee et al. 2001). Permanent slides were prepared
with Naphrax (refractive index 1.6) as the mounting medium. Optical
observations, measurements, and photomicrographs were conducted at 1,000× magnification using
a Zeiss Axioskop 2 plus microscope equipped with an Axiocam
ERc5s high-resolution digital camera. A minimum of 400 valves per
slide were counted in accordance with Battarbee et al. (2001).
Species abundance was determined by dividing the count of each
species by the total valve count and expressing the result
as a percentage for each slide (subsample). Taxonomic identification and
nomenclature were based on relevant literature (e.g., Lange-Bertalot 1993; Metzeltin
& Lange-Bertalot 1998; Morales & Manoylov 2006; Garcia 2010; Lange-Bertalot
et al. 2011; Reichardt 2015; Almeida et al. 2015; Tyree
& Vaccarino 2016; Costa et al. 2017b; Bartozek et al.
2018) and the online catalog of valid names (Fourtanier &
Kociolek 2011). Classification followed Medlin & Kaczmarska (2004) for supra-ordinal
taxa and Round et al. (1990) for subordinal taxa, except
for genera described after these publications. New records for Brazil
and the Brazilian Amazon (including the states of Amazonas, Amapá,
Mato Grosso, western Maranhão, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima, Acre, and Tocantins)
were identified based on a review of the published literature.
Morphometric data are provided for new records, including valve mantle
(M), diameter (D), length (L), width (W), length/width ratio (L/W),
striae (S), areolae (A), and fibulae (F). Sediment samples are
deposited in the “Herbário Científico do Estado Maria Eneyda P.
Kauffmann Fidalgo” (SP), São Paulo, Brazil, under accession numbers SP470331
to SP513834.
