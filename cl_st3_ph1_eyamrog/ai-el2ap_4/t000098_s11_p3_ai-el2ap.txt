The association between various chronic diseases and an increased risk
of severe forms of COVID-19 is well documented in the
medical literature [Zhou et al., 2020; Chow et al., 2020,
as cited in Borges & Crespo, 2020]. Cardiovascular diseases, diabetes,
respiratory diseases, obesity, and immunodeficiency are among the most frequently
identified risk factors. Additionally, evidence indicates that the risk of
mortality from COVID-19 is significantly higher among males. A meta-analysis
incorporating data from 46 countries and 44 US states found
that this risk is 39% higher in men [Peckham et
al., 2020: 2], which is consistent with findings from studies
conducted during the early months of the pandemic [Goujon et
al., 2020: 5; Guilmoto, 2020: 8]. While the relative contribution
of each factor remains subject to debate, the main determinants
of this disparity are well established in the literature. Peckham
et al. (2020) acknowledge the potential influence of sociocultural factors
and differences in comorbidity prevalence, but, based on a comprehensive
review of biological differences between the sexes—particularly in immune system
responses to infection—they emphasize the predominance of biological factors.
