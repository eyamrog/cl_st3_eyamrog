It was also observed that the interventions primarily involved moderate-intensity
exercise, consistent with the recommendations of Spence et al., who
advised at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week
for breast cancer patients, as implemented in the randomized clinical
trials by Ligibel et al., Arem et al., and Mijwel
et al. A limitation identified in some study protocols was
the insufficient reporting of exercise intensity. Clear specification of exercise
intensity by researchers is necessary to demonstrate the efficacy of
interventions and to facilitate the replication and implementation of future
intervention protocols.
