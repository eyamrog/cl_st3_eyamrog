A total of 806 articles were identified. After removing duplicates
and excluding studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria,
17 articles were included in the review. The methodological quality
of these studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool,
and all were classified as having a low risk of
bias, indicating methodological rigor. The interventions examined included aerobic exercise,
endurance training, dance, Pilates, and exercises guided by applications and
internet-based software. Most interventions involved moderate-intensity exercise performed three times
per week for 30 minutes per session. The majority of
participants were women in stages 0 to III of the
disease. The study protocols reported improvements in physical outcomes (including
physical fitness, physical activity level, cognitive function, and body composition)
as well as psychological outcomes (including quality of life, fatigue,
depression, and anxiety), supporting the use of physical activity interventions
in this population.
