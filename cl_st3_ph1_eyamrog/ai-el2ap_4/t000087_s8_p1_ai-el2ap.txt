Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent
of COVID-19, had infected over 200 million individuals and resulted
in more than 4 million deaths globally by August 2021
(Harvey et al., 2021). Since the onset of the pandemic,
multiple candidate vaccines have been developed, several of which demonstrated
high efficacy and were subsequently authorized for emergency use within
one year of the initial report of coronavirus disease 2019
(Polack et al., 2020). According to the World Health Organization,
vaccination is considered the second most effective public health intervention
for the mitigation and control of infectious diseases, following access
to clean water (World Health Organization, no date). In December
2020, many countries initiated large-scale vaccination programs, prioritizing the protection
of the most vulnerable populations, including the elderly, individuals at
increased risk of exposure due to high-risk occupations, healthcare workers,
and frontline personnel (Russell and Greenwood, 2021).
