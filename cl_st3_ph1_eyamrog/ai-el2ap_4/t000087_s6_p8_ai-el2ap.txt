Spreading events have increased in frequency as vaccinated individuals participate
in social gatherings following the near-total relaxation of safety measures.
Notably, two positive cases in this study were adolescents who
attended the event despite being symptomatic. Such behavior increases the
risk of exposing others to infection with a variant of
concern (VOC), particularly in settings with high community transmission. The
findings of this study demonstrate the limitations of relying on
a single mitigation strategy and underscore the need to communicate
the importance of implementing multiple, layered protective measures to reduce
the risk of transmission and infection during the COVID-19 pandemic.
