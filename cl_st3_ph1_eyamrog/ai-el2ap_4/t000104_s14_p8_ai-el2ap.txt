The sampling method followed the protocol proposed by Buss (2008),
with adaptations from CETESB (2019), which recommend that sampling should
account for the presence of different mesohabitats, including fine substrates
(such as fine sands and muds), coarser materials (such as
coarse sands), as well as gravel, pebbles, and loose rocks.
At the Cachoeira do Paraíso waterfall, the environment was classified
as a thick substrate mesohabitat, which is generally associated with
lower biodiversity compared to other mesohabitat types (Buss, 2008). Each
sampling site was sampled in three distinct sections within the
same mesohabitat using a sieve with a 0.5–0.6 mm mesh,
following the kick sampling technique, in which samples are collected
directly from the substrate (Buss, 2008; Feeley et al., 2011;
CETESB, 2019). The collected organisms were sorted under a stereomicroscope,
separated from the sediment, and preserved in 40% alcohol. Subsequently,
the specimens were examined and taxonomically classified as described in
the following sections.
