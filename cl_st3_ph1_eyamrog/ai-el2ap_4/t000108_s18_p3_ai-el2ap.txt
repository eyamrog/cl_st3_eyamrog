Diagnosis: Pleroma eglanduliferum can be distinguished by its larger bracteoles,
which measure 7–11 × 3–7 mm and exceed the size
of the hypanthia (4–5 × approximately 3 mm). The hypanthia
are covered with strigose, eglandular trichomes. Additionally, the species exhibits
dimorphic stamens with glabrous connectives throughout, including the appendages.
