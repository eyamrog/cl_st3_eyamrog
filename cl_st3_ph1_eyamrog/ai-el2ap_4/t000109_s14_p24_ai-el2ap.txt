This submodel simulates the mobility patterns of human agents residing
within a district or neighborhood, taking into account both the
agents' age ranges and the specific time slots under consideration.
It also determines the type of activity each human agent
will engage in at their designated location during the subsequent
time period. Certain activities, such as the type and location
of work or study, are assigned uniquely to each agent
for the duration of the simulation, while others, such as
leisure activities, are determined dynamically at the time they are
to be performed.
