Ambiguity is a well-documented issue in anaphora resolution, and extensive
research has addressed this topic (Alonso-Ovalle et al., 2002; Keating
et al., 2011; Lobo & Silva, 2016; Sorace & Filiaci,
2006; Valenzuela et al., 2011). These studies have examined how
both L1 and L2 speakers resolve ambiguity across various languages;
however, there remains limited consensus regarding which theoretical framework most
accurately accounts for this phenomenon.
