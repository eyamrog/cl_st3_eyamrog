Considering the aforementioned characteristics of human agents, this submodel functions
as follows: a susceptible human agent (Ha) becomes infected with
probability 𝛽 through interpersonal contact with another infected Ha, who
may be either symptomatic (I) or asymptomatic (A). The probability
of infection is further modulated by a variable v, which
depends on the daily mean temperature. If the susceptible individual
(S) becomes infected, Ha transitions to the exposed compartment (E).
After an average of 1/𝛼 days, exposed individuals become either
asymptomatic or symptomatic with probability 𝜂, which is determined by
the age range of Ha. Once infected, there are two
possible outcomes. The first is that Ha requires hospitalization in
an intensive care unit (ICU) with probability 𝛾, which is
influenced by Ha’s age range, comorbidities, and risk factors. These
risk factors and comorbidities are specific attributes of each Ha,
and their impact on the probability of ICU admission is
detailed in Table 2 in the following section (Epidemiological Characterization
Submodel). If Ha is not transferred to the ICU after
1/𝜇 days, the individual is considered recovered and is assumed
not to be re-infected for an average period of 11
months, as reported in [32]. During the ICU stay, individuals
have a probability 𝜔 of death [33] after an average
duration of 1/𝛹 days [34][35]. After this period, Ha vacates
the ICU bed and transitions to the recovered compartment.
