The Brazilian System of Protected Areas (SNUC) includes among its
objectives the development of mechanisms and incentives for scientific research
and environmental monitoring (BRASIL, 2000). Biomonitoring is one of the
tools available to achieve these objectives and involves the assessment
of bioindicator organisms or communities, specifically by identifying the presence
of organisms with well-documented tolerance ranges to pollutants (PHILLIPS; RAINBOW,
2013). A widely used approach in biomonitoring is the analysis
of benthic macrofauna, which entails the taxonomic identification of macroinvertebrates
to evaluate water quality based on their responses to environmental
variations (PIEDRAS et al., 2006). Macroinvertebrates are ecologically significant organisms
that play key roles in food webs. Due to their
association with substrates, submerged vegetation, and the water column, as
well as their sensitivity to environmental changes, macroinvertebrates are frequently
employed in water quality monitoring worldwide (FRANÃ‡A; CALLISTO, 2012). Various
protocols are available for the biomonitoring of watersheds using microbenthic
communities (MORSE et al., 2007; BUSS, 2008).
