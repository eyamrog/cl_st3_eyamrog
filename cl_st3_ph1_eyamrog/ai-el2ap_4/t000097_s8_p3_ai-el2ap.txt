A search of the databases (PubMed CentralÂ®, Cochrane Library, Web
of Science Core Collection, Scopus, and ScienceDirect) indicated that international
literature has addressed the relationship between physical activity and chronic
diseases since 1983, beginning with the study by Metzner et
al., which suggested that engaging in physical activity may reduce
the risk of chronic diseases. In terms of study protocols,
one of the earliest identified was conducted by Sakheim in
1955, which focused on validating a research protocol in a
psychiatric hospital setting. It was not until 1989, with the
study by Dickhuth et al., that research protocols began to
incorporate physical activity as a variable of interest.
