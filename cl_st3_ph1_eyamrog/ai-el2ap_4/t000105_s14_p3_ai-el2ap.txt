Mariana and Ouro Preto are neighboring, medium-sized cities situated in
the Serra do Espinha√ßo, a central-southern region of the Brazilian
state of Minas Gerais (Figure 1), within the Iron Quadrangle,
which is recognized as the largest iron ore producing area
in Brazil. Due to their distinct historical, sociodemographic, and geographical
characteristics compared to other Brazilian municipalities, and given that surveys
from other regions may not accurately represent the prevalence of
infection among their populations, it is necessary to investigate the
local dynamics of the epidemic in these cities.
