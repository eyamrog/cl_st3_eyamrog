The types of physical activity and exercise included in the
study protocols reviewed in this scoping analysis comprised aerobic exercises,
endurance training, dance, Pilates, and exercises guided by applications and
internet-based software. This indicates that a diverse range of modalities
has been investigated in the context of breast cancer. Consequently,
these study protocols offer multiple intervention options and provide a
structural framework for future randomized clinical trials. Previous studies have
examined some of these modalities, particularly aerobic and endurance exercises,
and have demonstrated their feasibility and safety for women undergoing
breast cancer treatment. The findings from randomized clinical trials conducted
by Paulo et al., García-Soidán et al., and Sweeney et
al. reported significant improvements in strength, flexibility, musculoskeletal function, body
composition, and reductions in treatment-related side effects, as well as
enhancements in quality of life and emotional well-being following interventions
involving aerobic and endurance exercises.
