Emoji use related to cognitive presence was significantly and positively
correlated with participants’ attitudes toward their willingness to apply mobile
technologies (i.e., smartphones, tablets, and apps) to support learners with
diverse backgrounds, characteristics, and abilities (rs = .31, p =
.02). This indicates that participants who reported greater willingness to
use mobile technologies also reported more frequent use of emojis
to exchange and apply ideas during the course. Emoji use
related to social presence was also positively correlated with willingness
to apply mobile technologies, but this correlation did not reach
statistical significance (rs = .24, p = .06). Emoji use
related to teaching presence was not correlated with willingness to
apply mobile technologies (rs = -.01, p = .94). Consistent
with findings by Whiteside (2015), when instructors foster social presence
in their courses, students tend to take a more active
role in constructing their own and their peers’ knowledge, regardless
of prior experience. In the present study, participants reported feeling
connected and contributing to each other’s learning, regardless of their
willingness to apply mobile technologies to empower others. See Table
