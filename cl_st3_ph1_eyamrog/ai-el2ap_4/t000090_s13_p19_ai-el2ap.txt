Next, we conduct a detailed analysis of the extent of
missing and available data in the “U-Multirank” dataset, as well
as the provenance of these data, specifically whether they originate
from open sources or are provided directly by the institutions.
The objective is to gain a clearer understanding of each
indicator by identifying those that serve as weaker or stronger
measures within the ranking, based on their source and availability.
For this analysis, we utilize the data available for the
top 300 performers among European countries in the 2020 edition
of the ranking.
