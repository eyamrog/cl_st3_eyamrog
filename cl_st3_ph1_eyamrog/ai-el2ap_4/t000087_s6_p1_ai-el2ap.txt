This study demonstrates that, during the described superspreading event, the
incidence of COVID-19 was significantly higher in the unvaccinated adolescent
cohort compared to the vaccinated cohort. Specifically, the incidence in
the unvaccinated group was 35.1% (95% CI: 26.1–46.5), whereas in
the vaccinated group it was 11.4% (95% CI: 5.1–21.3), with
a crude odds ratio of 4.19 (95% CI: 1.79–9.8). Among
those who tested positive for COVID-19, 40 out of 41
adolescents exhibited more than one symptom, and only one fully
vaccinated individual remained asymptomatic. The data indicate that vaccination reduced
the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, among those who became
infected, the clinical presentation was similar in both vaccinated and
unvaccinated individuals, with common symptoms including fatigue, runny nose, anosmia,
general discomfort, ageusia, fever, and cough. Fatigue was more frequently
reported among unvaccinated adolescents, while runny nose was more common
among vaccinated adolescents.
