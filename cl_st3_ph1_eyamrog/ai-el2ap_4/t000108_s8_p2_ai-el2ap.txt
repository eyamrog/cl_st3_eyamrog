This mountain chain comprises a mosaic of grassland and forest
environments characterized by high biological diversity and a significant presence
of endemic species, a pattern commonly observed in tropical montane
regions (Martinelli 2007, Salimena et al. 2013). The Serra Negra
region, located in southern Minas Gerais and encompassing the municipalities
of Lima Duarte, Rio Preto, Santa Bárbara do Monte Verde,
and Olaria, contains vegetation dominated by forests and grasslands, particularly
cloud forests and “campos rupestres” (rocky grasslands), which occur at
elevations ranging from 1,300 to 1,700 meters (Salimena et al.
2013). Furthermore, this region forms part of the southeastern corridor
of the Mantiqueira Complex, which consists of remnants of primary
vegetation exhibiting a high degree of connectivity (Salimena et al.
2013).
