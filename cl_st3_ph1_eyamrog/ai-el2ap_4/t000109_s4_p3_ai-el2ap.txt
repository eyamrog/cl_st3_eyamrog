AbCSim provides data that can be used to quantify the
effects of implementing various health policies at the local level.
These capabilities make the model a valuable tool for decision-making
aimed at assessing healthcare system utilization and preventing system overload,
while accounting for individuals' local economic and social contexts. Future
work will include multiple case studies, presenting results from the
application of this model to other cities and at the
state level. Additionally, forthcoming research will address the extension of
the model to incorporate the effects of vaccination campaigns and
different virus variants.
