advantages, and limitations of each methodology, as well as assessing
their effectiveness in facilitating student learning. The research also considers
contextual factors that influence the selection and adaptation of didactic
approaches, including subject matter, student demographics, and available resources. By
systematically comparing these methodologies, the study aims to provide evidence-based
