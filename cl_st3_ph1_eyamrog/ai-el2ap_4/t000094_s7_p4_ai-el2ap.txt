The presence of a two-father family in children's literature can
facilitate the development of gender schemas by exposing children to
diverse gender representations and family structures, such as those depicted
in the story (Campagnaro, 2015; Coats, 2018; Soler Quiles, 2015).
Furthermore, these books may play a role in sex-role socialization,
as demonstrated by the study conducted by Weitzman et al.
(1972, p. 1126).
