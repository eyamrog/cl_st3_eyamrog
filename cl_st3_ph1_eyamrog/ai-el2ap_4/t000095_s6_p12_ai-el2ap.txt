The Covid-19 pandemic exposed significant challenges within Brazilian public institutions,
which were already constrained by fiscal austerity measures and stringent
budgetary restrictions. Between 2018 and 2020, the Unified Health System
(SUS) experienced a reduction of approximately 22.5 billion reais in
funding. Additionally, the allocation and management of specific federal financial
resources to states and municipalities, particularly in Rio de Janeiro,
were inadequate, as previously documented.
