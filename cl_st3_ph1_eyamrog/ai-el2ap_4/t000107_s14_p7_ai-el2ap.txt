The Catálogo de Teses e Dissertações da CAPES (CAPES Catalog)
website indexes theses and dissertations completed at higher education institutions
in Brazil, in accordance with administrative regulation number 13/2006. The
homepage features a single search field for entering keywords and
a search button, with no visible filters initially available. However,
after an initial search is performed, the results page provides
several advanced search filters. These filters enable users to refine
results by type, year, author, supervisor, evaluation committee, major knowledge
area, knowledge area, evaluation area, area of expertise, graduate program,
institution, and library. The present study began with a search
using the keyword tradução (translation). As this search retrieved numerous
theses and dissertations irrelevant to the study’s focus, the available
filters were applied to narrow the results. Additional searches were
conducted using the keywords tradução médica (medical translation) and tradução
de artigos científicos (translation of scientific articles), with the application
of various filters depending on their availability, as the system’s
filter options varied according to the keywords entered.
