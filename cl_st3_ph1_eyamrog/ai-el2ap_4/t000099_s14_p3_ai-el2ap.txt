The following growth parameters were evaluated in 20 randomly selected
plants from a total of 25 propagules per period: number
of leaves, number of roots, length of the longest leaf,
and length of the longest root. Only roots exceeding 0.5
cm in length and fully expanded leaves were measured. This
selection was necessary due to the presence of non-sprouted propagules
and seeds that did not germinate during the experiment.
