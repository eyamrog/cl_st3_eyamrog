In addition to the affectionate response, which may be interpreted
as a strategy for promoting group proximity, Figure 5 indicates
a high frequency of the clapping emoji, typically used by
participants to acknowledge task completion and serve as positive reinforcement
within the group. This form of feedback can be regarded
as a mechanism to enhance interpersonal closeness and maintain group
cohesion. The Clapping Hands, Thumbs-Up, Winking Face, Face With Tears
of Joy, and Smiling Face With Smiling Eyes emojis were
predominantly used by female participants as non-verbal communication tools to
compensate for the lack of physical gestures present in face-to-face
interactions. As noted by Alshenqeeti (2016, p. 64), visual forms
of language, including non-verbal communication such as body language, have
historically been employed to support and reinforce verbal language, and
emojis represent the adaptation of these visual forms to digital
communication contexts.
