Materials and Methods: This study employed a cross-sectional, observational, and
descriptive design with prospective inclusion, utilizing a non-probabilistic convenience sampling
method. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they had a
confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and were admitted to the Internal
Medicine Service of JB Iturraspe Hospital in Santa Fe, Argentina,
between May 10 and July 20, 2021. A 5-minute resting
ECG Holter recording was obtained for each participant, and frequency
domain variables were analyzed using Fourier transform analysis with Kubios
software. The data presented include heart rate variability (HRV) frequency
measures: low-frequency power (LF), high-frequency power (HF), and normalized units
LFnu and HFnu. Patients were excluded if they had a
diagnosis of diabetes mellitus for more than five years, were
receiving beta-blocker therapy, or had a history of neck irradiation.
