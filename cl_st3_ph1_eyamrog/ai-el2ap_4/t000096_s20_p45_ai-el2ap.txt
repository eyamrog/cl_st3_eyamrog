Content Management Systems (CMS) for learning are a component of
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) that support educational processes. While
CMS are commonly utilized in virtual learning environments, they also
serve as a supplementary tool in face-to-face instruction by assisting
teachers in organizing and structuring course content (García-Valcárcel, 2009). Consequently,
it is essential for teachers to possess the requisite skills
to effectively leverage ICT, as this can facilitate various cognitive
outcomes and enhance students’ attitudes, imagination, and creativity throughout the
teaching-learning process (De la Torre, 2010).
