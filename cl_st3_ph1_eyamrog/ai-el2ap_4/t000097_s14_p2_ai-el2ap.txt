A search was conducted in five databases: Cochrane Library, PubMed
Central®, ScienceDirect, Scopus Elsevier, and Web of Science - Main
Collection. The search descriptors are presented in Table 1. All
titles and abstracts identified through the electronic search were independently
and blindly screened by two researchers (JS, VBL) between January
and February 2021. These researchers are affiliated with the Laboratório
de Pesquisa em Lazer e Atividade Física – LAPLAF/CNPq (Leisure
and Physical Activity Research Laboratory) in Brazil. Rayyan software (Intelligent
Systematic Review) was utilized to facilitate the selection process. Any
discrepancies between the reviewers were resolved by a third researcher
(ACAG). Additionally, the reference lists of all relevant articles were
examined to identify further eligible studies.
