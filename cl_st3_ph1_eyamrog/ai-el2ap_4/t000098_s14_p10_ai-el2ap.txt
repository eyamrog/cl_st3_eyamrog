Information from the other eight countries—Chile, Ecuador, the USA, India,
Indonesia, Pakistan, the Czech Republic, and Turkey—among the 28 countries
is more heterogeneous, particularly with respect to the age groups
of the deceased, as each country employs different criteria to
define age categories. While this variability somewhat limits the comparability
of results, it does not preclude the calculation of adjusted
mortality rates, since population data are available with sufficient disaggregation
to match any defined age brackets. With the exception of
the USA, for which data were compiled by INED, information
for these countries was obtained using the same case-by-case procedure
described in the previous paragraph, primarily from the websites of
national health authorities. Notably, India and Pakistan are exceptions: for
Pakistan, data were sourced from the website of the Pakistan
Institute of Development Economics (PIDE), while for India, the Hindustan
Times, a major national newspaper, provided data citing the Ministry
of Health and Family Welfare.
