To achieve the objective of this research, a qualitative approach
with an exploratory-descriptive scope was employed to characterize and identify
the most significant features of each curriculum module (Hernández, Fernández,
& Baptista, 2010). A documentary research design was implemented, encompassing
all relevant information records (Méndez & Astudillo, 2008), and involved
the systematic search, retrieval, analysis, evaluation, and interpretation of data
obtained from Internet sources (Arias, 2012).
