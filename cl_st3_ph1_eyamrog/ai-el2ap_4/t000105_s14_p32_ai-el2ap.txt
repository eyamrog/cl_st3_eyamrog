At the end of each shift (morning and afternoon), blood
samples were inspected, packed in a thermal box, and transported
to the Epidemiology Laboratory of the Medical School at the
Federal University of Ouro Preto for processing and storage by
the technical team. In the laboratory, serum tubes were centrifuged
at 2500 rpm for 15 minutes, yielding approximately 3 mL
of serum per sample. The serum was then aliquoted into
separate polypropylene tubes, with one tube containing a 50 μL
aliquot designated for COVID-19 testing and the remaining serum divided
into aliquots of approximately 500 μL to 1000 μL for
other biochemical analyses. All serum aliquots were stored in a
freezer at -80°C until further use. The EDTA tube was
stored in a -20°C freezer for subsequent extraction of genetic
material.
