The questions regarding personal information were designed to collect data
necessary for the registration and reporting of serological test results
to the Ministry of Health via the electronic epidemiological surveillance
system for notifications to the Unified Health System (e-SUS VE),
thereby supporting the monitoring and analysis of the COVID-19 epidemiological
situation in the municipalities. The remaining questions evaluated the living
conditions of the population, enabling a situational analysis of health
determinants.
