A total of 68 patients were included in the study,
of whom 62% were male and 38% were female. The
mean age was 48.9 ± 13.3 years. The median systolic
blood pressure (SBP) was 120 mmHg (range: 95–170 mmHg), and
the median diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was 80 mmHg (range:
60–110 mmHg). The mean heart rate was 76 ± 13
beats per minute, and the median respiratory rate was 24
breaths per minute (range: 16–40). Anosmia was present in 22%
of patients (n = 15), and dysgeusia was observed in
19% (n = 13).
