João ignorou Mariaj enquanto elaj estava no celular. [John ignored
Maryj while shej was on the phone.] In this example,
the pronoun "ela" ("she") in the subordinate clause refers unambiguously
to Maria, as indicated by the co-indexation. The sentence structure
allows for a clear interpretation in which João is the
subject performing the action of ignoring, and Maria is the
object being ignored, while the subordinate clause specifies that Maria
was using the phone at the time. This construction demonstrates
the syntactic and referential mechanisms in Brazilian Portuguese that facilitate
the identification of pronominal antecedents within complex sentences.
