A multidimensional evaluation in academic institutions, as currently implemented by
CAPES, is not a novel concept. This approach was first
introduced in Europe in 2008, where a multidimensional ranking system
was proposed (VAN VUGHT and ZIEGELE, 2012). The selection of
appropriate dimensions and indicators is a critical aspect of this
evaluation process, as is the preliminary assessment of the degree
of independence among these dimensions and indicators. The present evaluation
conducted by CAPES primarily emphasizes the "Research" dimension of the
"U-Multirank" framework. Therefore, analyzing the correlations between this dimension and
other dimensions is relevant for providing an initial estimate of
potential outcomes in the context of a multidimensional evaluation in
Brazil.
