The sentences used in the study featured a person’s name
as the subject, a verb in the simple past tense,
another person’s name as the object, the temporal conjunction "when"
(or "cuando" in Spanish and "quando" in Portuguese), followed by
a third-person pronoun in the subject position (or ellipsis in
Portuguese and Spanish), another verb in the simple past tense,
and a third-person pronoun as the object. The verbs were
selected from a database of verbal constructions (Baptista, 2013) that
require a human agent as the subject, a human patient
as the object, and no additional complement. Participants were asked
to select one of three possible antecedents for the reduced
(pronoun or zero) subject of the subordinate clause: (a) the
subject of the main clause, (b) the object of the
main clause, or (c) another referent not mentioned in the
main clause.
