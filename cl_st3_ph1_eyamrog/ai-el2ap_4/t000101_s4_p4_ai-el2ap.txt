In Brazil’s 2021 federal government, senior political positions offer relatively
low salaries compared to equivalent roles in the private sector,
particularly given the high cost of living in Brasília. Under
these circumstances, appointing civil servants, who already receive a base
salary, would appear to be the most straightforward solution. However,
due to a lack of trust in the established bureaucracy
by President Bolsonaro and his ministers, these positions are predominantly
filled by individuals from the military and the evangelical church.
As a result, the bureaucracy continues to experience frequent reshuffling,
with ongoing requests for the new appointees to resign.
