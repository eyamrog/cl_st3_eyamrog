Since 2018, breast cancer has been recognized as the most
prevalent type of cancer among women worldwide, accounting for over
24% of all cancer cases diagnosed in the global female
population that year, with approximately 2.1 million new cases. It
has also been identified as the fifth leading cause of
cancer-related mortality. Current evidence indicates that physical activity may serve
as an adjunct therapy, offering health benefits to women undergoing
breast cancer treatment as well as those in the post-treatment
phase. Furthermore, engagement in physical activity has been shown to
be significantly associated with improved outcomes during the postoperative stage
in this population.
