Bauer and Becker (2020) examine how populist governments have interacted
with public administration by analyzing cases from Hungary, Peru, the
United States, and Switzerland. They identify four primary approaches to
public bureaucracy: capture, dismantling, sabotage, and reform. Their analysis employs
a matrix that cross-tabulates the populist’s perception of the state
(positive or negative) with the robustness of the country’s administrative
order (fragile or robust). According to their findings, when a
populist leader holds a negative view of the state and
the administrative order is fragile, the likely outcome is the
dismantling of public administration, as observed in Peru under Fujimori.
This article will present evidence suggesting that a similar pattern
occurred in Brazil under Bolsonaro, consistent with the findings of
Sabourin et al. (2020) regarding family farming policies.
