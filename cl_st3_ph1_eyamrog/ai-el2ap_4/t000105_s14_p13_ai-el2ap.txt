The videos explaining the project theme were distributed to community
health agents, who were responsible for providing guidance to coordinators
in the census sectors of areas with the highest levels
of social vulnerability, which had been randomly selected during the
initial stage of the survey in both cities. All videos
were produced using language accessible to the target audience and
included information on the specific roles of each professional within
the data collection team.
