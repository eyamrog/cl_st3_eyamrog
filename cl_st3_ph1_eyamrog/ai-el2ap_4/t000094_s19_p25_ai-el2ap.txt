When the upper section of a page contains text and
the lower section contains one or more images, the text
assumes a primary ideological role, while the images serve a
secondary function, providing specification, evidence, or illustrating practical consequences. Conversely,
when one or more images occupy the top section of
the page, the visually presented content conveys the primary, ideologically
foregrounded message, and the accompanying text functions to elaborate or
clarify this visual information.
