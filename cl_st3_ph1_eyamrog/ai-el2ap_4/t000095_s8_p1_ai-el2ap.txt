By the end of June 2021, over 504,000 COVID-19-related deaths
had been reported in Brazil, with the number continuing to
rise rapidly. At this time, the state of Rio de
Janeiro exhibited the second-highest COVID-19 mortality rate in the country,
at 329 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. Despite being the second-largest
economy in Brazil, following SÃ£o Paulo, the relatively high mortality
rate observed in Rio de Janeiro compared to other states
remains insufficiently explained.
