The analysis indicates that face emojis are frequently used as
social affective markers and are often integrated into interactions categorized
as cognitive and teaching presence. This finding aligns with previous
research by Garrison et al. (2007), Molinari (2010), Celani and
Collins (2005), and Beuchot and Bullen (2005), who identify social
presence as a foundational component of cognitive presence. Therefore, it
can be concluded that emojis, similar to written discourse and
emoticons, function as elements in online interactions that may facilitate
cognitive presence.
