Based on Table 3, the dispersion, as measured by the
coefficient of variation of the adjusted mortality rates, is greater
than that of the crude rates. This suggests that crude
rates tend to converge due to the offsetting effects of
different underlying factors; specifically, higher mortality within certain age groups
in some countries is counterbalanced by a younger population structure
that is less susceptible to severe cases. In addition to
the disparities observed between the three groups of countries, there
is also significant internal disparity within these groups. For example,
the adjusted mortality rate in Mexico is 89% higher than
in Chile, while in England and Wales it exceeds that
of Germany by 223%.
