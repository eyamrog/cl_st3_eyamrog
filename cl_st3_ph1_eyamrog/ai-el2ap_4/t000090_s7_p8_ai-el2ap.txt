To conduct this study, it is first necessary to define
the concept of “best performers” within the context of U-Multirank.
This is a complex issue, as U-Multirank was specifically designed
to avoid producing an overall ranking, as previously discussed. The
ranking system comprises multiple Dimensions, each with a different number
of Indicators, and many Indicators contain missing data. When a
general classification of academic institutions is required, or when identifying
the “best performers” in a specific country (https://www.umultirank.org/university-rankings/top-performing-universities/2020/), U-Multirank bases
this classification on the number of “A” grades (the highest
grade) an institution receives, using other grades only to resolve
ties. This approach is problematic because it does not adequately
distinguish between grades “B,” “E,” or cases of missing data.
In this paper, two alternative methods for generating a general
ranking are considered. The first method involves calculating the simple
average of all 36 Indicators measured by U-Multirank, which has
the advantage of utilizing all available data and thus acknowledges
institutions’ efforts to report data, even if they do not
achieve an “A” grade. However, this method disproportionately weights Dimensions
with more Indicators, as their influence on the final ranking
is greater. To address this issue, a second method is
proposed: first, the average is calculated within each Dimension, and
then the average of the five resulting Dimension scores is
computed. Although no method provides a perfect solution for constructing
a general ranking using U-Multirank, which is sometimes necessary and
is also performed by U-Multirank itself, this study adopts the
second method to select the top 300 performers in Europe
in 2020, as presented in Appendix 1, because it assigns
equal weight to each Dimension.
