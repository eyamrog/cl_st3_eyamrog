This is not to suggest that forms of resistance, such
as voice, shirking, or sabotage, are absent. Indeed, some research
participants provided examples of resistance, with the most frequently cited
instance being the deliberate stalling of administrative processes in anticipation
that leadership changes or shifting priorities would eventually render the
issue obsolete. Additionally, there were cases in which bureaucrats engaged
in opposition to the government outside of their official duties
and working hours. However, even in these instances, participants consistently
reported experiencing fear.
