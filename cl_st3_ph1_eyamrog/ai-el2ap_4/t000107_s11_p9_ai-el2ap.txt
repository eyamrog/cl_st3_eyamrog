Alves and Vasconcellos (2016), building on previous bibliometric research, extended
the mapping conducted by Pagano and Vasconcellos (2003) by utilizing
internet search engines to increase access to scholarly publications. Their
study examined the period from 2006 to 2010 and employed
Portuguese-language keywords on the Domínio Público website, following the methodology
of Pagano and Vasconcellos (2003). The primary distinction between the
two studies, aside from differences in data sources, was Alves
and Vasconcellos’ (2016) emphasis on identifying translation studies that intersect
with systemic functional linguistics and corpus linguistics. In both studies,
the reliance on keywords was found to hinder the accurate
classification of the disciplinary fields of the identified works, as
titles and keywords frequently did not accurately reflect the actual
research domain. Consequently, there was a lack of correspondence between
the topics addressed in the retrieved works and the keywords
used in the searches. This misalignment between keywords and research
focus presents significant challenges for cataloging, determining theoretical affiliations, and
assigning works to appropriate disciplinary fields within the mapping of
translation studies.
