<> represents the cumulative number of deaths that country i
would experience in each age group j, calculated using the
mortality rate observed in country i for that age group
and the hypothetical population size that country i would have
in age group j if all countries shared the same
age composition. In this study, the age distribution was standardized
according to the global population age pyramid.
