The publication of study protocols is widely recognized for enhancing
research transparency and reducing publication bias. When made publicly available,
these protocols serve as important research tools by facilitating the
reproducibility of interventions by other researchers and enabling the scientific
community to track developments within a specific field. However, despite
these advantages, not all clinical trials publish the protocols for
physical activity interventions that have been implemented as research instruments.
