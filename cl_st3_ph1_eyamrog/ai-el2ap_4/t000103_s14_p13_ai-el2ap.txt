The examples above are drawn from a set of sentences
constructed to exhibit a "neutral" combination of verbs, meaning that
minimal or no semantic interference is expected between verb selection
and the reference resolution strategy employed. Half of the sentences
in the experimental set were designed with this neutrality in
mind. The remaining half consisted of "tendentious" verb pairs, in
which the combination of verbs is expected to bias reference
resolution toward either the subject or the complement of the
main clause. For instance, sentence (11) was constructed to elicit
a preference for resolving the anaphor as referring to the
subject of the main clause, whereas sentence (12) was intended
to favor resolution toward the complement of the main clause.
