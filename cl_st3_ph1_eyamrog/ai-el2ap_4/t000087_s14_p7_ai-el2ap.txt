Approximately 3 million paired-end reads were generated and processed using
the ncov2019-artic-nf pipeline (GitHub, 2021) with default parameters. The resulting
reconstructed genome, in FASTA format, was subsequently analyzed using the
Pangolin COVID-19 Lineage Assigner (Oâ€™Toole et al., 2021) to determine
the lineage of the sequenced virus.
