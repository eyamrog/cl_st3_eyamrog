A total of 806 articles were identified in the initial
database search, comprising 290 from Science Direct, 46 from Web
of Science, 87 from Scopus, 170 from Cochrane, and 213
from PubMed. After the removal of 102 duplicate records, 704
articles remained. Screening of titles and abstracts resulted in the
exclusion of 686 articles that did not meet the inclusion
criteria, were classified as different study types, or involved populations
with other diseases. Consequently, 18 articles were selected for full-text
review, after which one additional article was excluded.
