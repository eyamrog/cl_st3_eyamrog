Pleroma heteromallum is widely distributed in the southeastern and northeastern
regions of Brazil, with less frequent occurrences in the central-western
region (Guimarães 1997). In the state of Minas Gerais, P.
heteromallum has been recorded at elevations ranging from 700 to
1700 meters (Guimarães 1997). In contrast, Pleroma tedescoi is restricted
to Espírito Santo State, where it is found at elevations
between 1700 and 1800 meters (Meirelles et al. 2012). A
summary and comparison of the main distinguishing characters of these
species are provided in Table 1.
