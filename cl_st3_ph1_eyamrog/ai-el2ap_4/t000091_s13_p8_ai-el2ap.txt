Valeriana officinalis is an herbaceous plant of the family Valerianaceae
(Houghton, 1999). It is commonly incorporated into phytotherapeutic products due
to its documented anxiolytic and hypnotic effects (Murphy et al.,
2010; Becker et al., 2014; Farah et al., 2019). Reported
pharmacological activities include the promotion of central nervous system relaxation,
reduction of stress and anxiety, and improvement of sleep quality,
with minimal or negligible side effects (Behboodi et al., 2016;
Farah et al., 2019).
