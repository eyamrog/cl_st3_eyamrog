The physical outcomes most frequently assessed in the study protocols
included the physical conditions and limitations experienced by women with
breast cancer, such as reduced upper limb function, decreased range
of motion and muscle strength, and cardiovascular effects. In nearly
all studies, disease-related limitations were examined due to concerns regarding
the patientsâ€™ ability to resume daily activities. The Disabilities of
the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) test, the 30-second Sitting-Rising
Test (30s-SRT), and the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) were the
most commonly utilized assessment tools. These instruments are characterized by
their low cost and ease of administration.
