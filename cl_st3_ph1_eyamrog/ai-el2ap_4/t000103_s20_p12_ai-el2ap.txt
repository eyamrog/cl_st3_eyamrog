A comparison of the results presented in Tables 2 and
3 indicates that participants’ responses were affected by the presence
of biased sentences. When the verb combination aligned with a
preference for PAS in cases of anaphora, the corresponding percentages
increased. Conversely, when the verb combination favored a preference contrary
to PAS, as in cases of cataphora, participants’ choices shifted
accordingly. The data suggest that participants were generally more influenced
by semantic factors than by syntactic ones when resolving ambiguous
anaphora, with the exception of Brazilian participants, who continued to
be influenced by PAS in instances where there was ellipsis
in the subject position. As observed in Table 2, Table
3 shows that the alternative "other" was selected only when
the anaphor was a pronoun, particularly in cataphoric contexts; however,
in this instance, this option was chosen exclusively by Portuguese
students.
