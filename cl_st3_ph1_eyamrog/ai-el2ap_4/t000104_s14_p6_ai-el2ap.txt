Sampling was conducted on October 19, 2020, during a dry
period, defined as the absence of rainfall in the 48
hours preceding collection, in order to prevent the occurrence of
waterspoutsâ€”a phenomenon in which upstream rainfall leads to a sudden
increase in river flow. This precaution was necessary both to
ensure the safety of the researchers and to minimize potential
confounding effects on the study results due to the possible
displacement of organisms (BUSS, 2008). Samples were collected at three
sites (Figure 1): P1, located upstream of public use areas
and serving as a reference site; P2, situated at the
main bathing site; and P3, located at the secondary bathing
site.
