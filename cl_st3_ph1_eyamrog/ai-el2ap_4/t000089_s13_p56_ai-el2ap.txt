This does not imply, however, that denominational education entirely precludes
the possibility of critical assessment of various religious and non-religious
worldviews. As demonstrated by the evidence presented above, both the
Catholic Church and the Church of Ireland have expressed a
commitment to equipping pupils with the ability to evaluate truth
and moral claims from different religions, which is reflected in
the inclusion of dedicated sections on other faith traditions within
their curricula. Terence McLaughlin (1990) has argued that a religious
upbringing that allows for questioning and consideration of alternative perspectives
does not conflict with the principles of liberal autonomy. Given
that the process of child upbringing inherently involves the transmission
of specific teachings and moral values, as well as participation
in practices and activities that foster a sense of familiarity
and security, it follows that denominational schooling does not, in
itself, constitute a violation of childrenâ€™s basic rights.
