Increased respiration rates during plant development may enhance electron flux
within mitochondria, leading to elevated production of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) (MÃ¸ller 2001). ROS play a role in cell signaling
pathways and regulate the expression of genes associated with seed
germination, seedling development, and bud dormancy release (Bailly et al.
2008; Kranner et al. 2010; Considine & Foyer 2014). Therefore,
the observed respiration patterns in seeds and NS in this
study may be linked to variations in mitochondrial ROS levels,
which could directly affect seedling and plant development from NS.
