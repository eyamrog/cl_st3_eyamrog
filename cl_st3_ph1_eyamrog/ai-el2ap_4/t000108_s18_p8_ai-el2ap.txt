Pleroma heteromallum (D. Don) D. Don and Pleroma tedescoi (Meirelles)
are two species within the genus Pleroma, which is part
of the family Melastomataceae. These species are of particular interest
due to their distinct morphological characteristics and their distribution within
specific ecological regions. Accurate identification and classification of these taxa
are essential for further studies on their phylogeny, ecology, and
potential conservation status.
