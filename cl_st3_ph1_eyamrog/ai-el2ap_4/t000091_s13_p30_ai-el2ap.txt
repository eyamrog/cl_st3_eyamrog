A study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of passionflower
in reducing anxiety during dental procedures. The study included sixty-three
patients classified as having moderate, high, or severe anxiety according
to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) criteria, all of
whom required periodontal treatment. Participants were divided into three groups:
the first group received 20 drops of passionflower extract the
night before and 20 drops the morning of the treatment
(at least 90 minutes prior to the procedure); the second
group received a placebo administered in the same manner; and
the third group received no medication. The results indicated that
premedication with passionflower was significantly effective in reducing anxiety compared
to the placebo and no-treatment groups (Kaviani et al., 2013).
