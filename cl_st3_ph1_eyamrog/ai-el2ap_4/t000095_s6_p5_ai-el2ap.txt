São Paulo ranks second and Rio de Janeiro fourth in
monthly household income per capita, with values of R$ 1,814
and R$ 1,723, respectively. In the first quarter of 2021,
the employment rate among individuals over 16 years of age
was 67.1% in São Paulo and 63.6% in Rio de
Janeiro. Although economic differences are present, they are relatively small
and do not fully account for the substantial disparities in
mortality observed between these locations. Additionally, the proportion of the
population registered in the Cadastro Único—a program available to families
with a monthly income less than or equal to half
the minimum wage—was 12.2% in São Paulo and 8.9% in
Rio de Janeiro. While it is important to note that
these records may not capture the full extent of family
vulnerability, the data suggest that São Paulo is not less
vulnerable than Rio de Janeiro. Previous research has demonstrated that
vulnerability is associated with increased COVID-19 mortality. For example, in
Belo Horizonte, another metropolitan city in Southeast Brazil, overall mortality
among adults aged 60 years and older was 292 per
100,000, with rates increasing from 179 in low vulnerability areas
to 354 in intermediate and 476 in high vulnerability areas.
