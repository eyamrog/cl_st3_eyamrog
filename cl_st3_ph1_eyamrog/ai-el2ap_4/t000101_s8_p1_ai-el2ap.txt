During his first 100 days in office, Jair Bolsonaro issued
an executive order widely referred to in Brazil as the
“revogaço,” which resulted in the annulment of 250 executive orders
enacted by his predecessors since 1901. Similarly, within the first
24 hours of his administration, Joe Biden signed 15 new
executive orders, many of which reversed policies implemented by Donald
Trump. While these actions may appear comparable and could be
interpreted as typical outcomes of democratic transitions, a closer examination
of the Brazilian federal government reveals that the extent and
characteristics of policy dismantling under Bolsonaro differ significantly from standard
post-election policy changes that typically follow a change in the
ruling political party.
