To obtain an approximate representation of locations where citizens reside,
work, engage in consumption, and participate in leisure activities, GIS
tools integrated within Repast were utilized. This spatial information, combined
with data on daily movements, was used to characterize the
social interaction patterns of each Ha. These patterns were identified
based on 441 individual field surveys, which were conducted in
accordance with age and sex quotas and adhered to the
requirements set by the Ethics Committee regarding survey design, data
anonymization, and informed consent.
