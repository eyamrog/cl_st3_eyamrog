This proposal for a Master's Program in ICT-mediated Learning Management
is based on a relevance and demand study conducted by
the UMAYUK research group at UNACH. The study identified a
limited availability of master's programs in Ecuador that focus on
developing teachers' digital skills, particularly in online formats, despite scientific
literature indicating significant potential for ensuring formal learning through such
modalities (Martín, Mora, Añorbe, & González, 2017; Quiroz, 2017).
