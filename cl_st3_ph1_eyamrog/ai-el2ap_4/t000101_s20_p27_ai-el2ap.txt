Initially, I anticipated that the Bolsonaro administration would immediately implement
abrupt dismissals and exclude existing personnel; however, this prediction was
incorrect. Instead, the administration gradually consolidated control over the state
apparatus through a slow and incremental process. As a result,
at present, none of my colleagues hold political appointment positions
within this government, as they have been systematically removed due
to their previous roles in earlier administrations. Additionally, military officers
within the Cabinet for Institutional Security (GSI) reportedly monitor individualsâ€™
social media accounts, and if any content is perceived as
left-leaning, such individuals are not approved for appointments (interview 04).
