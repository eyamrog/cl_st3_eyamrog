Due to the heterogeneous structure of AbCSim, each submodel employs
distinct mechanisms for parameter acquisition, adjustment, and adaptation. Certain constants
were sourced directly from the literature, whereas others were calibrated
using a grid search approach by comparing simulation outputs with
available empirical data.
