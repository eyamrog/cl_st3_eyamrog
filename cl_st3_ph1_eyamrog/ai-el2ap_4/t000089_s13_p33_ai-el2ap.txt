Given that specific vocabularies are defined in accordance with the
objectives of mutual understanding, an approach to linguistic communities that
remains open to the possibility of transcending its own context
should inform all educational initiatives. According to Maeve Cooke (2001,
p. 14), the ongoing pursuit by citizens of new semantic
meanings that exceed existing justifications is grounded in a recognition
of the resistance of reality to complete conceptual capture. This
resistance motivates efforts toward semantic and normative innovation, undertaken by
citizens to achieve a more comprehensive conception of social justice.
Consequently, a purely epistemic account of moral validity is insufficient
to justify the search for context-transcendent reasons through processes of
meaning exchange with individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds. In this
framework, the invocation of various historical and religious narratives should
serve not as an end in itself, but as a
means to facilitate the intersubjective reconstruction of scientific and moral
validity claims. Furthermore, since the process of linguistic reconstruction is
oriented toward truth, the outcomes of moral deliberation should enable
changes in perspectives, thereby contributing to the integration of different
cultures into a broader political unity. Thus, through the evaluation
of ethical norms and conceptions of truth, participants contribute to
shaping the public sphere by fostering collective values, which may
involve advancing or revising their particular cultural or religious moral
perspectives within deliberative processes.
