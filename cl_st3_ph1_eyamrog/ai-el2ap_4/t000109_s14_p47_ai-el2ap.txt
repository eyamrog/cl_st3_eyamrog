This submodel represents the probability of an individual (Ha) becoming
infected through contact with surfaces previously contaminated by another infected
individual. Studies have indicated that plastics are among the most
common materials encountered in daily human activities [44][45]. On such
surfaces, the virus can persist for a duration that decreases
exponentially with increasing ambient temperature. If an infected individual remains
in a specific location for more than 16 minutes, there
is a likelihood of leaving infectious residues on objects handled
(fomites). This process can be mathematically described as 𝑃(𝑡) =
𝑒^(−𝑏𝑡), where 𝑃(𝑡) represents the probability of viral persistence over
time t, and b is a decay constant [44].
