On the Catálogo de Teses e Dissertações da CAPES website,
three separate searches were conducted using different keywords and filters.
The first search employed the keyword "tradução" (translation) and applied
the following filters: arts, human sciences, language studies, translation studies,
linguistic studies, letters, classical letters, linguistics, linguistics and literature, medicine,
and medicine I. This search yielded only one dissertation. The
second search used the keywords "tradução médica" (medical translation) with
the filters language studies, letters, linguistics, and linguistics and arts,
resulting in the retrieval of four theses and two dissertations.
The third search utilized the keywords "tradução artigos científicos" (translation
scientific articles) and the filters human sciences, letters, letters and
arts, linguistics, and linguistics and literature, which identified three theses
and one dissertation. However, the dissertation identified in the third
search had already been retrieved in the second search. Therefore,
a total of 10 unique studies met the selection criteria,
comprising eight theses and two dissertations. The results are summarized
in Table 3.
