To address this issue, an alternative method for general evaluation
is proposed, which involves first calculating the average scores within
each Dimension, followed by computing the overall average using the
mean scores of each Dimension. This approach assigns equal weight
to each Dimension while allowing for different weights to be
applied to the individual Indicators.
