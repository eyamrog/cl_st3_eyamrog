Plan the search for scientific information by systematically identifying relevant
sources and collecting content that directly supports the research objectives.
This process should involve the use of appropriate databases, the
application of well-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the critical
evaluation of the quality and relevance of the selected materials
to ensure that the information gathered is both meaningful and
conducive to advancing the research process.
