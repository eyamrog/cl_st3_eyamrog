Another primary objective of this study is to determine whether
institutions tend to concentrate on specific dimensions and indicators or
exhibit a uniform performance across all dimensions. This analysis is
conducted using the 300 highest-performing institutions in Europe, as these
institutions generally possess more comprehensive datasets, particularly within the European
context, thereby reducing issues associated with missing data.
