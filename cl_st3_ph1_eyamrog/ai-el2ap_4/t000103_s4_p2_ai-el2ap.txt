A total of 181 participants completed an online survey in
which they identified the antecedent of the anaphor in 16
ambiguous sentences. The study evaluated the Position of Antecedent Strategy
(PAS) across three languages and compared the relative influence of
semantic and syntactic factors on the resolution of ambiguous anaphora.
