Following an explanation of the research process and the participant’s
agreement to participate, informed consent was obtained. Venous blood was
then collected by a phlebotomist via venipuncture in the antecubital
fossa, with the participant seated and the arm positioned on
an appropriate support. For serum collection, a 7.5 mL S-Monovette®
(Sarstedt) serum gel tube was used; the resulting serum was
utilized for the COVID-19 rapid test and additional biochemical analyses.
For molecular biology analyses, whole blood was collected in a
2.7 mL S-Monovette® (Sarstedt) tube containing sodium fluoride/EDTA.
