In 1569, the Spanish explorer Monardus identified Passiflora incarnata (Passifloraceae),
commonly known as passion fruit or passionflower (Dhawan, Kumar &
Sharma, 2001; Fajemiroye et al., 2016). This species has demonstrated
sedative and anxiolytic properties (Dhawan, Kumar & Sharma, 2001; Carlini,
2003; Miroddi et al., 2013; da Cunha et al., 2021)
and has been utilized in the treatment of anxiety, insomnia,
drug dependence, mild infections, and pain (Schunck et al., 2017).
Furthermore, Passiflora incarnata has been reported to be effective in
managing anxiety associated with dental procedures (Kaviani et al., 2013;
da Cunha et al., 2021).
