Table 3 presents the matrix values 𝐴ℎ,𝑒,𝑙 for the Hidden
Markov Model (HMM) corresponding to a specific neighborhood l, for
the age group 0 (Children) and time slot 0 (Morning).
In this context, a0,0,l(i, j) represents the probability that a
child (e = 0) from neighborhood l, during the morning
(h = 0), transitions from state i (row) to state
j (column). Specifically, a0,0,l(1, 2) = 25 indicates the probability
value (multiplied by 1000) that a child from neighborhood l,
within time slot 0, leaves a work/study location (state 1)
and moves to a leisure location (state 2). Appendix A
provides the complete set of probability matrices A and B
for all age groups, time slots, and neighborhoods defined in
AbCSim, corresponding to the first phase of the Preventive and
Mandatory Social Isolation (PMSI) implemented by the Argentine National Government.
