The limitations of this study include the restriction of the
sample to two medium-sized Brazilian cities, which together account for
only 12.2% of Brazilian municipalities. Additionally, residents of rural areas
within these municipalities were excluded from participation. The response rate
was 33.5%, which is lower than the rates reported in
national surveys conducted in Brazil (53â€“54%) and Spain (60%) [28,30],
although the refusal rate was within the expected range. Furthermore,
in 41.5% of households, data could not be collected due
to the absence of residents at the time of the
survey.
