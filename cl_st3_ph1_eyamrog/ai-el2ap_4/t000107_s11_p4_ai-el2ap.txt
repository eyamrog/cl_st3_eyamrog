Numerous studies have employed bibliometric methods to assess researcher productivity
across various academic disciplines (Ribeiro, 2017). For instance, previous research
has examined fields such as administration, tourism, and accounting. Additionally,
the field of bibliometrics has itself been analyzed through bibliometric
studies (Vasconcelos, 2014; Ribeiro, 2017).
