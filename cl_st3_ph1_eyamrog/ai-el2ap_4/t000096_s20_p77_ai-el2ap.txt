Science is characterized by its systematic approach to acquiring knowledge
through observation, experimentation, and logical reasoning. The scientific method involves
the formulation of hypotheses, the collection and analysis of empirical
data, and the drawing of conclusions that can be tested
and replicated. This process is guided by objectivity, transparency, and
critical evaluation. Different paradigms within science, such as positivism, interpretivism,
and critical theory, offer distinct frameworks for interpreting and transforming
reality. Positivism emphasizes empirical observation and quantifiable data, interpretivism focuses
on understanding the subjective meanings and experiences of individuals, and
critical theory seeks to identify and challenge power structures and
social inequalities. These paradigms influence the selection of research methods,
the interpretation of findings, and the application of scientific knowledge
to address real-world problems.
