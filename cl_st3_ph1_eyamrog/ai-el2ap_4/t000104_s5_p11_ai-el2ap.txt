The sampling of organisms within mesohabitats was appropriate, as these
areas support the establishment and presence of benthic macroinvertebrates by
providing essential resources such as food, breeding sites, and physical
substrates. However, variation in these factors can influence the distribution
of organisms across different mesohabitat locations (Gorni and Alves, 2012).
Additionally, due to their limited mobility, these organisms serve as
effective spatial indicators of habitat disturbances (Beghelli et al., 2012).
