Pleroma eglanduliferum Justino & P.J.F. Guim., sp. nov., a new
species of Melastomataceae (Melastomateae) from the Atlantic Forest in Minas
Gerais State, Brazil, is described and illustrated, with its affinities
and diagnostic characters discussed. Pleroma eglanduliferum is closely related to
P. heteromallum (D. Don) D. Don and P. tedescoi (Meirelles,
L. Kollmann & R. Goldenb.) P.J.F. Guim. & Michelang., sharing
similar plant architecture, including quadrangular branches and comparable leaf shape
and indumentum. However, it can be distinguished from these species
by differences in stamen morphology and the size of the
bracteoles. Pleroma eglanduliferum should be classified as Critically Endangered, as
it is currently known from only a single population in
a restricted area.
