To identify the types of emojis used to support cognitive
presence, frequency distributions were calculated for all interactions. The results
indicated that the Clapping Hands emoji was the most frequently
used (n = 105), followed by the Smiling Face With
Smiling Eyes emoji (n = 51), Thumbs-Up emoji (n =
47), Smiling Face emoji (n = 47), Smiling Face With
Smiling Eyes And Three Hearts emoji (n = 40), Winking
Face emoji (n = 37), Face With Tears of Joy
emoji (n = 33), Slightly Smiling Face emoji (n =
31), and Smiling Face with Heart-Eyes emoji (n = 24;
see Appendix A). These data are visually represented in Figure
2 as an emoji cloud, where the size of each
emoji corresponds to its frequency of use by participants.
