As a consequence of the processes outlined above, a significant
number of federal bureaucrats are no longer employed within their
original areas of expertise. Instead, many have transferred to agencies
where they experience reduced public visibility and increased institutional protection.
Certain organizations, due to the technical nature of their mandates,
are generally perceived as less politically exposed and have consequently
become preferred destinations for bureaucrats seeking to avoid potential professional
risks. These institutions have attracted individuals from career tracks characterized
by higher mobility, such as members of the EPPGG. Among
diplomats, there has been a marked increase in demand for
assignments outside of Bras√≠lia, with unprecedented interest in positions traditionally
considered less desirable, including those classified as C and D
posts.
