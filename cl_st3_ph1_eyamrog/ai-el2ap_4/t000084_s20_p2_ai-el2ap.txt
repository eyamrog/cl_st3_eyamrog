Table 2 presents the original meanings of the most frequently
used emojis identified in interactions during the continuing education course.
The table includes the meanings of the emojis most commonly
associated with cognitive presence, teaching presence, and social presence. It
should be noted that, due to the high number of
emojis used to express social presence, several other emojis (e.g.,
: n = 77; : n = 71; : n
= 59; : n = 58; : n = 56;
: n = 47) were used more frequently than the
Rolling On The Floor Laughing emoji. However, these emojis did
not rank among the most frequently used for cognitive, teaching,
or social presence and were therefore not included in Table
2.
