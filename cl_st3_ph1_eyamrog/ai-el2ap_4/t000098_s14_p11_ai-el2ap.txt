A final relevant methodological point is that the numbers of
deaths used to calculate age-specific mortality rates (mij) were not
taken directly from the reported sources. When disaggregated by age
group, the reference dates for these data vary considerably and
are not consistent, even among the most developed countries included
in the study. As shown in Chart 1, despite significant
efforts, for some countries the most recent available data correspond
to dates such as 9/11/2020 for Ecuador, 10/25/2020 for Turkey,
and 11/6/2020 for Poland. Regardless of the time lag, international
comparisons require that the numbers of deaths by age group
refer to a single reference date. To achieve this temporal
standardization, the accumulated number of deaths in each country up
to 1/28/2021 was distributed according to the age-specific pattern observed
at the most recent date for which disaggregated data were
available. In other words, the observed age distribution of mortality
was extrapolated to the reference date.
