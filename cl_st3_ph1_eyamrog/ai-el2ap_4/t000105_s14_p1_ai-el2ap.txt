In this population-based serological study, a household survey was conducted
between October and December 2020, during the first wave of
the COVID-19 pandemic, in two historic cities located in Brazil's
mining region. The survey was implemented in three stages, each
separated by an interval of 21 days, with different census
sectors assessed at each stage.
