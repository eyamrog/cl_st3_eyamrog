In Cornwall, the prioritization of Christianity over other faith traditions
is justified on the basis that Christianity articulates moral perspectives
and provides a framework of meanings that informs societal norms
and practices. According to the Cornwall Council (2014, p. 12),
“Christianity shapes the lives of all citizens of the United
Kingdom irrespective of their individual beliefs. Christianity shapes our year,
our language and our culture. It continues to inform our
moral perspectives.” In addressing the development of other faith traditions,
the document emphasizes the significance of local group characteristics and
their historical evolution, thereby encouraging an approach to ethical enquiry
grounded in communal experiences. For instance, while recognizing Buddhism as
the largest non-Christian tradition in Cornwall, the document notes that
most individuals who identify as Buddhist were not born into
the tradition. Consequently, it suggests that teachers and students should
critically examine the factors contributing to the popularity of Buddhism
in Cornwall, as well as explore the connections between Cornish
Buddhism and its counterparts in Asian contexts.
