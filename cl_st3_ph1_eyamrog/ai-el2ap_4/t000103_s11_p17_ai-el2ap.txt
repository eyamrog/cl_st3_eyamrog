In addition to the salience of the anaphor, clause order
may also influence anaphora resolution. According to the Active Search
Mechanism (ASM) hypothesis proposed by Kazanina et al. (2007), in
instances of pronominal cataphora in English (as exemplified in (8)),
speakers tend to select the first potential antecedent that follows
the anaphor. Typically, this first potential antecedent corresponds to the
subject of the main clause.
