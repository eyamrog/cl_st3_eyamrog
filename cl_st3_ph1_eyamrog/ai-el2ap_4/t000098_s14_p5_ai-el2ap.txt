Calculating adjusted mortality rates requires basic data on population and
deaths disaggregated by age group and by country. Demographic data
are widely available and easily accessible. The Population Division of
the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United
Nations provides population estimates for all countries, disaggregated by single
years of age up to 99 years, with an additional
category for individuals aged 100 years or older. This study
utilizes the 2020 population estimates published by the United Nations
in August 2019 [UNITED NATIONS, 2019]. An exception applies to
England and Wales, as age-disaggregated mortality data are available only
for these two regions combined, rather than for the entire
United Kingdom, which is the unit represented in the UN
statistics. Therefore, population data for England and Wales were obtained
from the UK Office for National Statistics.
