There is substantial evidence that both the aggressiveness and lethality
of Covid-19 increase with the age of the affected individual
[GOLDSTEIN & LEE, 2020: 4; VILLANI et al., 2020: 4;
O’DRISCOLL et al., 2021: 140]. Age is the variable most
directly associated with the probability of death from Covid-19, with
mortality rates increasing exponentially with age across all countries where
this relationship has been studied [CRIMMINS, 2020: 142]. The primary
factors underlying this association are the decline in immune function
and the higher prevalence of comorbidities among older adults [VERITY
et al., 2020 apud GOUJON et al., 2020]. Age-related deterioration
of the immune system, including a reduced availability of specific
naïve T cell subsets, is particularly consequential in the context
of a novel virus. Additionally, other aspects of immune function
also decline with age. For example, deregulation in five cytokines
has been shown to double between the ages of 50
and 80, increasing the risk of uncontrolled immune responses and
hyperinflammatory processes, such as cytokine storms, which can overwhelm vital
organ systems and result in mortality [CRIMMINS, 2020: 142]. Furthermore,
the prevalence of comorbidities increases steadily with advancing age [BORGES
& CRESPO, 2020: 6].
