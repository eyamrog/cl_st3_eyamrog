At the end of 2019, a previously unidentified coronavirus was
detected in Wuhan, China; it was designated SARS-CoV-2, and the
disease it causes was named COVID-19. As the number of
cases increased, atypical symptoms for this type of virus, such
as anosmia and dysgeusia of uncertain etiology, were observed, raising
the possibility of autonomic dysfunction, specifically involving the baroreflex. In
this context, it is plausible that subclinical manifestations of baroreflex
involvement may occur. The baroreflex is regulated by the autonomic
nervous system through the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity.
The objective of this study is to determine whether patients
with COVID-19 exhibit alterations in baroreflex function, as assessed by
ECG Holter monitoring.
