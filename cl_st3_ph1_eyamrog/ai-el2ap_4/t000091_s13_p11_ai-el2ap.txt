The medicinal properties of Valeriana officinalis are primarily attributed to
its volatile oils, valepotriates, and their precursors (Houghton, 1999; Ricigliano
et al., 2016). Valerenic acid and valerenol have been shown
to enhance the activity of various recombinant GABA receptors (Becker
et al., 2014). These volatile oils inhibit the enzyme responsible
for GABA metabolism in the brain, leading to increased GABA
concentrations, which are associated with sedative effects and reduced central
nervous system activity, thereby supporting a central rather than peripheral
mechanism of action (Thomas et al., 2016).
