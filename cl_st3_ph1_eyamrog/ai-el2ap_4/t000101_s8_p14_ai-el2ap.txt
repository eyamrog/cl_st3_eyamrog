Recent developments in the policy dismantling literature have broadened the
scope of analysis to include policy changes driven by the
actions of illiberal leaders, rather than those solely resulting from
fiscal constraints or neoliberal reforms. Bauer, Peters, and Pierre (2021)
contend that populist regimes engage in reshaping administrative structures into
illiberal forms through five primary strategies: restructuring organizational frameworks, reallocating
resources, controlling personnel, promoting illiberal norms, and weakening accountability mechanisms.
Of particular relevance to this study is the third strategy,
described as the "ideological cleansing of staff" (p. 3). Furthermore,
Bauer et al. (2021) argue that democratic backsliding should be
examined not only in relation to political and judicial institutions,
but also in terms of its impact on public administration,
which plays a central role in the implementation of public
policy.
