A quantitative approach was utilized to identify the factors influencing
ambiguity resolution. A written questionnaire, adapted from Valenzuela et al.
(2011), was developed and distributed online following approval from the
relevant ethics committee. The survey was administered to undergraduate students
in the language departments at the Federal University of Rio
Grande do Sul (March 2020) and the University of Algarve
(October 2020). Additionally, the questionnaire was disseminated via Google Forms
and shared on the researchersâ€™ social media platforms to increase
participation among native speakers of English and Spanish. Participation was
both anonymous and voluntary, with respondents providing informed consent prior
to taking part in the study.
