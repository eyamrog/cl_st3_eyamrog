The higher mortality risk from COVID-19 observed in public hospitals
compared to private hospitals highlights the necessity for improved resources
and infrastructure in public healthcare services. As noted by Paim
(10), chronic underfunding of Brazil's Unified Health System (SUS) remains
a significant challenge. The Federal Government's contribution to public health
expenditure declined from 63.8% in 1995 to approximately 42% in
2017. Additionally, the creation of the Emergency Social Fund in
1994 facilitated the reallocation of 30% of the Social Security
Budget to other expenditures by 2016. Furthermore, Constitutional Amendment No.
95, enacted in 2016, imposed a federal spending cap and
effectively froze public health funding for a period of 20
years (11, 12).
