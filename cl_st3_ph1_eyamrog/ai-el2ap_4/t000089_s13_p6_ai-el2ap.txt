The relegation of matters of belief to the private sphere,
together with an egalitarian approach to education that emphasizes "shared
human values" and avoids differential treatment between majority and minority
groups, reflects a liberal perspective that distinguishes between objective and
practical knowledge. From this standpoint, the sole purpose of a
religious education (RE) syllabus is to examine the factual and
cognitive aspects of religious phenomena.
