In 2015, Ofsted conducted inspections in 22 independent faith schools
and found that at least 10 did not meet the
required curriculum standards, while four were unable to demonstrate the
promotion of fundamental British values. Ofsted reported that the schools
failing to meet curriculum standards did not provide a sufficiently
broad curriculum to support the development of pupils’ aesthetic and
creative skills. In relation to the promotion of British values,
the report indicated that the limited scope of the curriculum
restricted pupils’ opportunities to learn about other religious traditions and
beliefs. Additionally, gender-related issues were identified in some Muslim schools,
where Ofsted observed that men and women were segregated for
routine activities, and school managers did not adequately protect pupils
from exposure to literature containing extremist, sexist, or partisan views
(United Kingdom, Ofsted, 2015, pp. 15-16). The report also expressed
concern that many pupils lacked basic knowledge of British history,
politics, and institutions, with very few able to name any
political parties.
