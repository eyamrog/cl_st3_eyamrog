One study evaluated the effects of a single 1600 mg
dose of Valerian on sedation by utilizing the standardized field
sobriety test and assessing performance parameters in a driving simulator.
The results indicated that acute administration of the phytotherapeutic agent
did not impair participants' performance in the driving simulator (Thomas
et al., 2016).
