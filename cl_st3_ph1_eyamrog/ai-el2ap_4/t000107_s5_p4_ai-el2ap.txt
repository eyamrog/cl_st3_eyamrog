To address the issues outlined above, we adapted and expanded
the methodology proposed by Alves and Vasconcellos (2016). Specifically, we
conducted searches on the Domínio Público, BDTD, and CAPES websites
using not only individual keywords but also combinations of keywords,
various filters, and author name searches. These procedures facilitated the
verification of all retrieved information and optimized the search results,
thereby minimizing the risk of duplication or omission of relevant
data.
