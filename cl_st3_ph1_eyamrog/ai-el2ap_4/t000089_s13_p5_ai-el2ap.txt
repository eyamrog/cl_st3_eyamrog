In an ideal society, religious belief would remain a private
matter, and public institutions, including schools, would maintain strict neutrality
regarding religion. Schools should foster social cohesion and support an
open society grounded in shared human values, ensuring genuine inclusivity
and accommodation of both religious and non-religious needs, including those
of small minorities. Failure to uphold these principles may result
in a situation where the preferences of the majority, or
those of influential minorities, are prioritized at the expense of
others (HAI, 2001, p. 14).
