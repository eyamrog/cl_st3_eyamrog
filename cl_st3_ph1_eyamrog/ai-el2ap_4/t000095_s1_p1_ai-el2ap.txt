Objective: To compare the proportion of deaths among hospitalized COVID-19
cases in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, stratified by
private and public healthcare services. Methods: Hospitalization data for Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) were obtained from the SIVEP-Gripe Database.
The analysis included all hospitalized adults diagnosed with COVID-19 or
unspecified SARS between January and December 2020. Logistic regression models
were used to assess the risk of death between Rio
de Janeiro and São Paulo, adjusting for age, sex, and
comorbidities. Results: A total of 388,657 hospital records from Rio
de Janeiro (91,532) and São Paulo (297,125) were analyzed. The
frequency of missing data was high, particularly in Rio de
Janeiro at both the state and capital levels. After adjusting
for confounders, the odds ratio for death from COVID-19 in
Rio de Janeiro compared to São Paulo was 2.51 in
private hospitals and 2.29 in public hospitals. In the capitals,
the disparity was greater, with the lethality among hospitalized COVID-19
patients in Rio de Janeiro at least twice as high
as in São Paulo, both at the state and capital
levels. Significant differences were observed between public and private services,
with odds ratios of 2.74 and 3.46, respectively.
