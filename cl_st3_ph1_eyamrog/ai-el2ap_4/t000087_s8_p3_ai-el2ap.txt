The BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccine was the first to receive
emergency use authorization for individuals aged 16 years and older
on December 11, 2020 (Office of the Commissioner, 2021). On
March 31, 2021, it became the first vaccine to report
phase 3 clinical trial results in adolescents aged 12 to
15 years, demonstrating that it was well tolerated, safe, immunogenic,
and exhibited 100% efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 (Frenck et
al., 2021). However, limited data are available regarding the epidemiology
and clinical course of COVID-19 among adolescents, both vaccinated and
unvaccinated, in real-world settings that differ from controlled experimental conditions.
