The majority of Irish primary and secondary schools operate as
national and voluntary institutions under religious patronage, resulting in religious
education (RE) being delivered predominantly through a denominational model that
prioritizes the induction of pupils into a specific faith tradition.
In Catholic schools, RE is guided by the Irish Catholic
Bishops’ Conference, as outlined in the document Grow in Love
(2015). This framework identifies among its intended outcomes that pupils
should develop both an awareness of and knowledge about other
Christian traditions (ecumenism), as well as an understanding of selected
other religious traditions, including basic knowledge of their principal beliefs,
spiritual values, and practices (inter-religious education) (Irish Catholic Bishops’ Conference,
2015, p. 31).
