Maintaining a consistent supply of environmental goods and services through
ecosystem processes requires high water quality. However, 53% of Brazilian
cities have experienced a decline in both the quality and
quantity of water resources, with 38% of these cases attributed
to water pollution (Campanili et al., 2010). In developing countries
such as Brazil, untreated domestic and industrial effluents, as well
as agricultural runoff, are frequently discharged into water bodies (SNIS,
2017). The widespread presence of contaminants in water leads to
the degradation of riverine ecosystems, and the decomposition of organic
matter from sewage and industrial effluents results in reduced dissolved
oxygen levels, which negatively impacts aquatic species (CETESB, 2019). Additionally,
fertilizers containing high concentrations of phosphorus contribute to the eutrophication
process and promote excessive algal growth, including species capable of
producing and releasing toxins into the water (Barreto et al.,
2013). The introduction of other chemical pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals,
pesticides, and personal care products (PPCPs), in conjunction with sewage,
industrial waste, and agricultural runoff, further exacerbates water contamination (Khan,
1977; Liu et al., 2013). Moreover, the natural flow of
rivers facilitates the transport of pollutants over long distances, thereby
affecting environments far from the original source of contamination (Abessa
et al., 2018).
