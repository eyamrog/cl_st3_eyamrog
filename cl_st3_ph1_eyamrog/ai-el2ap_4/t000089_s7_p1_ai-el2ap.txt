This article examines how religious education (RE) can address the
requirements of intercultural learning within democratic contexts by analyzing various
conceptions and models of RE in Ireland and England. The
aim is to develop a normative framework that aligns with
the principles of dialogical rationality. The analysis highlights the interconnection
between cognitive and experiential knowledge and challenges the liberal perspective
that religious education should be exclusively information-based. Additionally, the article
argues that egalitarian models of religious education, when lacking a
transcendental dimension of truth-seeking, are insufficient for encouraging citizens to
broaden their cultural perspectives beyond their immediate communities. Based on
these considerations, the article advocates for an ethical-dialogical approach to
religious education, which facilitates the articulation of moral insights derived
from individual experiences of religion and supports the critical evaluation
of both religious and secular truth claims.
