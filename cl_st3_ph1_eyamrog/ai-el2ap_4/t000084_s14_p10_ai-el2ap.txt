Upon completion of the coding process, it was found that
participants used 117 unique emojis during the 8-week course. To
address the first research question and identify the types of
emojis used to support cognitive, social, and teaching presence during
course interactions, the frequency of each emoji type was calculated.
Specifically, within each group, the number of occurrences of each
emoji type was counted and summed for each Community of
Inquiry (CoI) category (e.g., Triggering Event, Emotional Expression). The emoji
counts for each CoI category were then aggregated to produce
a total for each CoI element (cognitive, teaching, or social
presence; see Table 1). This procedure was conducted for each
of the six groups, after which the data from all
groups were combined to obtain overall totals. Thus, for each
unique emoji, frequencies were calculated both within and across the
six groups for each CoI category. Each CoI category was
subsequently grouped under its corresponding CoI element to determine the
total frequency of emoji use for each presence type. In
total, 2,079 emojis were used across the groups to represent
cognitive, teaching, and social presence during the course. Emoji clouds
were generated to visually represent the data, and illustrative excerpts
from the WhatsApp course interactions were included to demonstrate how
various emojis were used to support each presence.
