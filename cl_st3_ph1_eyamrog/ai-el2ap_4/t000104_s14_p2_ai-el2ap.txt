The establishment of regulations to manage site usage and mitigate
negative impacts is essential, as tourism—including ecotourism—can still result in
significant environmental effects (RUSCHMANN, 1993). In particular, water bodies may
be contaminated by tourists through the introduction of substances such
as sunscreens, insect repellents, moisturizing creams, solid waste, and sedimentation,
among others (RUSCHMANN, 1993). This study aims to evaluate the
water quality of Cachoeira do Paraíso waterfall (Peruíbe, SP, Brazil)
through the biomonitoring of benthic macrofauna.
