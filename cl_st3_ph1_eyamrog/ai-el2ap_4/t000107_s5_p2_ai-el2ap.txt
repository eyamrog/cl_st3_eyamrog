The reliability concerns associated with the Domínio Público website arose
when theses and dissertations completed within the study’s specified timeframe
were identified via the Google search engine but were not
catalogued on the website. It is likely that the absence
of these documents on www.dominiopublico.gov.br is attributable to issues related
to insufficient or irregular updating of the database.
