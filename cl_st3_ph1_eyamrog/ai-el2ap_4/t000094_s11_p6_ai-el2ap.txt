Several scholars have examined the ways in which different modes
contribute to meaning-making in children's picturebooks (Baguley & Kerby, 2021;
Martínez Lirola, 2020; Moya Guijarro, 2014, 2016, 2019; Moya Guijarro
& Pinar, 2009; Moya Guijarro & Ruiz, 2020; Moya Guijarro
& Ventola, 2021; Painter, 2007; Salisbury & Styles, 2012). These
studies focus on the distinct roles that various modes play
in the construction of meaning, as well as on how
visual elements can complement or extend the meaning conveyed by
the written text. In some cases, visual elements are more
prominent than the written text, while in others, there is
an equilibrium between the two modes, as described by Kümmerling-Meibauer
(2018, p. 3).
