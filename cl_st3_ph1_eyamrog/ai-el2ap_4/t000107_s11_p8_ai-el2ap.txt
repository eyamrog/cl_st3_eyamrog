Pagano and Vasconcellos (2003) developed a map of Brazilian translation
studies based on data from the 1980s and 1990s, which
were compiled in a CD-ROM titled Estudos da Tradução no
Brasil (Translation Studies in Brazil) and released by the Anpoll
Translation Studies working group. The data contained in the CD-ROM
enabled the authors to identify translation studies conducted at the
master’s, doctoral, and post-doctoral levels in Brazilian universities and to
compare these studies with the branches outlined in Holmes’s map.
The resulting map produced by Pagano and Vasconcellos (2003) included
the branch of theater (intersemiotic translation), which was not present
in Holmes’s 1972–1988 map.
