To our knowledge, this study is the first to simultaneously
compare the time course of in vitro plant development from
distinct propagules. This approach enabled the observation that the developmental
process leading to NS plant formation may influence cellular energy
demand and, consequently, respiration activity differently compared to seedlings. However,
both seeds and NS plants of A. strobilacea are capable
of producing viable plants with leaves and roots within a
short period, thereby expanding the potential applications of in vitro
culture for both conservation and commercial production of this species.
The use of seeds promotes genetic variability, which is advantageous
for germplasm conservation (Pence 2010), whereas shoot multiplication in NS
facilitates large-scale clonal propagation, which is valuable for commercial production
targeting the ornamental plant market (Kyte et al. 2013).
