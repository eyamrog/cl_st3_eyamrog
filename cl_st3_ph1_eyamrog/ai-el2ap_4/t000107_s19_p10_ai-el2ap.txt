The subsequent step involved comparing the results obtained from the
searches conducted on the three websites. This comparison enabled the
identification of the specific website(s) from which each thesis and
dissertation was or was not retrieved. Notably, none of the
theses and dissertations identified were catalogued across all three websites
(see Figure 7). To confirm this observation, an additional search
was performed using the exact titles of the theses and
dissertations instead of relying on keywords and filters.
