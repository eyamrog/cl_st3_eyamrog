Despite their relatively low toxicity, benzodiazepines are associated with adverse
reactions such as exanthema, nausea, and headache. They can also
enhance the effects of ethanol and induce paradoxical reactions (Pinheiro
et al., 2014). Additional adverse effects include drowsiness, mental confusion,
anterograde amnesia, reduced motor coordination, and psychomotor impairment (Fajemiroye et
al., 2016; Farah et al., 2019; da Cunha et al.,
2021). The occurrence of these undesirable effects has prompted ongoing
research into alternative agents for minimal sedation in dental practice
(Ara√∫jo et al., 2018; Farah et al., 2019; da Cunha
et al., 2021).
