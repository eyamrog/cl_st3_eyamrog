The most accurate existing representation of this approach to Religious
Education (RE) is found in Community National Schools operated by
Education and Training Boards (ETBs). Their curriculum, Goodness Me, Goodness
You (GMGY), emphasizes a constructivist approach to learning and fosters
a critical perspective on RE through inter-religious dialogue, as outlined
in the ‘Beliefs and Religion’ strand. The curriculum encourages the
sharing of personal belief experiences, both religious and secular, to
facilitate children’s learning both about and from religion (Education and
Training Boards, 2016, p. 14). By addressing religious and non-religious
traditions in a pluralistic manner, the curriculum considers pupils’ background
knowledge and cultural contexts, and it explores a range of
spiritual concepts and perspectives through cooperative activities that involve parents
and faith communities.
