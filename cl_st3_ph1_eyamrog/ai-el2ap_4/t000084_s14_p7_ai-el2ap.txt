This section examines the relationship between participantsâ€™ age and gender
and their emoji usage, with the aim of determining whether
these demographic factors can help explain patterns in emoji use.
Statistical analyses were conducted to assess correlations and potential predictive
effects of age and gender on the frequency and types
of emojis used. The findings are discussed in relation to
existing literature on digital communication and demographic influences, providing insight
into how age and gender may contribute to variations in
emoji usage among participants.
