The visual depiction of the two fathers indicates distinct personalities
and caregiving roles: Daddy is shown smiling, while Dad is
portrayed with a more serious expression. Additionally, Dad’s blue shirt
is indicative of a traditionally masculine role. This association is
further emphasized on page 19, where Dad appears in a
pirate costume featuring the blue shirt, contrasting with Daddy’s pink
costume, which is suggestive of a more feminine role. As
previously noted, colour functions as a textual strategy that shapes
meaning; according to Painter et al. (2013, p. 35), colour
can be used cohesively as a visual device to connect
different elements within a narrative.
