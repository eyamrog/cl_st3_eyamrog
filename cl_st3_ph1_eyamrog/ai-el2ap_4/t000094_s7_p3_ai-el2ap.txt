This paper examines the relationship between written text and visual
elements in the picturebook Me, Daddy & Dad (2017), authored
by Gemma Denham and published by Elizabeth Publications, which features
a two-father family. The primary objective is to analyze the
compositional metafunction in order to observe how textual meanings are
constructed. This study aims to enhance understanding of meaning-making processes
in picturebooks and to consider their role as influential ideological
tools capable of contributing to social and political discourse (Baguley
& Kerby, 2021, p. 2). The analysis focuses on how
the compositional metafunction informs childrenâ€™s socialization and the development of
their ideological perspectives. A multimodal approach is employed to investigate
the interplay between visual and written modes of communication. The
narrative centers on Emily, the protagonist, who recounts various activities
she engages in with her two fathers. By examining the
creation of compositional meanings in this picturebook, the study seeks
to contribute to the deconstruction of traditional family models.
