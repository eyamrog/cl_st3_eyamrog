The analysis of the "Regional Engagement" dimension, as presented in
Table 8, indicates that there are no "very strong" correlations
among its indicators. However, a "strong" correlation is observed between
the indicators "Bachelor graduates working in the region" and "Master
graduates working in the region," with a correlation coefficient of
0.7668. This result is expected, given the similarity between these
indicators, suggesting that institutions with a high number of graduates
employed in the region tend to exhibit this pattern at
both the bachelor and master levels. Apart from this pair,
only one "moderate" correlation is identified, indicating that the majority
of indicators within this dimension are largely independent of each
other. The average magnitude of the correlations among all indicators
in this dimension is 0.2483, with a standard deviation of
0.2001. These findings support the validity of the "Regional Engagement"
dimension for the group of institutions analyzed in this study.
