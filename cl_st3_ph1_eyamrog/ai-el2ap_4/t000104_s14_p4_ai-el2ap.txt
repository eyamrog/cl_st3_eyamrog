The PEIt contains several trails that serve purposes such as
visitation, monitoring, and circulation, including the trail that provides access
to the Cachoeira do Paraíso waterfall (Figure 1), as previously
described (SMA, 2009; Magini and Abessa, 2017). The waterfall is
situated between the Itatins Mountain Ridge and the coastal plain
at an altitude of 35 meters. It does not feature
a vertical drop but rather a 17-meter step, referred to
as the Paraíso toboggan. The access trail is relatively well-preserved;
however, the presence of trails and visitor activity can result
in environmental impacts, including habitat fragmentation, erosion, sedimentation, soil compaction,
and soil and water pollution (SMA, 2009).
