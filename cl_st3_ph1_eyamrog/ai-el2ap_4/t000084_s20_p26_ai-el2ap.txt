The analysis of the data indicates that female participants' use
of emojis influenced the frequency of interactions during the course.
As illustrated in Figure 5, these participants contributed a higher
number of emojis associated with affection, such as the Face
Throwing a Kiss, Smiling Face With Heart-Eyes, Red Heart, and
Cherry Blossom emojis. Furthermore, Figure 5 demonstrates that the elevated
frequency of the eight most commonly used emojis was primarily
attributable to the contributions of female participants.
