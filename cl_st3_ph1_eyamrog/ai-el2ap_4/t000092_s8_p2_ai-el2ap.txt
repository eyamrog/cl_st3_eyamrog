In the early stages of the pandemic, reports of atypical
symptoms for this type of virus, specifically anosmia and dysgeusia,
became increasingly frequent. Although the precise mechanisms underlying these symptoms
remain unclear, it has been hypothesized that they may result
from neurological involvement. Additionally, several reports have described potential alterations
of the autonomic nervous system, presenting with manifestations such as
postural tachycardia syndrome with dysautonomia (POTS), orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, and
syncope.
