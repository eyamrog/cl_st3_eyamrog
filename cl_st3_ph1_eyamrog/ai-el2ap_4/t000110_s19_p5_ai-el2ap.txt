The species was described by Almeida et al. (2015) based
on specimens collected from the Cachoeira da Graça Reservoir in
São Paulo state. According to these authors, Staurosirella acidophila is
morphologically similar to Staurosirella confusa E.A. Morales (2005: 54–58), but
can be distinguished by differences in the arrangement and density
of the striae, which are approximately 11 in 10 µm.
Additionally, S. acidophila differs from Staurosirella oldenburgiana (Hustedt) E.A. Morales
(2005: 118) in the width of the valve center and
the presence of small areolae. In the present study, this
species was recorded in 52% of the core samples, with
a maximum relative abundance of 4%.
