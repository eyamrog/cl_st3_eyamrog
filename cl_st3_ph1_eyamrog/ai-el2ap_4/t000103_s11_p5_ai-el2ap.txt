Examples (1) and (2) illustrate pronominal anaphora, in which the
anaphor is a pronoun. In contrast, in Spanish and Portuguese,
it is not necessary to use a pronoun in the
subject position of the subordinate clause when the antecedent occupies
the subject position of the main clause. These languages are
classified as pro-drop or null subject languages (Chomsky, 1981; Rizzi,
1982). They permit null or zero anaphora when the antecedent
can be inferred either grammatically or pragmatically, as demonstrated in
example (3).
