This study examines the statistical correlations among all Dimensions to
determine whether institutions exhibit homogeneous performance across different Dimensions or
demonstrate a greater focus on specific ones. For instance, the
analysis assesses whether institutions that perform well in "Teaching and
Learning" also achieve high performance in "Research" or other Dimensions.
Investigating these correlations is particularly relevant because the traditional evaluation
conducted by CAPES primarily emphasizes the "Research" Dimension; therefore, understanding
how this Dimension relates to others in multidimensional rankings provides
valuable insights into institutional performance profiles.
