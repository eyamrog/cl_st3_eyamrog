By rejecting the ability of rational agents to assess the
truth claims of religious propositions, Erricker introduces a significant degree
of pragmatism into his theoretical framework. In this approach, the
question of truth is removed from the educational process, which
diminishes religionâ€™s potential to foster a collective sense of justice
and solidarity through shared ethical understandings. As a result, moral
inquiry loses its transcendental dimension, and the critical function of
normative discourse is replaced by a form of utilitarian particularism
in which individual preferences determine validity based on personal objectives.
At the communal level, political compromises are employed to manage
conflicts of interest, but these are pursued without reference to
any overarching normative resolution.
