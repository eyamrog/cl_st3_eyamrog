The father figure appears alongside Emily in several illustrations. On
page 11, it is Daddy who interacts directly with Emily,
as she sprays him with a hose. In addition to
observing Emily while she paints, Daddy is depicted watching her
serve tea on page 15 and while she is on
the swing on page 17. On page 20, Daddy is
positioned behind Emily in the stream, suggesting a protective stance.
On page 23, both fathers are shown running with Emily,
with Daddy behind her and Dad running after Max, the
dog. However, on page 24, there is a notable shift:
Dad is depicted on the right, attempting to catch Emily,
while Daddy observes. In this illustration, the dog is placed
in the foreground.
