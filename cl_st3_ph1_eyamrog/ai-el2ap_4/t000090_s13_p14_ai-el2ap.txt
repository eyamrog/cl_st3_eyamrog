To further examine this issue, Figure 3 presents the results
of the three approaches for generating general classifications. The horizontal
axis represents the ranking position assigned by “U-Multirank” based solely
on the number of “A” scores. The vertical axis displays
three sets of data points: the institutional ranking position according
to “U-Multirank” (blue dots), the ranking position based on the
average of indicators (red dots), and the ranking position based
on the average of dimensions (green dots). The analysis includes
1,070 European academic institutions listed in the 2020 edition of
“U-Multirank.” European institutions were selected due to the greater completeness
of their databases compared to those from other continents.
