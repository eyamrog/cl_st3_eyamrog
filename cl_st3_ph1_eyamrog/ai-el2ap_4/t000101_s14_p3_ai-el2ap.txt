Of the 337 survey respondents, 240 are career civil servants.
Approximately half of these individuals are employed in two federal
career tracks: Specialist in Public Policy and Government Management (EPPG)
and Technical Analyst of Social Policy (ATPS). The high representation
of respondents from these two career paths may contribute to
the observed tendency toward exit, as discussed later in the
article, since both positions—particularly the EPPG—facilitate mobility between federal institutions.
