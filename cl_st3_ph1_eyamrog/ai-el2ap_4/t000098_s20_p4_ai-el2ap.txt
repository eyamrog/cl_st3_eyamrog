A synthesis of the data presented in these two tables
indicates three distinct patterns of Covid-19 mortality that correspond with
specific geographic regions. In European countries and the United States,
overall mortality rates are high, and there is a pronounced
disparity in mortality rates between different age groups. In contrast,
Latin American countries and South Africa also exhibit high overall
mortality rates, but the differences in mortality across age groups
are less marked. In lower-income Asian countries, overall mortality rates
are substantially lower, and the association between age and mortality
is less evident. Some countries, such as Turkey, display intermediate
characteristics, while national-specific factors, as observed in Canada and Germany,
also contribute to variations in mortality patterns.
