Additional studies associated with this project will be conducted to
further examine the health conditions of the population under study,
with particular attention to factors such as social isolation and
the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the resulting
socioeconomic impacts. In addition to estimating the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2
infection, the findings of this study facilitate a better understanding
of the patterns and determinants of illness within the population.
These insights may contribute to the enhancement of health care
delivery in both the Unified Health System and the private
sector.
