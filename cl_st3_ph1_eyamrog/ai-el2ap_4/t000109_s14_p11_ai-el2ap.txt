The infectivity submodel adjusts the behavior of Ha based on
its epidemiological compartment. When Ha is in the Susceptible compartment,
it engages in daily activities and movements as specified by
its attributes and defined by the Mobility submodel. If Ha
transitions to any compartment other than Susceptible or Exposed, it
ceases movement, reflecting the assumption that it remains at home
to prevent transmission of the disease to other Ha. At
this point, all household members are classified in the Exposed
compartment.
