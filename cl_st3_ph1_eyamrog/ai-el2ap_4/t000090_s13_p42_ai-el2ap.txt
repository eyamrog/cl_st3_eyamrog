The results indicate that there is only one "very strong"
correlation, specifically between the indicators "Citation Rate" and "Top Cited
Publications," with a correlation coefficient of 0.9402. This value suggests
an almost perfect positive relationship, implying that institutions with higher
citation rates also tend to have a greater number of
highly cited publications. While this association is expected, the magnitude
of the correlation coefficient suggests that the rankings produced by
these two indicators are nearly identical, indicating a high degree
of redundancy between them.
