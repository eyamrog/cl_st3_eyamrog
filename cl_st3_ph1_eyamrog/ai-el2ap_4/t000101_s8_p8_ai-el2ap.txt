The assumption that policy change is invariably necessary in developing
countries has been challenged in contexts where far-right governments have
actively promoted the reversal of previously established progressive policies. This
trend is not limited to developing countries; it has also
been observed in various national contexts, including immigration policy in
the United States under the Trump administration, criminal and drug
policy in the Philippines under President Duterte, and environmental, social,
human rights, and education policies in Brazil under President Bolsonaro.
