The high-frequency (HF) component, which primarily reflects parasympathetic activity, and
the low-frequency (LF) component, which reflects both sympathetic and parasympathetic
activity, can be quantified through frequency domain analysis. The ratio
of LF to HF (LF/HF ratio) is commonly used to
represent sympathovagal balance.
