Diatoms are frequently utilized among biological groups preserved in sediments
due to their clear taxonomic characteristics, high abundance, good preservation
potential, and rapid response to environmental changes (Reid 2005; Bennion
& Simpson 2011). However, the use of diatoms as indicators
of environmental change necessitates a high level of taxonomic accuracy
(Birks 1994), as misidentifications can affect the interpretation and reliability
of data concerning contemporary diatom biodiversity (Buczko & Magyari 2007;
Wetzel & Ector 2014).
