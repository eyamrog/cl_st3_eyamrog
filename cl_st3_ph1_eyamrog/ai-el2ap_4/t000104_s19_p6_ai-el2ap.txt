Biological indices were calculated according to CETESB (2019) and indicated
the presence of sensitive organisms with the highest score (5),
such as Trichoptera (with case) and Plecoptera (see Table 5).
Tolerant organisms with a score of 1, including Diptera, Nematoda,
Hirudinea, Turbellaria, Polychaeta, and Oligochaeta, were also identified, as shown
in Table 4. The ecological index for each replicate and
sampling site was determined by summing the scores assigned to
the organisms found at each location. Most replicates were classified
as having excellent or good water quality, while only two
replicates (P2A and P3B) were classified as regular quality. When
replicates were grouped by sampling site, all three locations were
classified as having excellent water quality according to the index.
