Given the developmental differences between seeds and non-seed (NS) propagules,
we hypothesize that these propagules of A. strobilacea exhibit distinct
respiration rates during early plant development. To test this hypothesis,
we examined the morphological development and monitored the progression of
respiratory rates during the first 35 days of in vitro
shoot formation from both seeds and NS by measuring CO2
and O2 concentrations within culture vessels. Assessing the temporal changes
in respiratory rates during in vitro plant formation also enables
the detection of differences in photosynthetic activity between the two
types of propagules. The results obtained may reflect the metabolic
status of plants derived from seeds and NS, and provide
information on the timing of photosynthetic activity initiation, which is
associated with an increased capacity to withstand acclimatization (Ševčíková et
al. 2019). Consequently, this study may contribute to the optimization
of germplasm conservation and plant production protocols for A. strobilacea,
while also introducing a novel approach for the simultaneous assessment
of the early developmental dynamics of different explant types during
micropropagation.
