Data are presented for frequency-domain measures of heart rate variability
(HRV), including low-frequency power (LF) and high-frequency power (HF), reported
in both msÂ² and normalized units, as well as the
ratio of LF to HF power (LF:HF). The normalized spectral
indices are defined as follows: LF normalized units (LFnu) =
LF / (LF + HF) and HF normalized units (HFnu)
= HF / (LF + HF).
