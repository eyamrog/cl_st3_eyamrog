Conservation status – According to IUCN (2019) criteria B2a and
D, we propose that this species be classified as ‘Critically
Endangered’ (CR), as it is currently known from only a
single population within a restricted area, despite its occurrence within
a protected area (Minas Gerais 2018). This classification is further
supported by ongoing threats in the region, including afforestation with
Pinus and Eucalyptus, real estate development, unregulated visitation, illegal plant
collection, and grazing. Although the recent designation of the area
as a conservation unit may help mitigate these threats, additional
field studies are necessary to determine the species’ population size,
distribution patterns, and specific threats, as it has so far
been recorded only within the boundaries of Parque Estadual da
Serra Negra da Mantiqueira.
