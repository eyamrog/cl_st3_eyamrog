This research aims to advance the literature on policy dismantling
within the context of illiberal populism. The case of Brazil
under President Jair Bolsonaro demonstrates that policy dismantling can extend
beyond the typical forms of policy change associated with democratic
processes. Specifically, Brazil exhibits characteristics of authoritarian policy dismantling, characterized
by widespread intimidation of federal employees, institutional weakening, and decision-making
paralysis. As a result, a significant number of civil servants
choose to leave their positions, their agencies, the federal government,
or even the country. The departure of experienced personnel, particularly
those involved in the implementation of essential policies, further accelerates
the process of policy dismantling.
