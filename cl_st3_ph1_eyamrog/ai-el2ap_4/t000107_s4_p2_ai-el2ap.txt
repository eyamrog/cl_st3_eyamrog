The present study demonstrates a lack of standardization in the
cataloguing of academic studies by higher education institutions on their
websites, despite the existence of CAPES administrative regulation 13/2006. This
research provides two significant contributions to the field of translation
studies: first, it offers a comprehensive mapping of theses and
dissertations produced in Brazil; second, it identifies the need for
standardization and regular updating of the websites that host Brazilian
scholarly works. Addressing this issue may require a revision of
CAPES administrative regulation 13/2006, which could facilitate future mapping studies
and bibliographic reviews across various academic disciplines.
