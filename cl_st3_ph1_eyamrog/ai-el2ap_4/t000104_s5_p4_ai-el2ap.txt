Diptera (with head) were the most abundant taxonomic group sampled,
with a total of 80 individuals collected. First-order opportunistic organisms
exhibit high tolerance to contaminants, fluctuations in physicochemical parameters, and
climatic variations. Taxonomic groups such as Diptera, Nematoda, Hirudinea, Turbellaria,
Polychaeta, and Oligochaeta are representative of this category. Additionally, the
distribution of some of these groups is influenced by substrate
type and water flow within the environment (Poe & Stefan,
1974; Gorni & Alves, 2012). These freshwater organisms typically inhabit
areas near the sediment surface and play a significant role
in the decomposition of organic matter. For instance, Oligochaeta contribute
to water purification and function as primary consumers or decomposers
(Uzunov et al., 1988; Abebe et al., 2006). Other representatives,
such as Turbellaria and Hirudinea, exhibit low dispersal capacity and
may be characteristic of the specific environment studied (Knakievicz, 2014;
Metcalfe et al., 1984).
