Rivers are watercourses that flow from regions of higher elevation
to areas of lower elevation, with their mouths typically discharging
into seas, lakes, or larger rivers. The water in rivers
originates from various sources, including melting glaciers, precipitation, and groundwater
(Dunn, 1989). The unidirectional flow of river water supports the
formation of diverse habitats, which in turn sustain a variety
of aquatic and terrestrial species (Buss, 2008). Rivers perform multiple
ecological functions, such as regulating erosion and deposition processes, transporting
sediments, and maintaining the hydrological cycle, among others (ANA, 2008).
Additionally, rivers are essential for human survival, as they provide
a range of critical ecosystem services.
