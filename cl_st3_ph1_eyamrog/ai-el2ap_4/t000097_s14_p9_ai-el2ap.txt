Physical activity is defined as any bodily movement produced by
skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure. According to Krebs, Berling-Ernst,
and Halle, physical activity serves as a therapeutic option and
supportive measure for cancer patients. Several studies have examined the
role of physical activity and exercise during both the treatment
and post-treatment phases of cancer, particularly breast cancer, and recommend
a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per
week.
