To categorize buildings as residential, commercial, recreational, or other types,
city grid maps provided by the Paraná Municipality Land Registry
Office were utilized. Additional data sources included Google Maps and
Google Places®, which facilitated the initial mapping of various city
areas under investigation. Subsequently, an on-site visual inspection of the
plots and their corresponding labels was conducted to verify the
accuracy of the information obtained from these resources. GPS-based tracking
tools were employed to support the field survey, enabling the
completion of the GIS map. During the system initialization routine,
each hectare (Ha) was assigned attributes associated with this submodel,
thereby populating the entire map with the number of human
agents corresponding to each plot of land.
