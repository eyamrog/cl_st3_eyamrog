São Paulo has a higher number of hospital beds per
inhabitant and greater primary health care coverage than Rio de
Janeiro in 2020 (62.9% and 58.9%, respectively)5; however, these differences
alone are insufficient to account for the observed discrepancy in
the number of hospitalized Covid-19 patients. The comparatively greater disorganization
of the health system in Rio de Janeiro is a
persistent issue. For example, in July 2019, the Regional Labor
Court of the 1st Region in Rio de Janeiro ordered
the seizure of R$ 38 million from the accounts of
the municipality to compensate 1,500 health agents dismissed by the
Institute of Basic and Advanced Health Care (Iabas, Instituto de
Atenção Básica e Avançada à Saúde)6. This institution was also
implicated in the mismanagement of field hospitals during the pandemic,
and documented cases of corruption within the Rio de Janeiro
health department led to the arrest of the state health
secretary.
