As bureaucrats are either reassigned or choose to leave their
positions, the conditions that facilitate policy dismantling become more pronounced.
As noted by interviewee 47 at the Ministry of Education,
this process can result in a lack of personnel with
the necessary knowledge and institutional memory to maintain the policy,
including understanding its mechanisms, instruments, and relevant stakeholders. Consequently, the
capacity to operate the policy is significantly diminished, which in
turn accelerates further policy dismantling, as illustrated below.
