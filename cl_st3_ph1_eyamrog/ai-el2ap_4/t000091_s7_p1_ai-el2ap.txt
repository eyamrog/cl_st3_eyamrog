Anxiety is a significant factor contributing to patient stress in
dental settings, with prevalence rates ranging from 10% to 60%
of the population (Deogade & Suresan, 2016). Despite advancements in
technology, scientific knowledge, and pain control techniques, dental treatment continues
to elicit fear, with the intensity varying among individuals (Dantas
et al., 2016; Facco & Zanette, 2017; da Cunha et
al., 2021). Invasive procedures, such as the administration of anesthesia,
are particularly associated with increased levels of fear and anxiety.
Furthermore, these emotional responses may be influenced by cultural background,
previous experiences, and gender (Vanhee et al., 2020). As a
result, even patients who are generally calm may experience heightened
anxiety prior to dental treatment sessions (Ara√∫jo et al., 2018;
Farah et al., 2019; da Cunha et al., 2021).
