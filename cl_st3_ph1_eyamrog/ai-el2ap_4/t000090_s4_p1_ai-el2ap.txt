This paper examines the academic international multidimensional ranking system "U-Multirank,"
which comprises five dimensions and 36 indicators. U-Multirank was previously
analyzed by CAPES during the development of a new evaluation
framework for postgraduate programs in Brazil (CAPES, 2019). Given this
prior consideration, further investigation of U-Multirank using existing data is
warranted to assess the potential outcomes and implications of its
application within the Brazilian context.
