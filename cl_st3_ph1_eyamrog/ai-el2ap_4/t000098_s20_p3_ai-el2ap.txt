Although the exponential increase in mortality rates with age is
observed across all countries, this relationship is less pronounced in
developing countries compared to developed countries in Europe and North
America. In developed countries, Covid-19 mortality among individuals aged 80
years or older is 5,000 to 10,000 times higher than
among those under 20 years of age. This finding is
consistent with the conclusions of Cohen et al. (2021), who
analyzed the distribution of deaths in Western Europe as early
as April 2020. In contrast, the difference in mortality rates
between these age groups is smaller in Latin American countries,
reaching approximately 500 times in Peru and Brazil. The primary
factor underlying this divergence is the higher mortality observed among
younger age groups in poorer countries; however, in some high-income
countries, exceptionally high mortality rates among the elderly are also
observed. The highest mortality rate reported in Table 1 pertains
to individuals aged 80 years or older in England and
Wales, where one in 51 people in this age group
died from Covid-19 between the onset of the pandemic and
January 28, 2021. In Mexico, which was also severely affected
by the pandemic, the corresponding figure is one death per
108 individuals in this age group. Overall, the data in
the last column of Table 1 indicate that the variation
in mortality rates among countries is lower in older age
groups, which contrasts with the findings of Oâ€™Driscoll et al.
(2021: 141), who, using a different methodology, reported otherwise.
