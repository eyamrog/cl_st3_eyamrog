Dad is depicted in various ways throughout the text: he
appears on the right side of the page on pages
7, 8, and 15, and is most frequently shown engaging
in activities with Emily, such as drawing (page 8), cooking
(page 12), and pushing Emily on the swing (page 16).
In contrast, Daddy is primarily positioned on the left side
of the page on pages 7, 8, and 15, and
is mainly portrayed as an observer of the actions performed
by Emily and Dad on pages 17 and 24. Exceptions
to these patterns occur on page 19, where Daddy is
centrally located; on page 20, where he is shown fishing
with Emily; and on pages 23, 27, and 28, where
he appears on the right side next to Dad. These
visual arrangements suggest that Dad assumes a more active role
in Emily’s life and within the family context. Notably, on
page 19, Daddy is centrally positioned and depicted wearing a
pink dress, which may be interpreted as associating him with
traditionally feminine characteristics. Additionally, the use of pink for Emily’s
tea set, as well as the net and bucket she
uses for fishing, reinforces her identification as a girl, given
the conventional association of pink with femininity. However, other items
in Emily’s room, such as the lamp, bed cover, and
her pyjamas, are purple, a colour that is traditionally linked
to feminism.
