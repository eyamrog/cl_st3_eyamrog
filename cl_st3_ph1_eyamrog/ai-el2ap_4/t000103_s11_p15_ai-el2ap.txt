Carminatiâ€™s (2002) Position of Antecedent Strategy (PAS) posits that the
interpretation of anaphors in Italian sentences with intrasentential anaphora is
determined by the syntactic function of their antecedents. Specifically, null
pronouns in subject position typically refer to the subject of
the main clause, whereas unstressed overt pronouns in subject position
generally refer to the complement of the main clause. However,
it remains uncertain whether this theoretical framework extends to account
for the distinctions between unstressed and stressed pronouns in non-null
subject languages such as English.
