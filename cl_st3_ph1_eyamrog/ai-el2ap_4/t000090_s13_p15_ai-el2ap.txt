The differences in institutional rankings across the classification methods are
substantial. Statistical correlations were calculated for each pair of classification
approaches, yielding the following results: “U-Multirank” versus the average of
Indicators, 0.8035; “U-Multirank” versus the average of Dimensions, 0.6179; and
the average of Indicators versus the average of Dimensions, 0.8403.
These results indicate that the highest similarity is observed between
the averages of Indicators and Dimensions, whereas the “U-Multirank” methodology
produces less correlated outcomes, particularly when compared to the average
of Dimensions. Based on these findings, the use of the
average of Dimensions appears to be the most appropriate method
for generating a general classification, and it is therefore employed
in this study to identify the top 300 performing institutions
in Europe in 2020. The impact of missing or “Not
Applicable” data is present in all classification methods. In the
“U-Multirank” classification, missing data do not contribute to an “A”
grade, while in the average of Indicators and average of
Dimensions classifications, missing data are treated as zero. This approach
may have a greater effect on the latter two classifications;
however, this study considers it justified to penalize institutions that
did not submit data, as this is the sole reason
for missing values. “Not Applicable” data occur much less frequently
and do not significantly influence the statistical conclusions presented in
this study.
