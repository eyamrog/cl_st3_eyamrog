The Position of Antecedent Strategy was not supported by data
from either Spanish or English native speakers. Both groups demonstrated

Spanish native speakers exhibited a stronger preference for establishing this
correspondence in instances of zero anaphora compared to cases involving
pronominal anaphora.
