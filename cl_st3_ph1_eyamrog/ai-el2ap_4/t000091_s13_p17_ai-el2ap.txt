In the study by Farah et al. (2019), 20 anxious
patients requiring bilateral extraction of lower third molars were selected
to undergo surgery and participate in the research. On the
day of the procedure, patients received either 100 mg of
valerian or 15 mg of midazolam orally, 60 minutes prior
to surgery, in a randomized crossover, split-mouth design. The study
found no significant changes in physiological parameters measured at specific
time points during the surgery. Postoperatively, patients completed a self-assessment
questionnaire regarding their anxiety levels. The results indicated that none
of the patients who received valerian reported anterograde amnesia, whereas
40% of those who received midazolam experienced this effect. Additionally,
55% of patients expressed a preference for the surgery in
which valerian was administered compared to midazolam. These findings suggest
that valerian may provide adequate comfort and relaxation for patients
without inducing sedation or drowsiness to the extent observed with
midazolam.
