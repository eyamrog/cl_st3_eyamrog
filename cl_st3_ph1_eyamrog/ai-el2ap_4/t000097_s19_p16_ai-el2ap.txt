The interventions were conducted by a range of professionals, including
Physical Education specialists or individuals working in the field of
physical exercise, as reported in several studies. Other studies involved
physiologists, physiotherapists, or a combination of Physical Education professionals and
physiotherapists. In some cases, the interventions were administered by clinical
staff comprising doctors, physiotherapists, Physical Education professionals, and nurses. Additional
studies reported the involvement of therapists or specialists in eurythmy,
or the researcher themselves, with one study indicating that a
single professional was responsible for each application. One article did
not specify the professional background of those administering the intervention.
