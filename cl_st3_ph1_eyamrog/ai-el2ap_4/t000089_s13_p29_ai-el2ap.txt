Clive Erricker’s conception of religious education (RE) provides a useful
framework for evaluating pragmatist theories of multicultural education. Erricker (2007)
articulates his postmodern educational philosophy by drawing on Kierkegaard’s theology
of the absurd and Derrida’s theory of language. Regarding Kierkegaard,
Erricker adopts the concept of God as the Unknown, understood
as an entity that exists beyond the limits of reason
and in a state of absolute difference, inaccessible to conceptual
understanding. Erricker argues that Kierkegaard’s characterization of faith as absurdity
highlights the limitations of rational attempts to define the nature
of God through metaphysical reasoning. Furthermore, this perspective encourages individuals
to recognize religiosity as a performative attitude, involving actions directed
toward engaging with the unknown, which necessitates interpretation and, crucially,
decision-making in processes of meaning-making. Thus, the individual is required
to make a conscious choice regarding their beliefs.
