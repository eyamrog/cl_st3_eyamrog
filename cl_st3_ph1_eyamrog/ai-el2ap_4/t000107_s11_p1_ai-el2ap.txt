Bibliometrics encompasses the monitoring of knowledge domains by mapping new
discoveries, research areas, and existing knowledge gaps. In Brazil, metric
studies related to information, including bibliometrics, have been conducted since
the 1970s (Machado, 2007). Initially, these studies aimed to facilitate
the cataloguing of documents and information in order to provide
an overview of the country's scientific output. Over time, the
term "bibliometrics" gained wider recognition, and the bibliometric method became
established as an indicator of the development of academic and
technological research in Brazil (Machado, 2007).
