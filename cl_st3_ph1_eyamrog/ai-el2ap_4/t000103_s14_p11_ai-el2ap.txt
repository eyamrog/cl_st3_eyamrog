Half of the sentences contained anaphora, while the other half
contained cataphora. Within each group, half of the sentences included
a salient anaphor (represented by an unstressed pronoun in Portuguese
or Spanish, or a stressed pronoun in English), and the
other half included a non-salient anaphor (represented by ellipsis in
Portuguese or Spanish, or an unstressed pronoun in English). Participants
were instructed to interpret pronouns written in capital letters as
stressed. Sentence (9) above provides an example of stressed pronominal
anaphora, whereas sentence (10) below illustrates unstressed pronominal cataphora in
English.
