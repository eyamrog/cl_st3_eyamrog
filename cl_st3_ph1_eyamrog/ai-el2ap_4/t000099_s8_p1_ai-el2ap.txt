The establishment of in vitro germplasm banks is an effective
conservation strategy for endangered plant species, as it enables the
storage of a large number of specimens in limited space
and requires less maintenance compared to field or greenhouse cultivation
(Imarhiagbe et al. 2016, Oseni et al. 2018). This approach
can be applied to both seeds and tissue explants, such
as nodal segments (NS) (Pilatti et al. 2011). The ornamental
bromeliad Acanthostachys strobilacea (Schult. & Schult.f.) Klotzsch (Bromeliaceae) can be
propagated in vitro using seeds or NS isolated from the
stems of elongated plants, which are subsequently subcultured to generate
new individuals (Santos et al. 2010). Micropropagation has been widely
employed for the cultivation of various bromeliad species to supply
the ornamental plant market and to reduce illegal collection from
natural habitats (Mercier & Nievola 2003, Negrelle et al. 2012).
The ability to maintain cultures under controlled environmental conditions, including
light, temperature, and nutrient availability, has also facilitated research on
basic physiological processes in a range of species (Narayani &
Srivastava 2017, Bakhshipour et al. 2019, Chetty et al. 2020),
including several studies focused on bromeliads (Carvalho et al. 2013,
Freitas et al. 2015, Andrade & Tamaki 2016, Santos et
al. 2017, Silva et al. 2017, Andrade-Santos et al. 2020,
Silva et al. 2020).
