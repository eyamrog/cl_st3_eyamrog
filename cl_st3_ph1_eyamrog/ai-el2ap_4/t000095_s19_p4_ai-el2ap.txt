For all age groups, the overall adjusted odds ratios are
presented in Table 3. The age- and sex-adjusted analyses demonstrate
a pattern consistent with that observed in the crude rates.
After further adjustment for all reported comorbidities, the odds ratio
comparing Rio de Janeiro to São Paulo was 2.51 in
private hospitals and 2.29 in public hospitals. In the capital
cities, the disparity is more pronounced, with Rio de Janeiro
exhibiting approximately three times the risk of São Paulo; the
odds ratios were 2.74 for public hospitals and 3.46 for
private hospitals. Additionally, in both Rio de Janeiro and São
Paulo, mortality rates in public hospitals are approximately twice as
high as those in private hospitals (Table 4).
