During the interview process, several participants exhibited emotional responses when
discussing either their current circumstances or their past work experiences.
In response, the research team introduced an additional question at
the conclusion of the interview, inviting participants to consider future
possibilities and identify a project they would be interested in
pursuing. This modification aimed to conclude the interview with a
focus on positive and forward-looking topics, thereby mitigating any negative
psychological impact observed during the interviews.
