As shown in Figure 1, the study population comprised 164
adolescents with a mean age of 16.8 years (SD =
1.07; range: 15–19 years). Of the participants, 53.7% were male
and 46.3% were female. In the year preceding the event,
28.7% (n = 47) had previously contracted COVID-19 and had
fully recovered prior to participation; none of these individuals developed
COVID-19 during the event. Among attendees, 43% (n = 70)
were vaccinated, while 57% (n = 94) were unvaccinated. A
total of 98.8% of participants underwent an antigen test within
24 hours before the event. The two individuals who did
not complete pre-event testing were tested after the event and
both received negative results. The overall incidence of COVID-19 in
the study population was 25% (95% CI: 18.6–32.4; n =
41). Two individuals tested positive on the antigen rapid test
conducted 24 hours prior to the event; one was vaccinated
and reported wearing a face mask for most of the
event, while the other was unvaccinated and did not consistently
use a face mask. The remaining 98.4% had negative antigen
test results prior to the event. The majority of participants
(87.8%) either removed their face masks upon entering the event
or did not use them at all. Most participants (86.4%)
remained at the event for two or more hours, and
82.9% spent the majority of their time indoors. High-volume music
was continuously played in the non-ventilated indoor area, which may
have increased the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission due to elevated
vocal effort and associated aerosol emissions (Kopechek, 2020).
