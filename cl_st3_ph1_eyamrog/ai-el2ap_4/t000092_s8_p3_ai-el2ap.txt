In this context, it is probable that subclinical manifestations of
baroreflex involvement are present, given that the baroreflex mechanism accounts
for approximately 90% of short-term variability in blood pressure and
heart rate. Regulation of the baroreflex is mediated by the
autonomic nervous system through the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic
activity.
