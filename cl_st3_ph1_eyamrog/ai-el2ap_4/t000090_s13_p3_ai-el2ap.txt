The concept of multidimensional ranking was first introduced at a
conference in 2008 under the French Presidency of the European
Union (Van Vught and Ziegele, 2012), in response to the
recognized need for a new methodology to assess various dimensions
of quality in higher education institutions. This initiative led to
the development of "U-Multirank," which, as of its 2020 edition,
includes 1,759 universities from 92 countries, encompassing approximately 5,000 faculties
and more than 11,400 courses across 28 subject areas (https://www.umultirank.org/about/u-multirank/frequently-asked-questions/).
