A study assessed the efficacy of Valerian in managing anxiety
among patients undergoing bilateral extraction of impacted third molars. Participants
received either 100 mg of Valerian or a placebo orally,
administered as a single dose one hour before the surgical
procedure. The results indicated that Valerian exhibited an anxiolytic effect
and may be suitable for conscious sedation in adult patients
undergoing extraction of impacted mandibular third molars. Additionally, the study
found that Valerian did not induce anterograde amnesia, as patients
were able to recall all events related to the surgical
procedure (Pinheiro et al., 2014).
