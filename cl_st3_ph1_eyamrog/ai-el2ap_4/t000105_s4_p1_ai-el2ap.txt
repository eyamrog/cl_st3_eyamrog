Despite the inherent limitations in the diagnostic efficacy of rapid
serological tests for detecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, their use was
effective in determining the seroprevalence of viral infections in the
cities studied. This enabled researchers to assess viral circulation and
estimate the proportion of individuals exposed to the virus, thereby
providing essential data to inform public health decision-making aimed at
reducing cases and mortality. Additionally, the findings of this study
contribute valuable information regarding the socio-economic and health impacts of
social distancing measures on the population.
