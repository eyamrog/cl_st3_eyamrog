The definition incorporates a relevant distinction among various types of
policy dismantling strategies, including active dismantling, dismantling by default, symbolic
dismantling, and dismantling by arena shifting. It also accounts for
the possibility that dismantling may occur through the manipulation of
policy implementation capacities. These components of the policy dismantling framework
are both analytically useful and applicable to the policy dismantling
processes currently observed in Brazil under the Bolsonaro administration, as
discussed below.
