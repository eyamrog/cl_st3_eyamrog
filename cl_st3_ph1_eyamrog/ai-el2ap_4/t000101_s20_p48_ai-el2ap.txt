The testimonies provided by several participants, as illustrated in the
quotes above, are consistent with the high number of harassment
cases reported by ARCA, the National Association of Public Careers
for Development. As of 22 July 2021, federal civil servants
had reported 867 cases of harassment within the Bolsonaro administration
to ARCAâ€™s online platform. This environment, which compels civil servants
to leave their positions, self-censor, and obscure their professional contributions,
represents not a routine policy change but a process of
policy dismantling characterized by authoritarian tendencies.
