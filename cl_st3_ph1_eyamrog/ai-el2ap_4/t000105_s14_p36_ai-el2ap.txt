According to the manufacturer's validation data, the One Step COVID-2019
Test (Wondfo®) demonstrated a sensitivity of 86.43% (95% CI: 82.58%–89.58%)
and a specificity of 99.57% (95% CI: 97.92%–99.92%). Negative results
do not definitively exclude SARS-CoV-2 infection, and positive results should
not be interpreted as conclusive evidence of current infection. Rather,
these results indicate prior exposure to the infectious agent [19].
