The species can be distinguished from Aulacoseira canadensis (Hustedt) Simonsen
(1979: 57) by the morphology of the ringleist, which is
notably solid and thick at the center of the column.
Additionally, it differs from Aulacoseira crassipunctata Krammer (Bahls et al.
2009) in the outline of the areolae, which are small
and rounded in the latter species. In the present study,
the species was observed in only 2% of the core
samples, with a maximum relative abundance of 6%. Its occurrence
was restricted to samples dated from the Late Holocene, approximately
2,200 calibrated years BP to approximately 320 calibrated years BP.
This study represents the first documented record of the species
in Brazil.
