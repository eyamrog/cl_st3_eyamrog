In examining each religion’s worldviews, rituals, and practices, the curriculum
requires students to develop an appreciation for each tradition by
identifying similarities and commonalities among them. Although the stated objective
is to promote critical thinking, the curriculum adopts a cautious
approach to divergent perspectives, operating on the assumption that there
are shared elements and values that connect different traditions. This
tendency is evident throughout the document’s articulation of the goals
for the ‘Belief Systems’ strand. For example, the first strand
unit, “Introducing Key Figures in the Major Belief Systems,” specifies
that students in fifth and sixth class should “identify any
common features which may exist between religious leaders, e.g. the
emergence of different Christian traditions, the problems that arose across
these traditions and the move towards closer integration” (Educate Together,
2004, p. 36). Similarly, the second strand unit, “Rites and
Ceremonies,” requires students to “discuss the similarities and differences across
the major belief systems in respect of ritual and ceremony
and identify any common links between these rites” (Educate Together,
2004, p. 37). This emphasis on identifying commonalities is also
present in the remaining strand units, “Celebrations” and “Beliefs and
Values,” where students are expected to find similarities among various
religious festivals (Educate Together, 2004, p. 38) and across different
codes and value systems (Educate Together, 2004, p. 39).
