Our findings indicating higher Covid-19 lethality among hospitalized patients in
Rio de Janeiro compared to São Paulo, both in the
capitals and interior regions of the states, are consistent with
mortality rates per 100,000 inhabitants reported by the Epidemiological Monitor
of the Ministry of Health. Additionally, a recent study utilizing
SIVEP-Gripe data from March 2020 to January 2021 reported that
age-standardized Covid-19 mortality in Rio de Janeiro was 56% higher
than in São Paulo. The authors of this study demonstrated
that SIVEP-Gripe is a reliable source for Covid-19 mortality data
and that age-specific mortality rates are consistently higher in Rio
de Janeiro across all age groups when compared to São
Paulo.
