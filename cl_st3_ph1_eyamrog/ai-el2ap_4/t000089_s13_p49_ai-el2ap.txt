The Hampshire, Portsmouth, Southampton, and Isle of Wight Agreed Syllabus,
which has also been adopted by the City of Westminster
Local Education Authority in London, places a strong emphasis on
conceptual enquiry in the study of religious and spiritual themes.
Its primary objective is to develop pupilsâ€™ evaluative skills by
encouraging the articulation of experiential knowledge. The syllabus outlines five
key steps that underpin religious education: (1) Communicate and Apply,
in which pupils use their own experiences to present and
discuss concepts such as community, celebration, and worship, progressing from
general understanding to specific examples within various religious traditions; (2)
Enquire and Contextualise, where pupils identify interpretative differences and begin
to formulate questions regarding meaning and significance; and (3) Evaluate,
which involves encouraging pupils to make informed judgements about the
relevance of these concepts to a meaningful life. The syllabus,
similar to others, promotes an empathetic approach to learning, encouraging
pupils to understand different traditions by considering perspectives other than
their own. Notably, in the Evaluate stage, the syllabus specifies
that pupils should be able to conduct two distinct forms
of assessment: one that evaluates concepts according to the standards
of the relevant religious tradition, and another that considers how
these concepts and experiences inform their own personal spiritual enquiry
(United Kingdom. Hampshire County Council et al., 2016).
