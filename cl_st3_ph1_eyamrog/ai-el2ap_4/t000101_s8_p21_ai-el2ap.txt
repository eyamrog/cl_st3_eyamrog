Sabourin et al. (2020) identify a phenomenon they term “bureaucratic
adaptation” (p. 62) in their analysis of the dismantling of
family farming policies in Brazil and Argentina. They argue that
both bureaucratic actors and civil society ultimately acquiesce to the
processes of policy dismantling. While this may represent the long-term
outcome, the present research indicates that such adaptation often conceals
a degree of covert resistance among civil servants, some of
whom have chosen to exit the bureaucracy as an individual
strategy to avoid complicity with dismantling efforts in an authoritarian
context. Consistent with the observations of Levitsky and Ziblatt (2018),
contemporary autocratic regimes tend not to emerge through overt coups
or revolutions, but rather through the gradual transformation and subversion
of institutions originally designed to uphold democratic governance.
