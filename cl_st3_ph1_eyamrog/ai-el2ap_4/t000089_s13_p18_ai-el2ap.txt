This paper argues that the pragmatist critique of objective knowledge
provides support for a tradition-oriented approach to religious education (RE),
in which practical knowledge is advanced through a curriculum that
incorporates local cultural practices and students’ experiences of religious phenomena.
It is posited that, as these practices constitute a network
of cooperative activities, Dewey’s philosophy enables the collective exploration of
conceptions of the good life that are shaped by cultural
perspectives. While the subsequent section will address a departure from
the non-metaphysical premises of pragmatist theories, the emphasis placed by
Dewey and Rorty on culture as the basis for moral
and intellectual inquiry aligns with the ethical-dialogical framework adopted in
this study of RE.
