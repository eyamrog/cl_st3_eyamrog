U-Multirank (https://www.umultirank.org/; PRADO 2021a, 2021b) was developed to assess the
performance of higher education institutions across five dimensions: (1) Teaching
and Learning, (2) Research, (3) Knowledge Transfer, (4) International Orientation,
and (5) Regional Engagement. Each dimension comprises between four and
eleven indicators, depending on the specific area being evaluated. The
platform is designed primarily for prospective students seeking an international
comparison of higher education institutions to identify those that best
align with their preferences. Users can examine each indicator individually
or in groups, allowing them to focus on the criteria
most relevant to their decision-making process.
