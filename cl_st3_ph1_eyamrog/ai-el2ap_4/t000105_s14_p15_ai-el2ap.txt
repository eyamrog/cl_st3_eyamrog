In the week preceding data collection, the research team enrolled
households within pre-selected census sectors and implemented strategies to increase
public awareness of the study. These strategies included distributing informational
brochures and posters in public locations and promoting the survey
through local radio stations, social media platforms (Instagram and Facebook),
university television, WhatsApp groups, and religious gatherings.
