One of the main findings of this study is the
limited number of theses and dissertations related to medical translation
in Brazil. Given the significant role that medical translation plays
in the advancement of scientific knowledge, it was anticipated that
this field would attract considerable academic interest and yield a
greater volume of research output. However, the results of our
searches indicate that the number of studies in this area
is substantially lower than expected.
