The possibility of exit may appear unlikely for public employees
with tenured positions. However, civil servants have access to a
range of exit strategies, some of which are subtle. These
include transferring to a different department or unit within the
same institution or agency, transferring to a different government agency
or relocating to another municipality, taking temporary leave to pursue
graduate studies, taking unpaid leave, or ultimately resigning from civil
service. While there is a common perception that public employees
remain in the same position throughout their careers, evidence from
the Brazilian federal administration indicates that federal careers offer varying
degrees of mobility, with some positions being more conducive to
movement than others.
