The integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and Learning
and Knowledge Technologies (LKT) in the classroom has significant potential
to enhance teaching and learning processes. These resources can facilitate
access to a wide range of educational materials, support diverse
learning styles, and promote student engagement through interactive and collaborative
activities. Furthermore, ICT and LKT can enable personalized learning experiences,
allowing educators to tailor instruction to individual student needs and
monitor progress more effectively. The use of these technologies also
fosters the development of digital literacy skills, which are increasingly
essential in contemporary society. Overall, the didactic usefulness of ICT
and LKT lies in their capacity to enrich educational environments,
improve instructional efficiency, and better prepare students for the demands
of the digital age.
