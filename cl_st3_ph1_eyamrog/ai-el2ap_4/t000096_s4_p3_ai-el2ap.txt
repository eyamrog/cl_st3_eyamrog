This type of study is currently highly valued, as the
global COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 onward necessitated a widespread shift
to technology-mediated education. This shift has underscored the ongoing need
for teachers to possess the knowledge required for the effective
use and integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) in
learning processes. In response, a postgraduate program has been developed
with a curriculum specifically designed for ICT-mediated learning. The proposed
curriculum includes areas of study that require holistic and integrative
analysis, such as digital literacy for contemporary society, teaching in
digital environments, the design and development of digital content and
resources for learning, innovative approaches to learning and educational innovation,
and research in educational technology. Furthermore, it is essential that
curricular proposals involving ICT integration in education incorporate flexible study
modules, allowing future cohorts to adapt curricular content to ongoing
innovations and emerging trends in educational technology.
