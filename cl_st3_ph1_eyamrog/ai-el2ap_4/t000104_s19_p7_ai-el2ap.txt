The cluster analysis indicated that the sampling sites exhibited similarities
of 50% or greater based on the taxonomic composition of
their respective replicates (Figure 2). Two primary groups were identified:
the first comprised all replicates from P2 and two replicates
from P3 (P3A and P3B), with further subdivision by sampling
site; the second group consisted of replicates from P1 and
P3C. These results suggest a higher degree of similarity between
the assemblages from P1 and P3. In contrast, the cluster
analysis based on species did not reveal distinct groupings, which
may be attributed to the high incidence of “double-zeros,” as
most taxa were present in only a few replicates, with
the exception of Diptera with head I and II, and
Diptera without head.
