Building on the framework established by Valenzuela et al. (2011),
this study compares the resolution of zero and pronominal forward
and backward anaphora in Spanish and Portuguese with the resolution
of non-emphatic and emphatic pronominal forward and backward anaphora in
English. Following initial pilot studies (Bruscato & Baptista, 2022a, 2022b),
the research has been extended to examine how both L1
and L2 speakers address ambiguity in anaphora resolution across these
languages.
