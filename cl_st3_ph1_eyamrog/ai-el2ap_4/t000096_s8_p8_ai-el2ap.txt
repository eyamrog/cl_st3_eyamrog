This study presents the curricular structure of a postgraduate program
at Universidad Nacional de Chimborazo (UNACH) in Ecuador, designed to
address the requirements of the macro, meso, and micro levels
of curricular concretion. The program demonstrates integration with research and
community engagement, which are fundamental functions of universities as contributors
to national economic and social development. For each level and
component of the curriculum, appropriate evaluation processes are implemented to
validate the effectiveness and quality of the postgraduate program. These
processes utilize a range of instruments and evidence to assess
the achievement of learning outcomes as defined in the master's
program.
