The valves are linear-lanceolate, hyaline, and possess rounded ends. The
axial area is wide and occupies the entire valve face.
Striae are not visible under light microscopy. This taxon is
morphologically similar to Rimoneis inanis M.Garcia (2010) in valve shape,
although it exhibits more pronounced and less rounded valve ends.
Additionally, Rimoneis sp. displays smaller valve dimensions (R. inanis: length
17–25 µm, width 2.7–3.3 µm). Currently, the genus Rimoneis comprises
only two described species worldwide, with R. inanis restricted to
freshwater and brackish environments on sandy beaches of the Lagoa
dos Patos lagoon and Guaíba River in southern Brazil. Rimoneis
sp. was recorded in 5% of the core samples, with
a maximum relative abundance of 4%. It is present in
samples dated to the Late Holocene, approximately 3,750 to 1,450
calibrated years before present.
