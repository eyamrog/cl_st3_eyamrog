In this equation, X and Y represent the values of
the two variables under investigation, and n denotes the number
of paired data points. The resulting correlation coefficient ranges from
-1 to 1. A value of -1 indicates a perfect
negative linear correlation, where an increase in one variable corresponds
to a proportional decrease in the other. Conversely, a value
of 1 indicates a perfect positive linear correlation, where both
variables increase proportionally. A value of zero signifies no linear
relationship between the variables, indicating statistical independence. Intermediate values reflect
varying degrees of linear association, either positive or negative. For
the purposes of this study, the following interpretation of correlation
coefficients is applied: -0.19 to 0.19 indicates a very weak
correlation; -0.20 to 0.39, a weak correlation; -0.40 to 0.69,
a moderate correlation; -0.70 to 0.89, a strong correlation; and
-0.90 to 1.00, a very strong correlation. The initial results
are presented in Table 3, which displays the correlations among
the five Dimensions of the U-Multirank for the “Top-300 performers”
in Europe in 2020.
