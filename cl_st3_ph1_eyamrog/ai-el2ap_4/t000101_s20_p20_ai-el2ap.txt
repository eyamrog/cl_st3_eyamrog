When a democratic pluralist leader assumes office, changes in high-level
cabinet positions are generally anticipated, and adjustments in mid-level positions,
as well as certain institutional reforms, may also be implemented
to align with the new administration’s objectives. In the case
of Bolsonaro’s administration in Brazil, the leadership’s agenda did not
prioritize the federal civil bureaucracy, which was frequently characterized by
the administration as “leftist,” “communist,” or “petista” (a term referring
to supporters of the Workers’ Party, PT). Bolsonaro publicly committed
to “despetizar” the federal government, indicating an intention to remove
individuals perceived as affiliated with the Workers’ Party from government
positions. Notably, during a 2018 campaign rally, Bolsonaro made a
statement in which he threatened to take violent action against
PT supporters.
