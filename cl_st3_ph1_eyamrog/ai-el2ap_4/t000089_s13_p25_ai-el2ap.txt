Educate Together rejects the premise that adherence to a specific
religious or philosophical outlook is necessary for moral or ethical
development or for human well-being. Evidence from Educate Together schools
indicates that establishing a strong value system based on equality
and human rights, and fostering a corresponding school culture, enables
schools to effectively address the educational and social needs of
students and to provide a comprehensive and supportive educational experience
(Rowe, 2016).
