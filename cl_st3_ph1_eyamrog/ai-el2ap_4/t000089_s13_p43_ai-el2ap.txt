The tension between National Curriculum guidelines and religious ethos has
also impacted schools under Catholic patronage, as evidenced by the
negative response of the Catholic Church to the National Council
for Curriculum and Assessment’s (NCCA) 2015 proposal for an ‘Education
about Religions and Beliefs and Ethics’ (ERBE) programme. In its
consultation report, the NCCA recognized the necessity for a differentiated
approach to Religious Education (RE) and Ethics that would critically
and pluralistically examine both theistic and non-theistic worldviews. The report
considered various options for integrating ERBE, either as a standalone
subject or within existing curricular areas such as Social, Personal
and Health Education (SPHE) and Social, Environmental and Scientific Education
(SESE). The NCCA emphasized the importance of enabling patrons to
foster a reflective approach to both religious and non-religious perspectives,
advocating for a pluralist epistemology that examines diverse faiths and
beliefs without privileging any single perspective (Republic of Ireland, National
Council for Curriculum and Assessment, 2015, p. 29). However, some
teachers and bishops representing Catholic denominational schools raised concerns about
the practicality of implementing such a programme, arguing that it
could potentially confuse students by presenting conflicting messages regarding the
validity of their faith.
