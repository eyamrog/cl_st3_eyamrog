In Group 6, the use of emojis such as Clapping
Hands, Smiling Face, and Thumbs-Up by Participant B indicates appreciation
for the discussions on strategies to raise awareness of fake
news in the language classroom, as well as an intention
to implement these ideas in teaching practice. These instances were
coded as indicators of the "resolution" category within the Community
of Inquiry (CoI) framework.
