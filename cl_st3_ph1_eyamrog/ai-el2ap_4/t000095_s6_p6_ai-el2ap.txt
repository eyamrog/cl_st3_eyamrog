The available evidence suggests that there is limited justification for
the observed differences in COVID-19 mortality between Rio de Janeiro
and São Paulo based on factors other than political context.
The COVID-19 crisis has reinforced the established public health principle
that effective political leadership is essential for successful response measures.
The disparity between São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro can
be partially attributed to significant political conflicts in Brazil. The
federal government adopted a denialist stance, failed to develop a
coordinated pandemic response, and did not facilitate collaboration among municipalities,
states, and federal authorities. In Rio de Janeiro, both municipal
and state governments aligned with the federal approach until early
2021, resulting in inadequate preparedness for the pandemic. The impeachment
of the state governor further destabilized the response and may
have contributed to the excess mortality observed. In contrast, the
municipal and state governments in São Paulo implemented coordinated plans
to rapidly increase hospital capacity and improve hospital care, although
preventive measures in both cities remained insufficient to fully address
the pandemic.
