The literature reports that Valeriana officinalis extract has been studied
for its effects on the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder
(GAD) (Andreatini & Leite, 1994; Pakseresht et al., 2011) and
insomnia (Fernández-San-Martín et al., 2011). Evidence also indicates that V.
officinalis can reduce emotional, physical, and behavioral symptoms associated with
premenstrual syndrome (Behboodi et al., 2016). Furthermore, it has been
shown to prevent neuropsychiatric adverse effects, such as sleepiness and
anxiety, in HIV-positive patients (Ahmadi et al., 2017). Additionally, V.
officinalis has demonstrated neuroprotective effects in several neurodegenerative diseases, including
Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease (Pereira et al., 2011).
