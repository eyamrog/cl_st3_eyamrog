Introduction: The mandibular canal (MC), located within the mandible, carries
the inferior alveolar nerve and the inferior alveolar vessels. This
neurovascular bundle is at risk during mandibular surgical procedures. Therefore,
an adequate preoperatively evaluation of the MC could lead to
safer treatment with less postoperative complications.
