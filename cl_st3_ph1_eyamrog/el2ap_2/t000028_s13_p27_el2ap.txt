For Biagini and Gonçalves (2017, p. 8), some important aspects
to be considered are “cooperation, solidarity and respect for differences”
between students, which may be achieved through group activities. In
their research, the authors suggested a reading activity in groups
of four, assigning each student a role (reader, writer, communicator
and coordinator). The activity was organized in three moments: 1)
individual answers to the teachers’ questions and discussions in the
groups to elaborate a collective answer; 2) presentation of the
answers to the whole class and discussion with new answers;
and 3) communicate the conclusions and results of each group
to the whole class. The researchers chose a text from
the Natural Sciences area for the discussion, but it is
possible to adapt such activity for other areas too, including
the English language field. In addition, Biagini and Gonçalves (2017)
carried out an experiment about the importance of water for
vegetables, as well as potability and water treatment. In this
experiment, they identified the importance of the use of multisensory
resources (tactile, olfactory, auditory observations), which help the blind students
to comprehend the explanations.
