On February 26, 2020, the first case of COVID-19 was
reported in São Paulo. It was a 61-year-old man returning
from Italy. More cases were confirmed on the last day
of the month. On March 7, ignoring risks, Bolsonaro visited
the US to dine with President Trump at Palm Beach,
Florida, (afterwards, over twenty members of his delegation tested positive
for COVID- 19; Bolsonaro did not proceed to self-isolate).8 By
late March all 27 Brazilian states had cases, 2,000 tested
positive and the country reported 80 deaths. On March 18,
ABRASCO (the Portuguese acronym for the Brazilian Association of Collective
Health) demanded help for favelas (shanty-towns), such as waivers of
water, electricity and telephone bills, distribution of food and hygienic
kits, hand-washing and mask-usage campaigns, and the implementation of a
Test, Trace, and Isolate (TTI) program.9 Calling the pandemic a
“little flu”, Bolsonaro ignored ABRASCO, scorned medical advice, ridiculed masks
and encouraged people to go back to work.10 He tried
to enforce an economy-first response by drawing a dichotomy of
lives versus livelihoods. According to Bolsonaro, lockdowns were worse than
the virus itself because it produced unemployment, food shortages, domestic
violence and suicide.11 Intimidated by the federal government, though most
local authorities were in fact willing to follow European lockdowns
they only implemented limited restrictions. In April —when the World
Health Organization (WHO) reported over a million cases of COVID-19
worldwide—Bolsonaro promoted a “vertical” quarantine, in which only high-risk groups
like the elderly and people with co-morbidities would be isolated.
It was portrayed as different from “strict” European lockdowns and
as the best means to attain herd immunity.12 The National
Council of State Health Secretaries, professional organizations and former Ministers
of Health denounced “vertical” isolation as criminal and one of
the world’ worst cases of “medical populism,” as an ideological
contestation of assertions based on established scientific knowledge and a
politicization of the health crisis in order to maintain the
loyalty of an authoritarian government.13
