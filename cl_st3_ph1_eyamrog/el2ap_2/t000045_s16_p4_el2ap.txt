One of the difficulties of interviewing method is related to
the construction of the sample of interviewees and the resulting
bias (Martin, 2013). Given that this stageâ€™s goal was to
investigate the dynamics of building and maintaining these alliances, in
our sample, we sought state legislators whose teams could contribute
to find incidences of this phenomenon. We chose representatives (elected
for the 2015-2018 legislature) who had at least 30% of
their votes concentrated in a given region, given the assumption
that legislators with more concentrated votes tend to present a
more particularistic behavior (Carvalho, 2003). Supposing these representatives would tend
to lean more on local brokers, we expected to maximize
the likelihood of accessing accounts of these relationships.
