A Regierungserklärung, which I translate here as ‘policy statement’, is
usually given at the beginning of a chancellor’s mandate as
an inaugural speech. However, under German law, chancellors can give
one at any time and they are generally followed by
a debate (KORTE, 2002, p.452–453; STÜWE 2005, p.21). The term
consists of the words Regierung (‘government’) and Erklärung, which can
mean both explanation and declaration. As such, it is ambiguous
by both referring to an explanation of government policy in
the sense of an interpretation and justification of it in
terms of the situation, and also to an official declaration
and directive clarification of a given situation (PÖRKSEN, 2003, p.40).
