The data concerning the encounters where the adult ‘unintentionally’ performed
more direct interventions, showing the children what to do instead
of considering their suggestions, and presenting them with straight answers
to their questions, caused a decrease in the amount of
time spent engaging in scientific activities, in the communications of
the manifested attitudes, and in the availability to interact in
the group. All this confirms what was previously stated regarding
the effects of the promotion from within. This aspect suggests
that, by proposing activities that do not coincide with the
children’s interests, the adult becomes a substitute to them, making
it more difficult for the children to interact, advance theories,
verify them and share them with their classmates. The children
in an environment where the adult did not listen or
consider their curiosities showed difficulties both in performing scientific attitudes
and handling the interactions within the group. This led the
researcher to intervene multiple times in order to secure a
harmonious context where the activities could continue. This type of
issue did not manifest itself during the encounters of the
other two groups, who followed the promotion from within approach.
