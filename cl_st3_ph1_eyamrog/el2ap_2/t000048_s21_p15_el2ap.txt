The specimens of the NÃºcleo Curucutu present tricolor bracts (red,
yellow and green). The presence of three colors in bracts
is rarely mentioned, both in literature and in the exsiccates
descriptions. We noticed that in many cases there was only
the predominant color, red, recorded, even when a second color
was present in study.
