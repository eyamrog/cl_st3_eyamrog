The last line of inquiry concerns the relevance of other
factors for the selection of brokers besides political parties. As
discussed, the literature in Brazil gives precedence to the study
of party brokers, which are relevant, as the survey we
presented in this paper has shown. However, we found evidence
that other selection methods, such as personal and regional ties,
are also important, although little investigated, probably due to the
difficulty of operationalizing these variables. In order to better understand
the dynamics of multi-level support networks and refine existing theories,
it is crucial to investigate these other factors.
