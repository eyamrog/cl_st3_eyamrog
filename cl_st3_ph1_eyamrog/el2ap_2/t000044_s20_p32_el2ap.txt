Eighty-nine students from the University of International Studies in Xi'an,
China, participated in research that aimed to understand whether tuning
gestures can improve the learning of prosody (part of the
traditional grammar that is dedicated to the characteristics of the
emission of the speech sounds, such as accent and intonation).
The authors Yuan, Gonz√°lez-Fuente, Baills, and Prieto (2019) carried out
their research in which they divided students into two identical
groups, the first group (control group) received intonation training without
the use of tuning gestures. The second group, experimental, received
the same training, but with more tuning gestures, representing contours
of nuclear intonation. The results of the research provide evidence
that the experimental group has improved significantly and that even
though individuals who have stronger skills have obtained a better
result, those who had weaker musical skills have benefited even
more by observing the gestures.
