Twenty-six (37.1%) articles proposed non-adherent dressings for MFW-related pain management.
The studies were non-systematic reviews (65.3%), case studies (19.8%), randomized
clinical trials (3.8%), a guideline (3.8%), prospective cohorts (3.8%), and
a Survey (3.8%). Twenty-five studies (35.7%) did not include pain
management as a primary objective. All studies used dressings with
other therapies such as opioids, anesthetics, and antiseptics. None of
the studies mentioned a standardized way of using them or
described the pain-related specific results from non-adherent dressings alone.
