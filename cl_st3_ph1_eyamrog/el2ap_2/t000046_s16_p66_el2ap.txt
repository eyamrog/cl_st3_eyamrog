In Doña, Jiménez and Gálvez (2014), who raised the official
contents of Chile proposed for PE, there is an introductory
narrative for the search for an PE focused on a
critical practice, similar to the movements that occurred in Brazil
after the 1980s, seeking to show and combat social inequalities;
however, the researchers concluded that teaching could improve the quality
of movements as one of the predominant contents for the
curricular component. We see, then, a tension between the traditional
and the critical perspective, possibly distancing the role of school
physical education from a health approach.
