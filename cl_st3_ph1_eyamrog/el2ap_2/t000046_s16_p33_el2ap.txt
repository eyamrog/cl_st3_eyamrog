In the category “Absence of diseases,” the understanding of health
is strictly biological. For Rigo, Pardo and Silveira (2007), this
characteristic divides society into healthy and sick. This understanding guided
a wide production of knowledge, besides having contributed to the
development of actions that predominated for long years in the
intervention proposals of school PE and that can still be
found (OLIVEIRA; GOMES; BRACHT, 2014).
