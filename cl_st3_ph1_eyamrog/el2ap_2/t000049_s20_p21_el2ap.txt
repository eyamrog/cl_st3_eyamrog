The analysis of the strategies performed by the adult proves
how many interventions are coherent with the ‘promotion from within’
approach adopted by groups A and B (mirroring, in particular).
In these two groups, the purpose of the adult was
soliciting further insights, the continuation of the experience, or the
reflection on it (A=35 and B=36). In comparison to the
other groups, group C is characterized by more interventions to
secure the functioning of the social factors (C=13). This functioning
was activated through accommodating strategies (the adult agrees to play
with the children to establish some rules) or through more
specific guidelines (“Let’s take your kit and see what’s inside?
Is there anything interesting? Let’s try to divide the floating
objects from the sinking ones?”).
