In the mesoregion of the Paraíba hinterland, floristic studies have
been developed in the last five years and have improved
knowledge about the state's flora, contributing to a better understanding
of the flora and vegetation of Caatinga areas (Lucena et
al. 2015, Torres et al. 2016, Brito et al. 2018,
Costa et al. 2019, Fernando et al. 2021). The present
study consists of a floristic survey of ABA farm, in
the municipality of Passagem, Paraíba State, Northeast Brazil.
