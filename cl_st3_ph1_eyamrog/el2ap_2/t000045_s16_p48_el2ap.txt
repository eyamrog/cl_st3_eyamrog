The interviews present a strong evidence that offices allocate much
time, energy, and personnel to assist municipalities and civic organizations
(referred to as “entities”) so they can meet the administrative
requirements for accessing resources from upper levels of government. These
actions show the informational role that state legislators’ offices exercise
for mayors and local leaders. Through these activities, legislators’ offices
try to mitigate municipalities’ deficiencies in terms of human resources
and technical expertise to deal with complex issues related to
legal requirements.
