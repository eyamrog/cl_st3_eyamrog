Policy statements are instruments of leadership of German chancellors and
their increasing use over time is part of a mediatised
democracy: as a public presentation, such policy statements receive particular
attention by the media and thus serve as a visualised
personification of government policy (KORTE, 2002, p.453). As they are
an instrument of government that is both publicly effective and
inwardly coordinative, policy statements are usually based on a range
of sources, scientists, surveys, contemporaries or a range of other
voices whose composition are a sign of the personal style
of the chancellor (KORTE, 2002, p.460–461). Studies of this genre
in German political discourse studies have concentrated on the inaugural
policy statements given by chancellors at the beginning of their
mandate (BARNICKEL, 2020; BUSCH & KAUPERT, 2018; STÜWE, 2005), but
studies of strategies of legitimisation have been conducted regularly (see,
for instance, REYES, 2011).
