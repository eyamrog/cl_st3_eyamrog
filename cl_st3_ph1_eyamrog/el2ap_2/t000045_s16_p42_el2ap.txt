Among the interviewees’ legislators’ offices, most are organized, among other
objectives, to assist the municipalities. In all of them, there
is an internal division of labor and an effort to
balance the “technical” and “political” parts of the staff. On
the “political side” (as the advisors call it), priority is
given to people linked to local communities, who have connections
to mayors, local leaders, and social groups; people who have
served the legislators for a long time, who worked in
the last electoral campaign, and who have access to Executive
agencies. On the “technical” side, they value essential skills in
office management (secretariat, communication, legal advising, legislative process) as well
as expertise and experience in key policy areas, such as
health and education.
