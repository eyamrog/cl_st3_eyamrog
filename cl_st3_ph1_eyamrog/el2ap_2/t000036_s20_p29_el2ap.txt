We have not found reports that clearly show the application
of this body of labor laws in the sectors described,
this is logical or, at least, predictable, due to the
high rate of informality in the private sector and because
the functionality of the public sector, apart from Guayaquil and
Quito, it was extremely weak. Despite this, it is highly
likely that this legal body on labor has been applied
in the centralized public sector and even in a certain
part of the industrial sector; however, it is very probably
that it was not applied in most of the informal
sector.
