Again. What are the suggestions to consider in order to
organize and handle an experience similar to that described in
the previous paragraph, adapting in the everyday work at school?
In particular, how to create small groups of children at
a specific time of the day and collect the proper
documentation through video recordings or old-style observation with paper and
pen to later analyze it with colleagues? The reflection on
what needs to be done should not depend on the
data collected on the experience nor on the planning intention.
This process of contemplation of the action (Schön, 1993) that
holds together the planning intention, its perpetration, and its documentation,
aimed at evaluating its unfolding and the possible corrections, implicates
specific choices from the teacher. In particular, these decisions concern
both the organization of the activities and the use of
the “evaluation” tool. Therefore, the evaluation process aims to “regulate”
the learning process and gather inputs in order to sustain
them by improving the context, instead of judging the children’s
performances.
