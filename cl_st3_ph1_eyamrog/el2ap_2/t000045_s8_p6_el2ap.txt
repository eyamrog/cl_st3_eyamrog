There are several ways to build partnerships, especially through friendships
and geographical proximity. We show evidence that reputation is an
essential element in the selection of brokers and that political
parties matter more as potential veto points, depending on the
configuration of local politics, than as criteria for structuring alliances.
Our analysis also shows that the electoral payoff of partnerships
for legislators is far from guaranteed. It involves many uncertainties
and a significant effort to acquire information, negotiate, and establish
priorities for assisting a local politician. Moreover, we concluded that
electoral defeats are the main reasons for relationship break-ups and
that representatives do not show a willingness to punish local
brokers when they do not deliver what is expected.
