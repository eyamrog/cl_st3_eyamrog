In 2015, in the USA, Weinberg, Fukawa-Connelly, and Wiesner (2015)
published research that sought to understand how gestures can help
in thinking and communicating in the discipline of Mathematics. The
research took place at a public university in an introductory
abstract algebra discipline. The results indicated that the mathematical meanings
- specific and general - are expressed in gestures and
highlight the integrated nature of the elements of the semiotic
package.
