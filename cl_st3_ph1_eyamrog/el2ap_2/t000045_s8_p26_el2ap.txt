Turning our attention to studies on distributive politics in Brazil,
we find evidence that: (i) voters incorporate local concerns in
their voting decision which inclines them to choose legislators with
a reputation for bringing resources to the municipality; (ii) a
significant share of legislators strive to allocate resources and provide
services to municipalities; (iii) local leaders, especially mayors, perform a
significant role in winning votes for legislators; and (iv) allocating
resources to municipalities brings electoral returns for both legislators and
mayors.
