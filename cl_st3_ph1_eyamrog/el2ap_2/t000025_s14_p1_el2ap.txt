A scoping review was conducted according to the JBIÂ® approach
developed to map key concepts, clarify definitions, define boundaries of
a subject, summarize information, and describe research and clinical gaps
(Peters et al., 2020). Unlike a systemic review that focuses
on treatment effectiveness, a scoping review is a rigorous undertaking
to conduct a comprehensive search for all the available literature
about a subject without stringent methodological restriction.
