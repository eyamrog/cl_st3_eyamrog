The measurement tool used to assess the quality of the
dentures made in the village was a questionnaire, which indicated
the level of patient satisfaction and represents the most common
measurement resource to assess the success of treatment13,27,28. The quality
of the “dentures in one day” was evaluated positively, if
the averages given by patients for the upper and lower
dentures in criteria such as satisfaction (9.8 and 8.9, respectively),
chewing (9.9 and 8.4, respectively) and stability (9.7 and 8.0,
respectively) are considered, corroborating the principle that simplified techniques are
just as effective as dentures obtained through more traditional techniques16.
The high scores recorded are possibly because the dentures met
the expectations of the patients, of which, among the several
reported, the most cited were the expectation to improve one’s
smile and to chew better. According to Owen29 recording expectations
in relation to comfort, function and aesthetics is fundamental in
the pre-treatment phase, so that these are observed during the
preparation of the dentures. It is also important to establish
a good relationship between the dentist and the patient30, since
the psychological aspects of prosthetic therapy are as important as
technical factors for the success of the treatment31.
