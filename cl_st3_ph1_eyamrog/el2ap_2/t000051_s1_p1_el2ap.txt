This article applies Bakhtinian dialogism and the concept of centripetal-centrifugal
struggle to critical discourse studies to analyse how powerful and
marginalised discourses are brought into competition in political language to
justify paradigm changes. I analyse German chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Zeitenwende
(‘watershed’) speech, which he gave as a response to the
Russian invasion of Ukraine, announcing a radical armament programme and
change in foreign policy, a paradigm shift that had previously
been unthinkable in German politics. Based on a qualitative analysis
using the Appraisal Theory strategies Attitude and Engagement, I identify
how Scholz aligns himself with particular powerful discourses, centring some
powerful ones and marginalising others, constructing an existential threat for
Germany, the so-called watershed, a new situation which casts his
policies of German armament as without alternative. The paper demonstrates
the strength of the analysis of dialogically contractive and expansive
strategies in critical discourse studies.
