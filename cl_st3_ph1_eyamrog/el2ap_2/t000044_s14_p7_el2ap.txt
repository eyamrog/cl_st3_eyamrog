Therefore, after the selection of the 69 articles according to
the established criteria, we opted to separate teaching levels at
first, so that it was possible to identify at which
stage of the academic trajectory there is a greater presence
of research on gestures in the process of teaching and
learning. We also made a historical sequence of the articles
by publication date, so we could detect if there is
an increase or not of publication in gestures, indicating an
increase in research interest. The final grouping of the articles
found in phase 1 was made after reading the content
of each article, and the categories emerged from reading them
naturally.
