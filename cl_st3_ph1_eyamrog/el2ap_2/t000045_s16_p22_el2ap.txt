In non-election years, councilors mediate the allocation of resources to
social organizations. Since this type of operation does not need
to go through the mayor’s office, they are essential in
municipalities where the representative “does not have the mayor”, and
the councilor can exercise the mediation independently. When a councilor
resorts to the representatives for a more collective nature request,
some articulation with the Executive becomes necessary, since they are
responsible for the execution. In these cases, there may be
a credit dispute, and a positive outcome depends on the
mayor’s goodwill. Nevertheless, most of the time, interviewees stated that
this transaction occurs without major setbacks. After all, it is
costly for mayors to decline resources and benefits for the
municipality even when these come from the hands of an
opposittion councilor or political group.
