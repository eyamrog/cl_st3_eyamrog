Nine legislators6 from the chosen state region7 met the above
requirement. Six had been re-elected in 2018 for the 2019-2022
term, and three could not get re-elected. Given the impossibility
of conducting interviews with advisors of two legislators, we replaced
these cases with two legislators who had at least 20%
of their votes concentrated in the region. A total of
ten interviews were conducted, with nine chiefs of staff and
one adviser of nine different state representatives.8 We chose to
interview advisors and not the legislators based on the assumption
that they would be more accessible and have a broader
view of the mandate. From the ten advisors interviewed, only
one worked in the regional office.
