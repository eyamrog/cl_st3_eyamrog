From 2000 onwards, other laws and decrees were proclaimed in
Brazil. The most relevant ones include the National Guidelines for
Special Education in Basic Education (Diretrizes Nacionais para Educação Especial
na Educação Básica) and the National Special Education Policy from
the Perspective of Inclusive Education (Política Nacional de Educação Especial
da Perspectiva da Educação Inclusiva). The latter policy guarantees the
right of students with any disability to attend public schools,
while the former aims to put that democratization into practice,
ensuring accessibility and inclusion to all (ALVES, 2017).
