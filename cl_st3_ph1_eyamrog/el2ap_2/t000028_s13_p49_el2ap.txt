The “Vocabulary Corner” (pages 154 to 165) encompasses 13 activities
about the vocabulary learned in all the eight units of
the textbook, so the adapted material suggested in this paper
can be used throughout the year and explored in a
variety of activities. In addition, it is noticeable that all
the activities belonging to this section have visual elements, such
as pictures and drawings, without any adaptation proposals for blind
students.
