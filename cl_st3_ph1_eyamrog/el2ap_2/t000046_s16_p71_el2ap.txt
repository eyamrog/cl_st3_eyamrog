Zappe and Dellâ€™Aglio (2016) point to the experimental phase, covering
inappropriate eating habits and sports practices, antisocial behavior, use of
substances such as alcohol, cigarettes and drugs, risky sexual behavior,
suicidal behavior and violence, emphasizing that this scenario may be
related to lack of parental support. In this sense, schools
should be attentive to these situations and be welcoming.
