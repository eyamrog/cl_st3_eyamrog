However, our evidence suggests that political parties may not be
the only element structuring alliances, nor even the major. Thus,
we refocus our efforts not in understanding whether party affinities
matter, but under what conditions they lose in importance to
other factors (which are less trivial to measure, but count
when choosing partners and forming alliances). In the in-depth interviews,
chiefs of staff were unanimous in stressing the little or
no importance of political parties in building local alliances. In
general, they tended to say that the representatives have alliances
with leaders of various parties and that affiliation is not
the most crucial criterion. One could object that this is
due to the profile of the legislators we focused on
in our interviews (votes concentrated in adjacent municipalities). But, even
in the survey conducted with a wider range of legislators,
only a minority (14% and 21% of the interviewees, in
2007 and 2012, respectively) pointed out party relations as the
most important reason for obtaining mayors’ and councilors’ support.
