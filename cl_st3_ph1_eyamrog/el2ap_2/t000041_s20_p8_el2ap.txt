Some floristic studies were carried out in Caatinga areas in
the interior of Para√≠ba (Santos et al. 2010, Lucena et
al. 2015, Silva et al. 2015, Gadelha-Neto et al. 2018),
which in terms of vegetation have a similarity of species
with this study. As in previous studies, the most representative
family in species number in the ABA Farm is Fabaceae,
which reaffirms it as one of the most abundant plant
families in the Caatinga.
