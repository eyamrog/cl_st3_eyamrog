The literature has also indicated that female university students are
more vulnerable to anxiety (Blanco et al., 2021) and to
taking anxiolytic medication (Martínez-Líbano et al., 2023). This evidence suggests
the need for a more detailed analysis of possible sex-related
differences. Although there are studies in this regard, the prevalence
of anxiety and the use of anxiolytic medications are usually
treated separately in the national literature. Similarly, national empirical studies
on prevalence tend to focus on samples of medical students
(Chattu et al., 2020; Souza et al., 2022) and nursing
students (Marchi et al., 2013; Paixão, et al., 2021).
