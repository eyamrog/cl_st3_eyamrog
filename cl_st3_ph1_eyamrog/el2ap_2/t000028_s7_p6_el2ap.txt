Presently, many types of physical, mental and sensorial impairments are
broadly known and discussed in Brazil, along with the education
of impaired students. However, not long ago, those students used
to be addressed by means of pejorative and discriminative terms.
Until the 1970’s, people with any disability were segregated from
society and deprived of their rights, such as to receive
a proper education. Nationally, the situation started changing in the
60’s and 70’s decades, with the creation of the first
Law of Guidelines and Bases of National Education and of
the National Center for Special Education (CENESP)6, which began to
regularize, respectively, the “normalization”7 of people with disability and their
right to education (ALVES, 2017, p. 15). Since then, three
other laws regarding guidelines and bases of national education emerged:
Law 4.024/61 (1961), concerning education and ensuring the Brazilian population
the right to schooling; Law 5.692 (1971), establishing guidelines and
bases for high school education, among other measures; and Law
9.394/96 (1994), which is current, asserting the responsibilities of the
governments (municipal, state and federal) with the three Brazilian educational
stages (preschool, primary school and high school).
