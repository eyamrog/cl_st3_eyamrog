Depending on the type of Event and on the Series
to which it belonged, Factors III (Hope) and XI (Receptivity)
showed specific patterns of change. The mean presence value of
Factor III (Hope) was reduced as soon as the possibility
of the team to be disqualified increased or was already
defined. Even so, this Factor was present in all Events
of the study period. This PMSL Factor was present in
the early international competition phases among elite voleyball players, although
the values did not continue to be high during the
course of the competition (Di Bonif√°cio, 2013). Pujals and Vieira
(2002) also observed that Hope was a positive psychological Factor
among youth soccer players, influencing performance in the field.
