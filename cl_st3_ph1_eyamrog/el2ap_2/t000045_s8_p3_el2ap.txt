To investigate these questions, we combined survey data with state
representatives from twelve Brazilian states and evidence from in-depth interviews
with state representatives' advisors. In this way, we sought to
portray the relationships between state legislators and local brokers across
a broad range of states and to identify the micro-foundations
of these alliances and the mediation dynamics that characterize them.
We do not intend to carry out a systematic test
of hypotheses. Instead, this is an exploratory study, but one
with the potential to reorient studies on the subject, insofar
as it investigates the mechanisms underlying the relationships between legislators
and brokers. Our main contribution is to point out theoretical
and empirical pathways for this field of research. Our study
also differs from the literature in another aspect. We shift
our attention from federal legislators, the target of most investigations
on the subject, to state representatives, stressing similarities and differences.
