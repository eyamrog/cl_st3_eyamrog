Table 4 reveals that, during the data collection period, participants
used twenty- one different medications. Anxiolytic BZDs (Diazepam and Clonazepam)
were the most commonly consumed, followed by antidepressants of the
SSRI class (Escitalopram, Citalopram, and Fluoxetine) and ADTs (Amitriptyline), respectively.
These data provide information on the most commonly used medications
by survey participants.
