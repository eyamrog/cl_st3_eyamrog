The present study also demonstrated that participants use a variety
of medications to cope with anxiety symptoms, with BZDs being
the most commonly used, followed by SSRIs and ADTs, respectively.
It is noteworthy that the data presented provide information on
the most commonly used medications by the participants at the
time of the survey data collection. In this context, anxiolytics
are considered to be all psychotropic drugs classified as antidepressants,
antipsychotics, BZDs, barbiturates, and other sedative-hypnotic medications that act on
mild to severe anxiety symptoms (Morris et al., 2021).
