Undoubtedly, there are certain challenges EAL teachers may find when
having blind students in class: students may be unmotivated or
discouraged, both the student or the teacher may be unfamiliar
with Braille and other accessible materials, the blind students may
not feel included by their own classmates, among others (BENWELL,
2022)8. Therefore, it is important for teachers to be patient
and try to create a comfortable environment, in which students
are not afraid of speaking out and making mistakes. As
teachers, we need to keep in mind that a blind
student is first and foremost a student and their condition
comes secondly, that is, blind students need to receive equal
treatment as their sighted classmates, even though their learning methods
may be different.
