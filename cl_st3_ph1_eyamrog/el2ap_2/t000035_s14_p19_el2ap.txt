Initially, a descriptive analysis of the sample was carried out
through the distribution of frequencies, measures of central tendency and
variability. Since the data did not meet the assumptions of
parametric analysis, Wilcoxon's nonparametric tests were used to compare the
impact of oral health on quality of life between the
stages (t0 and t1) and to compare patients' perception of
the upper and lower dentures. The comparison between patients' perception
of chewing different foods was performed using the Friedman tests.
The effect size was calculated. All analyzes were performed using
the R1program, with a 5% significance level.
