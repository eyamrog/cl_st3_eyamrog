For activity F, teachers can use a song about the
different forms of greetings. There are many options available on
the internet, so the teacher can choose which one(s) they
want to play for the class. Yet, searching for options
we suggest the video entitled “Hello Song for Kids -
Greeting Song for Kids - The Singing Walrus”14, available at
The Singing Walrus channel on YouTube, because it is more
interactive and is related to students’ routines.
