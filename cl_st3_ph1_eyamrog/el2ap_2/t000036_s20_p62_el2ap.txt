The minimum salary was legalized in 1936, after a series
of labor problems and political agreements. It should be taken
into account that as of 1932 the stability of Ecuadorian
politics was very weak, with around 12 people as representatives
of the executive power until 1940. In 1934 occurred one
of the most important labor conflicts of the decade, the
paralysis of the La Internacional factory, one of the most
important textile industries in the country. According to the Ministry
of Government and Social Security, in its Report to the
Nation, it mentions that one of the main requests of
the leaders of the strike was “that the minimum wage
of 1.50 sucres be established in eight hours of work”
(Baquerizo 1934:74).
