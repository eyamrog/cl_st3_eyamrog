Unlike most studies on brokerage between officeholders in Brazil, which
rely on quantitative analyses, we employ a multi-method approach in
this paper. We integrate quantitative and qualitative descriptive evidence to
answer the following questions: how are relationships between state representatives
and local politicians constructed, maintained, and ended? Do the principal-agent
models that inform much of the analysis in comparative politics
provide an appropriate framework to describe and analyze these relationships
in the Brazilian case?
