Only one case study (1.4%) (Maida, 2017) proposed using medicinal
cannabis as topical and vaporized oil as part of the
MFW pain management armamentarium. The case focused on a 44-year-old
male patient diagnosed with squamous cell cancer in the oral
cavity, resulting in a MFW on the right hemiface. The
patient rated the pain between 9 and 10/10 at baseline,
and treatment included intravenous analgesia. After receiving the vaporized medicinal
cannabis every 2 to 4 hours, and before changing the
dressing or digitally applying and spreading 1-2 ml of the
oil throughout the wound, externally and intra-orally, the patient reported
significant pain relief, with his pain score was reduced to
3 and 4, this improvement allowed for a modification of
the analgesic regimen. This is the first case report demonstrating
the potential of topical medicinal cannabis for effective MFW pain
management.
