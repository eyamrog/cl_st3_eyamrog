In order to contribute to knowledge of the epidemiology of
American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) among indigenous people living in sylvatic
regions, we studied the sand fly fauna collected in areas
of disease transmission in the Brazilian Amazon. Our two datasets
reported here are comprised of occurrence data for sand flies
from the Suruwaha Indigenous Land in the state of Amazonas
collected between 2012-1013, and the Wajãpi Indigenous Land in the
state of Amapá collected between 2013-2014. Sand flies were collected
using unbaited CDC-like light traps at various sites within each
study area and were identified to species-level by taxonomists with
expertise in Amazonian fauna. A total of 4,646 records are
reported: 1,428 from the Suruwaha and 3,218 from the Wajãpi.
These records will contribute to a better understanding of ACL
transmission dynamics, as well as the distribution of insect vectors,
in these areas.
