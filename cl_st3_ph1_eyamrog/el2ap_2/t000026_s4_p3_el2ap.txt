In the national context, there are no studies investigating the
relationship between anxiety and the use of anxiolytics in students
from different undergraduate courses in the health area. Existing research
tends to focus on medical or nursing students. This gap
represents a challenge for universities and researchers, who need to
conduct studies in this area to reflect the national reality
and contribute to the implementation of preventive actions, as well
as to evaluate their evolution and impact.
