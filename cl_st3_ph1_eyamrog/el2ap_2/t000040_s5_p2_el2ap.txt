Although CBCT is of great importance in the daily oral
and maxillofacial practice, it can only show the MC and
not the nerve itself; yet CBCT is the best technique
for pre-surgery radiographic planning such as implants placement and surgical
extraction of the third molar, etc. Being able to delimit
the MC can assist the surgeon and prevent potential surgical
problems.
