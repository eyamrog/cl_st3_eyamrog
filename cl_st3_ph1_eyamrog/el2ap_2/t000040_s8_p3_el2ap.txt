In a study investigating the vertical positioning of the IAN
in 39 edentulous human cadaveric mandibles, Kieser et al. found
30.7% (12 out of 39) of IAN located in the
superior part of the body of the mandible, and 69.2%
(27 out of 39) half‚Äêway or closer to the inferior
border of the mandible [8].
