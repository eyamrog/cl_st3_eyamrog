Notwithstanding the low levels of party identification and the personalization
associated with it’s open-list proportional representation, it is unlikely that
parties do not play an important role in the Brazilian
electoral process. After all, political parties remain the exclusive channel
for running for a public office, and control vital resources
in the electoral process – funding, political advertising time on
television and radio, and other organizational resources. Moreover, it is
natural that studies should focus on party labels, since it’s
an easily available variable.
