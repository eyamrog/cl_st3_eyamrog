By the end of 2020, Brazil and India had the
world’s second and third highest number of coronavirus deaths respectively.
Both nations were led by right-wing authoritarian populist leaders: Bolsonaro
(elected as the Brazilian President in 2019) and Modi from
the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party or BJP (re-elected as
the Indian Prime Minister for a second term in 2019).
In his first major speech on March 24, 2020, Bolsonaro
asserted that Brazil was not particularly vulnerable to the virus.5
At the same time, Modi clamped down on the media
for being too pessimistic about the pandemic while the Indian
Council of Medical Research (ICMR), with a view to pleasing
the Prime Minister, promised that the coronavirus vaccine would be
ready by July 2020. In both countries there was a
disconnect between the facts on the ground related to the
pandemic and the leaders’ narratives. The main political authority during
the pandemic in both Brazil and India has been a
charismatic president who generally viewed mainstream scientists as opponents.6
