The bucco-lingual position of the MC and the topography of
the IAN were investigated using three-dimensional reconstruction by Kim et
al. on sixty-two mandible sides. The researchers conclude that 70%
of the canals followed the lingual aspect at the ramus
and the mandibular body, 15% were located at the middle
of the ramus behind the second molar and lingually when
passing through the second and first molars, and the last
15% followed the middle or the lingual third of the
mandible from the ramus to the body. On the other
side, also according to Kim et al., the inferior alveolar
vessels were above the IAN in 80% and in 20%
lateral to it [10].
