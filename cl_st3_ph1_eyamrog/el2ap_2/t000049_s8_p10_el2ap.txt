“…ability and willingness to use the body of knowledge and
methodology employed to explain the natural world, in order to
identify questions and to draw evidence-based conclusions. Competence in technology
is viewed as the application of that knowledge and methodology
in response to perceived human wants or needs. Competence in
science and technology involves an understanding of the changes caused
by human activity and responsibility as an individual citizen.” (Recommendation
of the European parliament and of the council on key
competences for lifelong learning, 2006, p. 15).
