"Leonardo notices a piece of cardboard from the broken kitchen
paper roll. After a few moments, Leonardo says: "Here it
is broken". He looks around, approaches a box and takes
a roll of blue tape. He shows it to me
and shows me the corner that has been raised in
the cardboard roll and says: "I have to fix it!".
Looking at the roll of tape he tries to find
the point where you can lift it to get a
piece. Peter and Alice approach him. Leonardo starts to pull
the piece of cellotape, he pulls hard, looks at the
cardboard roll of and that of the cellotape and says:
"How do you do it... how do you do it?".
Alice proposes: "If we take scissors, we can cut it."
