The literature has already documented the uncertain nature of these
partnerships in Brazil and other cases (Bezerra, 1999; Aspinall, 2014;
Novaes, 2018). Nevertheless, unlike this evidence, our interviewees expressed less
frequently their disappointment with mayors or other local brokers in
terms of betrayal or opportunistic and predatory behavior. When questioned
in these terms, interviewees showed empathy regarding the pressures mayors
deal with.
