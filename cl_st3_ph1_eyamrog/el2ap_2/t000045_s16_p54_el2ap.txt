Our interviews suggest a more reactive behavior of state legislators,
similar to what Nichter (2018) showed regarding the relationship between
politicians and voters. According to him, politicians often react to
voter requests by solving their demands. But, it is important
to note that representatives can also be proactive. One of
the interviewees, for example, stated that there are “many things
that the state provides” and mayors are not aware. In
this case, the office mediates to deliver a benefit to
the municipality, a dynamic also highlighted by Bezerra (1999, p.
121).
