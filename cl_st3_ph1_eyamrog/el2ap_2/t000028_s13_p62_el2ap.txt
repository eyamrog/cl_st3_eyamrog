Instead of working with images and filling in the blanks
exercises, the EAL teacher could ask students to search on
the internet or in books for a career they would
like to pursue in the future. This research can be
made at home, with the assistance of the students’ parents,
relatives or friends, to be presented for their classmates in
class. In a circle, each student explains briefly the career
they chose, and their classmates can guess which occupation is
being described. At the end, the student can confirm their
answer by completing the sentence “I want to be a…”.
