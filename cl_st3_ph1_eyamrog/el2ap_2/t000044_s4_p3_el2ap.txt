During the normal speech, when we detail our thinking or
try to explain a concept or specially a scientific model
to a teacher or classmate, we end up using gestures
to express ourselves. Those gestures are acutely important, as it
is possible through them to find out studentâ€™s mental images
and often there is an opportunity to understand gaps in
the student's speech. Therefore, we also conclude our literature review
assessing the important role that gestures can play in the
teaching- learning process, bringing new perspectives and paths for education,
as well as new resources that aim to contribute to
the students' academic formation.
