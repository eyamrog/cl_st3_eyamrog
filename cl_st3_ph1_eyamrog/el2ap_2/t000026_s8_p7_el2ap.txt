To support this perspective, the relationship between the use of
anxiolytic medications and anxiety has been mainly investigated among university
students. A global study conducted by Auerbach et al. (2018)
revealed that 12.6% of university students with anxious symptoms were
using these medications. Among the most commonly used are benzodiazepines
(BZDs; 5.9%), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; 3.9%), and serotonin-norepinephrine
reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs; 2.2%). In Brazil, a study found that
24.3% of medical students used antidepressant and/or anxiolytic drugs (Souza
et al., 2022).
