The dressing application and removal technique for MFW-related pain management
was not categorized as a topical therapy. However, several studies
alluded to various dressing application techniques and conditions and their
effect on pain. Twenty-one (30%) studies proposed procedures related to
the dressing technique to minimize pain. The studies were non-systematic
reviews (66%), guidelines (14%), randomized clinical trials (10%), a case
study (5%), and a survey (5%). In general, the authors
proposed cleaning the wound with an appropriately warm solution, applying
and removing dressings carefully, refraining from debridement due to the
risk of bleeding, maintaining a moist environment in the wound
bed, cleaning with soap with an appropriate pH, reducing the
frequency of dressing changes, and providing analgesia before applying the
dressing.
