Case studies included in this review used NPWT to manage
symptoms of MFWs and reported favorable results, increasing patients' quality
of life. Although NPWT is contraindicated for MFWs, this therapy
should be adequately studied in palliative care (Riot et al.,
2015). Negative pressure creates a closed environment for the wound,
thereby controlling moisture, removing excess exudate, reducing microbial load, promoting
perfusion, stimulating mitosis, and granulation tissue formation. These latter actions
are contraindicated for in patients with MFWs, because mitosis is
not desired and granulation is not the primary objective for
wound management (Cai et al., 2017). Furthermore, malignant cells can
induce the formation of new blood vessels, which are friable,
requiring careful evaluation and caution when using NPWT on MFWs
due to the risk of bleeding (Firmino et al., 2021).
