Even though the Brazilian Education Ministry provides adaptations in Braille
textbooks available from the National Textbook Program (Programa Nacional do
Livro Didático – PNLD5) and required by schools, it is
important for the teachers to be familiar with other adapted
materials, in order to be able to choose the best
method according to the students’ abilities and learning styles. Such
adaptations are meaningful not only for blind students, who will
be included in activities they would not be able to
participate otherwise, but also for teachers, as they can explore
different materials that may work for the whole group, either
sighted or non-sighted learners.
