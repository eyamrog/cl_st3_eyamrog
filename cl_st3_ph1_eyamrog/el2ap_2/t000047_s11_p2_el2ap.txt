The terminologies of system and system network are salient here.
In Butlerâ€™s (1985) conceptualization, a system is an enumerated set
of choices in a specific environment, composing of items which
have possible alternatives in the sphere of its utility. In
other words, a system provides the possibility of freedom of
choosing a specific mode to execute particular task (Kress, 1981;
Dalamu & Ogunlusi, 2020). A system network is a map
that shows the elements of choice in communication activities, considerable
as one of the innovative concepts of the Hallidayan linguistics.
On that ground, Halliday and Matthiessen (2014) describe a system
network as the optional potential available to a communicator. The
system network allows an analyst to map out the overall
organization of semiotic resources. The system network is a chart
that exemplifies optional variables available in textual resources.
