The centrality attributed to brokers who hold elective office as
opposed to the other representatives’ local supporters shows that it
is crucial to better understand this kind of broker and
what they bring to this relationship. As elected representatives, mayors
and councilors are subject to control and monitoring by their
bosses in part of the time. In the rest of
the time, while acting as bosses, they demand resources (pork
barrel budget amendments and electoral support), differently from the rewards
that the literature generally identifies for brokers. Even those who
agree that there is a very diverse range of brokers’
types (Aspinall, 2014; Holland & Palmer-Rubin, 2015; Mares & Young,
2016) tend to neglect this distinction between elected and non-elected
brokers. We speculate that this distinction must imply in different
relationship patterns with bosses. One way to clarify these differences
is to invest in more research focused on the brokers
themselves.
