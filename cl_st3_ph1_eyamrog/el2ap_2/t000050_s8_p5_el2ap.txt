Health and disease conditions among indigenous people in Brazil are
poorly known. There is a huge gap in government databases
on morbidity, mortality, disease notification, etc, which prevent the construction
of the most basic socio-demographic and health indicators. However, the
few studies on the public health of populations of indigenous
people in Brazil show a situation of marginalization and vulnerability,
which translate into low quality of life, difficulty in accessing
services in general, and low health indicators [7].
