Do children understand iconic gestures about events as early as
iconic gestures about entities? From this question, Glasser et al.
(2018) aim to understand whether children understand iconic gestures that
characterize events as early as possible and, if so, whether
their understanding is influenced by gesture production patterns in their
native language. The research found that native patterns of gesture
production influenced the understanding of the gestures of children that
characterize these events, with a better understanding of gestures that
follow specific language patterns compared to those that do not
follow these patterns, especially in the way of movement of
gestures.
