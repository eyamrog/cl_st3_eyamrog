From the beginning, researchers were faced with a complex environmental
and intercultural context, in which the simple intensification of standard
measures recommended by health services proved to be insufficient or
even antagonistic in relation to the health principles and concepts
of the indigenous group. Difficult access to villages made it
difficult to map and record possible transmission sites. The long
incubation period of the ACL, the complex mobility profile through
their territory of the Wajãpi and the limitations of the
health services, i.e. lack of trained personnel, lack of proper
funding and infrastructure, made the search for transmission foci, according
to the surveillance standards recommended by the Ministry of Health
– based on the search for individual risk factors, an
unpromising task.
