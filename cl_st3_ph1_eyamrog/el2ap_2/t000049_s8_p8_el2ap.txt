The scientific literature on the topic (Giordano, 2010; Andersson, Gullberg,
2014; Bertolino, Guerra, Schenetti, Antonietti, 2017) maintains that scientific education
cannot be limited to the transmission of contents. Every child
is born with plenty of curiosities, questions, and interests that
the adult needs to recognize - even when they begin
their journey in education -, support and enhance through a
specific approach. This approach must be aimed at promoting and
supporting their interests and discoveries in order to encourage further
investigations and learning processes (Bondioli, Savio, 2014). Considering this point
of view, even the Indicazioni Nazionali per il curricolo of
2012 (updated in “Nuovi scenari”, 2018) deal with scientific education
in “La conoscenza del mondo” with a particular focus on
the child’s curiosity, his interest in the phenomena he observes,
his ability to ask questions about them and investigate further,
and his eagerness to share his discoveries with his classmates
and teachers.
