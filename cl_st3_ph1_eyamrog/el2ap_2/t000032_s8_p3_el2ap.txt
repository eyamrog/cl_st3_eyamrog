Studies about athletes’ mood states have followed the same tradition,
particularly using the Profile of Mood States – POMS (Chennaoui
et al., 2016; Morgan, 1980), which has just one positive
factor (Vigor) and five negative factors (Tension, Depression, Confusion, Angry
and Fatigue), and has been pointed out as a limitation
for the advancement of theoretical models and methods of intervention
in this field (Hagtvet & Hanin, 2007; Hanin, 2012; Hernández,
2016; Prapavessis, 2000). Even with that, POMS has been widely
used to investigate mood states in sport over the world.
