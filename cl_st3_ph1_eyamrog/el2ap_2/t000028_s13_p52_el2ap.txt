Referring to unit 3, there are three activities. The first
one suggests a review on vocabulary about Occupations, in which
images are presented and the student must write the corresponding
word. The second one concerns the Months of the Year,
presenting an incomplete calendar for the students to add the
correct months. And the third activity, which is about Countries
and Nationalities: there are images of flags and students are
required to identify the country and the nationality they refer
to.
