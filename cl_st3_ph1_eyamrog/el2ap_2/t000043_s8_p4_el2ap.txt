A SCCS design is suitable for independent recurrent events as
well as rare non- recurrent events. Some of the assumptions
that make SCCS applicable include: the observed events are rare;
the occurrence of an event must not alter the probability
of subsequent exposure that is, if the events are consecutive,
they should be independent; the occurrence of the event of
interest must not censor or affect the observation period and
that the observation period for each individual is independent of
the event times. The latter can be violated in the
event of death (1,2,4,5,7).
