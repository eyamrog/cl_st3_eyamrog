The insects were stored in microtubes containing 70% alcohol and
sorted from the other insects collected either in the field
or under a dissecting microscope in the laboratory. The insects
were clarified and mounted on a slide to identify the
species, using the identification key of Galati (2003) [2]. A
subsample of the insects will be deposited in the Coleção
de Flebotomíneos of the Instituto René Rachou/FIOCRUZ-Minas (COLFLEB/FIOCRUZ).
