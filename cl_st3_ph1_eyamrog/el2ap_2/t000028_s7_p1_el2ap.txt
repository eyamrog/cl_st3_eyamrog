Teaching an additional language is a challenging and demanding task
since teachers need to be aware of the necessity to
create a safe and productive environment, in which students feel
comfortable to express themselves, creating a good rapport (HUGHEY, 2011).
The main purpose of an additional language class is to
make students think about and use language critically by means
of engaging themselves in multimodal genres so that they comprehend
language as “constitutive of situated social practices” (MOTTA-ROTH, HEBERLE, 2015,
p. 2).
