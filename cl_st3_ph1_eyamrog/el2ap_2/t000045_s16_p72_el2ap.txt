Communication between office staff seems to be an important source
of information for state representatives. This is how, for example,
an advisor gets to know if an allied or soliciting
mayor has also been requesting help and pledging votes in
other offices. The legislator’s local networks and visits to the
municipality are also important to estimate how much mayors have
dedicated themselves to mobilizing voters during the campaign. In addition,
mayors’ invitations to attend the inauguration of public works and
other events are also signs that she is committed to
promoting the representative in her city. Therefore, monitoring takes place
through different strategies that make it possible to distinguish brokers
and thus calibrate the resource distribution to different localities. As
other studies have pointed out (Szwarcberg, 2015; Gingerich, 2020), our
evidence shows the importance of learning in selecting brokers and
updating expectations about them.
