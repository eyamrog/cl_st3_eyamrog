A subjective emotional experience - also understood as feeling or
sensation - is the essence of an emotion, and its
objective manifestations is observed in its influences on behaviour or
by physiological signals from the body or brain are indirect
indicators of these internal experiences. As a consequence, the best
way to access these feelings is through verbal reports (LeDoux
& Hofmann, 2018). Measures of subjective states assessed through verbal
reports of the athletes, can describe psychological conditions (Bueno &
Souza, 2019).
