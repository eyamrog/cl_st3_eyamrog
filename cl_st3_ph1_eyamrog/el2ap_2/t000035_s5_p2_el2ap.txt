The findings of phase I in relation to the impact
of oral health on quality of life agree with the
assertion that edentulous individuals are physically disabled or incapacitated, due
to the difficulty they have in eating, speaking and in
social interactions23, aspects indicated by the respondents as the worst
problems arising from a lack of teeth. Of the total
number of patients, 68.4% mentioned difficulty eating and 63.2% reported
difficulty smiling as problems caused by missing teeth, showing the
impact of edentulism on their personal, social and emotional quality
of life23,24, which also includes speech and chewing impairments25, cited
by 31.6% and 26.3% of volunteers, respectively. Of the total
number of patients, 42.1% reported that they did not use
dentures for financial reasons, corroborating the fact that while prosthetic
rehabilitation is offered by the Brazilian National Health Service10, the
supply may be insufficient to meet demand, and a large
portion of the population do not have the resources to
acquire the same26 or do not have access to the
services offered by the public health system22, difficulties which also
affect the Patax√≥ indigenous people of Aldeia Velha.
