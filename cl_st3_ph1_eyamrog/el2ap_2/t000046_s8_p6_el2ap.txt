Regarding PE, Devide (2002, p.78) states that it has a
role to play because “[...] if we want our intervention
to be successful, we teachers must offer what will certainly
improve the quality of our recipients’ lives.” For Gouvêa and
Silva (2019), PE cannot be limited to encouraging the practice
of physical activities; it should also critically and reflexively approach
issues of access to leisure equipment and basic health care,
dialoguing with the benefits of these habits.
