Additionally, We use the H index to assess how well
a set of items represents a common factor – factor
stability – (Ferrando e Lorenzo-Seva 2018). H values range from
0 to 1, showing the latent variable strength across different
studies (High H values (> 0.80) suggest a well-defined latent
variable, low H values suggest an ill-defined latent variable) (Ferrando
e Lorenzo-Seva 2018).
