The study by Wray et al. (2017) sought to determine
whether children with language disorders use gestures to compensate for
their language difficulties. From the research, it was possible to
detect that the gesture and language form a communication system
closely linked, in which the deficits of gestures are seen
alongside difficulties with spoken communication.
