The interviewees tended to downplay the electionsâ€™ period importance to
establishing relationships with local brokers. They tended to say that
the work on municipalities, local groups, and voters is done
over the years and that use elections for publicizing actions
and channeled benefits. Despite this, one cannot to deny the
impacts caused by the electoral cycle on the dynamics of
these relationships. For example, representatives cannot channel amendments directly to
civil organizations during election years. Furthermore, an amendment approved in
a year may be executed in the following year, when
neither the author of the amendment nor the allied mayor
who demanded it may be in office anymore.
