This understanding of dialogue can be harnessed for discourse studies.
Appraisal Theory uses a dialogic perspective to analyse how language
“locate[s] the writer/speaker with respect to the value positions being
referenced in the text and with respect to, in Bakhtin’s
terms, the backdrop of alternative opinions, points of view and
value judgements against which all texts operate” (MARTIN & WHITE,
2005, p.94). The specific advantage of a Bakhtinian dialogic perspective
is that it lets us recognise the status of “bare
assertions”, or monoglossic talk, which does not overtly reference other
voices, recognise alternative positions or put competing discourses into contact
(BAXTER, 2011, p.127; MARTIN & WHITE, 2005, p.99). Monoglossic talk
appears as “a compact and indivisible mass […] fused with
its authority”, assuming taken-for- granted status so that one can
either wholly accept or reject it.
