Having displayed the focus of this study as being modes,
the nub of meaning production in multimodality, the analyst has
moreover explicated mode as the conceptual lens. This means that
mode is a framework for exploring modes in their various
forms. This locus is congruent to Halliday and Matthiessen’s (2009)
revelation where grammar becomes an item of illuminating grammar. Consequently,
SFL labels a situation where grammar turns to interpret itself,
as being grammatics; and also to Hall’s (1966) deduction of
proxemics from proximity. Could one then construct the theory of
modes, explaining itself as being Modics? Drawing on the insight,
as highlighted earlier that mode is systemic, attracting system network.
Figure 1 demonstrates the systematicity of mode below.
