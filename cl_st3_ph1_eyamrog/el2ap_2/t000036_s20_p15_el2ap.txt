Based on the data, it can be seen that wages
fluctuated in direct relation to the price index. That is,
until 1932, taking into account the deflationary phenomenon, real wages
increased because nominally they remained stable since 1929. After 1932,
when policies related to the gold standard are set aside,
inflation has a direct impact on wages: real wages decreased
while employment increased due to the growth of the money
supply, confirming the Phillips curve (Naranjo 2021). As can be
seen in figure 3, the growth of inflation stops in
1937, with which it can also be said that wages
begin to stabilize from the same year.
