The evidence in this section suggests that principal-agent theories are
insufficient to characterize the relationship dynamics between state representatives and
their local brokers. The risks that characterize these relationships do
not arise from an inherent conflict between the participantsâ€™ goals
or from informational asymmetry in favor of the agents. Our
data shows a good deal of continuity between the goals
of local brokers and representatives, namely to ensure their success
in the next round of elections by offering resources and
benefits valued by the local population and by meeting private
requests. Moreover, if politicians recruit brokers based on their upward
ties with party elites, as pointed out by Brierley and
Nathan (2021) and suggested by our evidence, we should expect
smaller risks of defection and opportunistic behavior. If, as we
have also seen, participants in these relationships play dual roles,
both face problems of commitment and informational asymmetry. Although both
have exit options (Novaes, 2018), they also face obstacles in
following this alternative. Ideally, it would be rational for legislators
to expand their local networks by adding mayors and councilors
continuously, as well as for mayors to seek more profitable
partnerships. However, this implies costs, sometimes prohibitive, as highlighted by
Hicken and Nathan (2020) and evidenced by our interviews. These
are some reasons as to why goals between these actors
are kept aligned.
