From the beginning, one of its objectives was the preservation
of springs and water sources in the metropolitan region of
São Paulo through the Capivari and Embu Guaçu rivers, and
in Itanhaém, the Mambu/Rio Branco system. In relation to ecosystem
services, the Núcleo contributes in several aspects, such as regulation
of air and climate quality, in the protection of hills,
slopes and soils, in the preservation of biodiversity, among other
attributions (PESM 2021a, b).
