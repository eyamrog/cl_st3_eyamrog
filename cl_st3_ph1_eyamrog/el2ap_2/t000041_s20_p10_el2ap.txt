Furthermore, in this floristic survey, herbs are the predominant habit
(108 spp.), which differs from other plant surveys (Silva et
al. 2015, Gadelha-Neto et al. 2018) that have woody plants
as the predominant habit. Several factors may indicate why this
habit prevailed: the environment may be favorable, which favors the
number of species or it may be due to the
scarcity of collections focused on the herbaceous stratum in other
studies with similar environments.
