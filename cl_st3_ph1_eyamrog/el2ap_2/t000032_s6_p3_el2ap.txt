Factor VII (Interest) seems to be a Factor present about
40 minutes before the match, as also shown by Bueno
and Di Bonifácio (2007), Dias-Silva (2013), Di Bonifácio (2013) and
Silva (2013). Factor VII (Interest) can be considered related to
organic activation and motivation. Pujals and Vieira (2002) reported that
a specific interest (improving performance) is present in young soccer
athletes, which is a motivational Factor linked to the need
of achievement (Brunstein & Heckhausen, 2018) and to intrinsic and
extrinsic motivation (Brunstein, 2018). Gea Garcia et al. (2016) showed
that the temporal proximity of competitive matches causes an increased
intensity of Vigor and Tension (POMS Factors) in college athletes.
In the current study, the highest presence values of Factor
XII (Serenity) were detected temporally more distant from the matches.
It is important to note that the level of competition
and the age range are different between these studies and
an investigation of the influence of these aspects to the
presence of this Factor will be relevant.
