To conclude, returning to the research question of this paper,
"What is the contribution of gestures (non-verbal communication) in the
teaching and learning process?" we can definitively say that gestures
present themselves as a very important factor that contributes to
the teaching and learning process, that they can’t be overlooked
and its analysis should be integrated into the teacher training
curriculum. Therefore, not only the field of research in Education,
but also the practice of education both in formal and
non-formal spaces, should consider non-verbal communication, and specially gestures –
that try to depict a certain thought in the minds
of teachers or apprentices – as important and relevant as
speech and new research should be done to set the
limits and possibilities of addressing this important channel of communication
between humans.
