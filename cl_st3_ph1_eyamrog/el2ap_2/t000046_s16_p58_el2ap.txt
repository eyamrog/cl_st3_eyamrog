In the category “Body practices,” the influence of a traditional
PE is clear. This category suggests that health is achieved
by means of a pedagogical practice focused on physical exercise,
either by systematical or by playful sport activities (with games),
as previously affirmed by Devide (1996). This discourse, justified by
the development of biological variables and motor learning, ends up
relating, sometimes implicitly, fitness to the achievement of a health
index. This perspective guided, and still guides, much of the
pedagogical practices of physical education teachers (BRACHT, 2013; OLIVEIRA; MARTINS;
BRACHT, 2015a).
