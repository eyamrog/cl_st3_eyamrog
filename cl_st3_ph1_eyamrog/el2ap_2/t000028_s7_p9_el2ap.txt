Although the legislation has advanced throughout the years, nationally and
internationally, attitudes of segregation are unfortunately still present in our
society, due to poor accessibility, stereotypical thoughts, lack of educational
and professional opportunities and inadequacy of legislation, for example (GARC√çA,
2014). Inclusive perspectives and efforts are necessary to help ensure
there are more tolerant and egalitarian communities, with equal opportunities
to all citizens.
