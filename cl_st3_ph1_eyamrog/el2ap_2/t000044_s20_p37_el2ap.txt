The gesture can be well used in educational environments and,
according to Goldin- Meadow (2017), it can exist in at
least three ways. The first would be for teachers to
examine their gestures to ensure that they are not conveying
ideas that might mislead students. Teachers can even think about
how the ideas they want to teach can be displayed
in their hands and then consciously produce these gestures during
classes.
