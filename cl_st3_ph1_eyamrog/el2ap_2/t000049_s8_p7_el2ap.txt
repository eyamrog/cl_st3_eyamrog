The research is carried out on an explorative basis and
aimed at acknowledging and analyzing the best contexts – space,
time, educational approaches – to encourage and promote the development
of scientific thought in kindergarten. The initial project, monitored by
a team of researchers and supervisors, underwent slight modifications due
to findings that emerged during the observation of the children
and the revision of the documents collected during the process.
The final considerations regarding the experience contemplate the children’s progress
in the scientific field. This progress is closely connected with
the contexts in which it was analyzed – tools, time,
educational approaches –, intentionally chosen by adults, documented, monitored, and
evaluated from different points of view to offer the best
experience not only for the children but also for the
teachers and families.
