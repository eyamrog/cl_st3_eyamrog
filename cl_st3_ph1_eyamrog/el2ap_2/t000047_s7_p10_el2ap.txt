In multimodal discourses, the mode is a semiotic channel of
both artistic and scientific expressions. The artistic feature stems from
a particular background, enabling a sign-maker to construct meaning for
the audience in focus. The scientific quality anchors on the
influences of people on an artifact deployed as a mode.
Besides, the analytical characteristic worth of an analyst on its
materiality projects a mode as being scientific. There are little
doubts that a mode has a material human endowment, its
conceptual appearance is heuristic, using the media to prompt its
embodied contextual meanings. In Constantinouâ€™s (2005) point of view, this
communicative scheme is not only a mechanism of meaning realization;
the device is also an abstract resource of semiosis (Fei,
2004). That understanding appears to motivate Norris (2011) to suggest
that modes are unavoidably construed as distinct entities. That uniqueness
reminds readers and scholars that every meaning-maker employs a mode
or a cluster of modes to communicate ideas from one
territory to another. Such a measure positions a mode as
an inevitable substance of communication. The mode, being a distinct
subject matter, points to two perspectives. One, different modes in
a semiotic system contribute prominently to meaning-making to readers. Two,
each mode generates clearly noticeable meaning in different contextual domains.
