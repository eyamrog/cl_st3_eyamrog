promotion from within (Bondioli, 2008; Bondioli, Savio, 2009; Bondioli, 2015a
e Savio, 2003; Bondioli, Savio, 2012; Savio, 2013). The adult
intervenes by promoting and favoring the explorative action, following the
‘promotion from within’ model. In this scenario, the teacher waits
for and welcomes the child’s initiative, encourages questions, and ‘reflects’
the scientific attitude manifested by the children in relation to
the materials, either verbally or non-verbally. He also expands the
children’s initiatives by ‘showing how it is done’, and elaborates
and amplifies their explorative and inventive efforts. The above- cited
aspects define the participative attitude of this approach, which is
concerned with the child’s interests and entitles him to participate
actively in the learning process. This approach aims to investigate
if and to what extent the intervention of an adult
who wants to stimulate the child’s interests and curiosity, without
controlling his ideas, can influence the manifestation of scientific attitudes.
