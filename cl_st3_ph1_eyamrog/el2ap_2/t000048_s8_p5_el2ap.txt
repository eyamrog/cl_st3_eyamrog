The present work is part of the Flora study of
the Núcleo Curucutu, important region, but little- known, even though
being a part of São Paulo City (Garcia & Pirani
2005), carried out in partnership with the Universidade Santo Amaro
and the Herbarium PMSP. For monocots, works with Iridaceae (Takeuchi
et al. 2008) and Orchidaceae (Rosa & Affonso 2009) were
also developed in the area.
