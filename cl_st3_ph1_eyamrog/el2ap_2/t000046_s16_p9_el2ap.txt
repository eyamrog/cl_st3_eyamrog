In addition, Umemura and Rosa (2020, p.81) emphasize that “[...]
teachers have been treated as executors and managers as supervisors
of policies established by the central bodies of public administration.”
These characteristics had already been related by Fernandes (2012), who
found the realization of the dissemination of government proposals and
elaboration of projects in a bibliographic survey of the activities
performed by coordinating teachers, besides being responsible for the levels
of performance in external evaluations.
