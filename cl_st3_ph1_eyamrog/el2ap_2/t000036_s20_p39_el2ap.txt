The countries that are reviewed and analyzed below went through
their own local and national political contexts, however, all point
to the creation of minimum wage barriers that allow workers
to have an income as a minimum necessary sustenance. For
this, the situation of workers in the public sector, geographical
differences and transportation problems in specific localities, labor demand in
private sectors, and the possibility of employers making these payments
were taken into account. Thus, it can be understood how
several countries legalized different types of minimum wages depending on
the geographical position, the exchange rate and the type of
work. The Latin American region was witnessing, in the 1930s,
a wave of implementation of minimum wages, either through legal
bodies or through constitutional changes. In the constitutions of Brazil,
Mexico, Uruguay and Peru were clear the need to establish
constant minimum wages (Owen 1938). The rest of the countries
in the region welcomed them over time and within their
own political context.
