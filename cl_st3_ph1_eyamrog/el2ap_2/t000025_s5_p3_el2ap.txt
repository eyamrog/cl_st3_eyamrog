We reviewed 70 studies that explored 20 topical therapies such
as dressings with different mechanisms of action, analgesic drugs, and
antimicrobial substances, among others, with promising results to mitigate pain.
However, only 31.4% of the studies applied standardized pain assessment
tools: Visual Analogue Scale, Numerical Verbal Scale, McGill's Questionnaire, and
the assessment by categories (no pain, weak, moderate, and severe).
In addition, in a survey evaluating attitudes and knowledge about
pain assessment and treatment among health care providers, demonstrated that
nurses possessed a lower level of knowledge about pain assessment
and management (Nuseir et al., 2016).
