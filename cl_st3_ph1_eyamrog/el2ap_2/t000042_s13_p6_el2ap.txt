In early August, when Brazil reached three million infections and
100,000 deaths, ABRASCO, Oxfam Brazil Office and leaders of the
National Health System (known by its Portuguese acronym SUS) accused
the government of criminal actions and began to use the
term necropolitics.21 Prior to the COVID crisis, the concept of
necropolitics was used in studies documenting police abuse in favelas
and mass incarcerations of Afro-Brazilians in the so-called "war on
drugs." The Bolsonaro administration selectively decided who should pay for
the consequences of the pandemic and forced the countryâ€™s poor
to choose between hunger (if isolating) and exposure to contamination
(if working unprotected). 22
