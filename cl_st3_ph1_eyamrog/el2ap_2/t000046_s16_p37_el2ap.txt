Finally, in the category “Good habits,” teacher Carlos points out
the risk behaviors that surround students, suggesting another path by
means of physical activities. This statement is elucidated by teacher
Daniela in her life narrative, showing the habits she had
and the adoption by her whole family. In this sense,
we can correlate it with Devide (1996; 2002), regarding the
propagation of habits, but we cannot rule out other variables
that allow it, such as the socioeconomic variables.
