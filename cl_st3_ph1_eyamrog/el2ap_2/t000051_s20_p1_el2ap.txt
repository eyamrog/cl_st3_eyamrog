The speech has seven parts: an introduction, followed by the
five “courses of action” that Scholz proposes, and a final
part. In the original text, Scholz says “Fünf Handlungsaufträge liegen
nun vor uns”, which can be translated as ‘five mandates
of action now lie ahead of us’ and suggests a
certain passivity, an imposition of these mandates by someone else,
perhaps a higher force such as moral obligation or time,
given that in the previous sentence Scholz identifies a challenge
“vor die die Zeit uns gestellt hat” (‘that time has
brought us up against’). This constructed passive reactivity disappears in
the official translation, which has “there are five courses of
action that we must take” and “the challenge that now
faces us”, where time disappears as an actor.
