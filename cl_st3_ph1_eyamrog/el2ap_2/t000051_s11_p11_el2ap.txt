This understanding is a considerable strength over other approaches to
discourse studies. Too many critical discourse approaches hold a view
of ideology whereby there is some “ideal order that is
distorted, disordered, or perverted by the operations of power” in
the form of corrupting ideologies, and which assumes that Critical
Discourse Analysis can “discern truth from falsehood with discourse analytic
tools” (PENNYCOOK, 2021, p.106). Such Structuralist or neo-Marxist approaches “where
ideology (falsehood) is infused with power (a result of dominant
views of the world) and truth sits outside such power
(the revelations of the analyst)” (PENNYCOOK, 2021, p.112) can lead
to “a patronising principle that people are ideological dupes from
whose eyes the clear-sighted analyst can remove the blindfolds of
ideological obfuscation” (PENNYCOOK, 2021, p.107).
