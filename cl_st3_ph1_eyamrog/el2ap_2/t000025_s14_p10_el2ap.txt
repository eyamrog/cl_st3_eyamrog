Any study with a qualitative theoretical and methodological framework was
considered for qualitative studies. Any experimental (controlled trials with or
without randomization, quasi- experimental, before and after) and observational studies
(descriptive, cohort, cross-sectional, case, and case series) were considered for
quantitative studies. Systematic, non-systematic, meta- analyzes, meta-synthesis, and clinical practice
guidelines were considered. In addition, unpublished studies (gray literature) in
English, Portuguese, and Spanish without time limits were also considered.
