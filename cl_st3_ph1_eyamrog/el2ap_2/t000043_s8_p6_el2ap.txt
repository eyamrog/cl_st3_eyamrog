The main advantage of SCCS is that time invariant confounders
that act on the standard rates are rigorously controlled. These
factors are like: sex, location, genetics, socio economic factors and
underlying health condition (1,5,12). It is also cheaper and easier
to collect data since the design only requires cases with
the event of interest. Also, as an advantage is the
methodological efficiency compared to the cohort design, for example, in
the surveillance of adverse events after vaccination, a traditional cohort
study may not be applicable for full coverage of the
effects since it would be a challenge to recruit unvaccinated
controls as the surveillance systems normally collect data on individuals
who reported an adverse event. The SCCS requires a small
sample of the population to be studied thus it can
produce results that are clinically and statistically valid from just
a few cases (1,4). Some of the limitations of the
SCCS design include: it does not produce estimates of absolute
incidence but only estimates of relative incidence; as one of
its assumptions, it requires that the probability of exposure is
not affected by the occurrence of an outcome event, the
effect of exposure has to be transient, variations over time
are not adjusted for, it is prone to selection and
information bias (normally uses information from surveillance databases). For non-recurrent
events, the SCCS design works only when the event risk
is small over the observation period (1,12)
