Table 3 shows the results of the descriptive analysis of
the attributed scores of all patients after one year of
using the dentures (t1), which were generally high. One patient
scored zero for chewing and the stability and comfort of
the lower dentures. The attributed scores for chewing, aesthetics and
hygiene were significantly lower for lower dentures (p<0.05).
