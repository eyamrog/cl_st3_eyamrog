While it is recommended that edentulism is treated in Primary
Care, this treatment has been commonly performed in specialized care,
through the installation of removable complete dentures, the manufacturing processes
of which comprise five sessions involving clinical procedures, followed by
laboratory procedures. Such techniques for the manufacture of complete dentures,
spread over five sessions, are also recommended by the Ministry
of Health, through a manual entitled Oral Health in the
National Health Service10, and must be carried out in Basic
Health Units or in Specialist Dental Centers, according to the
organization of the municipal region.
