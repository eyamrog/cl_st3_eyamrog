Some elements such as the chance of classification and the
outcome of matches (defeat in particular) influenced the way the
Present Mood States changed during the present study period. It
was perceived by changes in the presence of PMSL Factors
showing the increased intensity of the locutions involving Present Mood
States of negative hedonic value such as “I am angry”,
“I am sad”, “I feel humiliated” and “I feel ashamed”
after the matches and by the reduction of presence values
of Factors III (Hope) and VII (Interest) at the end
of the study period, since the team no longer had
any chance of classification. Studies report that defeat elicits negative
emotions and reduces positive emotions among the athletes after a
competition (Ahmadi et al., 2015; Lewis et al., 2017; Rubio,
2006) and that the intensity of negative mood states changes
as the competition progresses (Bueno & Di Bonifácio, 2007). Further
studies may confirm how other results (a tie and winning)
will influence the presence of specific Present Mood States and
their changes along a competititive period.
