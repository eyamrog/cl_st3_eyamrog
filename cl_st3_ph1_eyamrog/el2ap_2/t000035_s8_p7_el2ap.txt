Based on the complexity of conventional techniques for making dentures,
which involves five clinical and laboratory sessions, assisting indigenous villagers
with their dentures needs is extremely difficult. It is therefore
essential that simplified techniques of prosthetic rehabilitation, which have been
found to be effective, are used for the oral rehabilitation
of this population. Randomized, controlled and blind studies have shown
that simplified techniques are capable of producing comparable results to
traditional denture-making techniques, based on both patient satisfaction and the
quality of the dentures13,14. The simplified technique has a lower
cost and shorter clinical/laboratory period and is able to restore
masticatory function to a level comparable to the conventional protocol,
as well as improving oral health related quality of life15,16,17.
