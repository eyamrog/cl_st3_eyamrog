2. Assembly and construction. The behaviours that have been considered
concern situations in which the children, individually and / or
in groups, look for objects with the intention of building
something on the basis of a project, a goal that
they achieve without meeting particular "hitches". Some examples are represented
by the construction of a marble track and the assembly
of different materials to create a wigwam.
