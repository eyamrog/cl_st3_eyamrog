Data related to satisfaction and masticatory ability were assessed using
a questionnaire and visual analog scale. The analysis of satisfaction
considered: general satisfaction, masticatory ability, stability, aesthetics, phonetics, comfort and
ease of cleaning. Masticatory ability was assessed by the patient's
self-perception of chewing the following foods: bread, cheese, meat, apples,
coconut, carrots, tomatoes and lettuce. Another semi-structured interview was carried
out, aiming to highlight the degree of patient satisfaction with
the dentures, and the benefits generated (or not) from their
use.
