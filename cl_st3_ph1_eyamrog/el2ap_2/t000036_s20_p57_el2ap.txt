The Superior Labor Council began to discuss a proposal for
a bill on the minimum wage, which was approved in
March 1935 to be presented to the national congress. The
bill contemplated a minimum daily income that should not be
less than two-thirds nor more than three-fourths of the normal
or currently paid salary in each area of the country.
