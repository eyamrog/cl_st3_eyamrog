This is a very important municipality for us. The mayor
is not 100% ours. She is in her second term,
and she is going to support a great leader of
the municipality who is from her group, very dear to
the town. She is not even affiliated with [the legislator's
party], but she is already committed to [the legislator]. One
year in advance we start planning for the following year.
Of course, everything can change during the elections, but we
are betting on it and allocating resources to it. The
mayor, being a good friend of her’s and ours’, although
already committed to another legislator, opened the doors of the
municipality (Councilor 1).
