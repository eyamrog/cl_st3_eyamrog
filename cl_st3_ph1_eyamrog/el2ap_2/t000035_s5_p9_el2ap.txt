Of the total number of patients, 52.6% expected to chew
better after the dentures were made. With the scores attributed
in the final interview for chewing ability (a mean of
9.9±0.5 for the complete upper dentures and a mean of
8.4±3.2 for the complete lower dentures), in addition to the
scores for chewing the different types of foods, it can
be affirmed that the dentures made by the proposed technique
have the ability to restore chewing function to the same
degree as was previously found with the conventional dentures15.
