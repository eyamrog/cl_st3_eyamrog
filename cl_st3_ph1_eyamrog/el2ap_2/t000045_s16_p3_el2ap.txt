Rather than deriving assumptions about the actors’ motivations and the
alliances’ expected outcome from theory, the interviews gives us a
more comprehensive view of these processes and its unfolding over
time. They enable us to identify the elements that underlie
the quantitative evidence in the literature and illustrate their operating
mechanisms (Martin, 2013). These elements refer to the perceptions and
motivations of actors directly involved in constructing these alliances, which
are hardly captured through surveys. Thus, to the extent that
the interviews provide a more detailed description of how actors
make choices, act, and react in their mutual relations, they
can contribute to generating hypotheses and/or propose causal mechanisms (Martin,
2013; Kapiszewski, MacLean, and Read, 2015).
