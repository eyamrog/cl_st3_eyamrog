It is obvious that linguistic as well as communication studies
have some ways of realizing meaning. That logic informs multimodality
to rest its meaning-making on the choice and construction of
modes. As a result, Page (2010) argues that a mode
is an entity of making sense of the material world,
characteristically demonstrating some statuses of generating meaning potentials. These states
of affairs are varied, depending sometimes strictly on the background
of the audience, the kind of meaning to be made,
and the subject that the modes intend to represent (Herman,
2010). Building on that position, one might acknowledge that the
mode could be a fluid entity and at the same
time being open-ended. As a mode is realized through a
medium, it projects different meanings in different media settings. That
could stimulate the researcher to consider this meaning-making object as
being parasitic because it relies on another situation for meaning
determination.
