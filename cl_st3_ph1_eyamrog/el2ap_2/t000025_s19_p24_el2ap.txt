In four studies (5%), topical cryotherapy was applied to control
MFW-related pain without this being the primary focus, but rather
the management of symptoms which included pain. The studies were
non-systematic reviews (50%), surveys (25%), and guidelines (25%). The studies
did not show the forms of use or results.
