The relationship between these participants is maintained as long as
they are mutually beneficial. Some authors argue that the risk
of brokers’ disloyalty is higher in contexts of non- dominant
clientelist parties in which none of them has exclusive access
to state resources (Muñoz, 2014; Novaes, 2018). According to Aspinall
(2014), in such a scenario, the chances of defection and
predatory behavior increase as brokers seeking short-term material rewards predominate
in the network. Other factors explaining brokers’ loyalty are the
volume of candidates’ resources and their prospects for victory (Aspinall,
2014), levels of party identification among voters, and the existence
of programmatic linkages between brokers and bosses (Novaes, 2018).
