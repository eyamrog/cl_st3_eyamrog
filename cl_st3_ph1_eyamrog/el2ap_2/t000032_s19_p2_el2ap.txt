Comparison of the presence values of each Factor of a
same Series between Events revealed changes in mood states as
a function of time course (Figure 1). Temporal patterns of
changes in mood states were detected, represented by Factors II
(Fatigue), VII (Interest) and XII (Serenity). Factor II (Fatigue) presence
values were higher for TR-PRE than for MATCH (p=0.001) and
MATCH values were also lower than TR-POST values (p=0.002). For
Factor VII (Interest) presence values, TR-PRE values were higher than
TR-POST values (p=0.008) and MATCH values were also higher than
TR-POST values (p=0.000). For Factor XII (Serenity), TR-PRE values were
higher than TR-POST values in Series 1 (p= 0.023) and
3 (p=0.023), but were lower than TR-POST values in Series
2 (p=0.034). Thus, TR-PRE values were higher for Factor II
(Fatigue) compared to MATCH values and MATCH values were higher
for Factors VII (Interest) and XII (Serenity) compared to TR-POST
values. TR-POST values of Factor II (Fatigue) were higher than
MATCH values.
