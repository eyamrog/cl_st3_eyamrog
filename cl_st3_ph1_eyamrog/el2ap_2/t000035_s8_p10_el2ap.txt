The second pillar is the application of a simplified technique,
involving making and installing the parts of the dentures on
the same day. In the morning, patients undergo the taking
of anatomical and functional impressions, intermaxillary registration, and assembly and
testing of the arches. In the afternoon, the laboratory processing
stages are carried out, which include muffle inclusion, acrylization of
the thermally activated acrylic resin in the microwave, and finishing
and polishing, so that at the end of the day,
patients receive the complete conventional dentures.
