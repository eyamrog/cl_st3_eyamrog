Among the interviewees, the selection of brokers seems to follow
a more regional criterion and may occur through different paths
and in a very informal way. In the case of
mayors, for example, an alliance can start with the mayor’s
initiative to reach out to a legislator, making a request
and proposing a partnership. This occurs, for example, with “orphan
mayors” who are “without a legislator” (“sem deputado”) due to
a broken relationship or because the candidate who the mayor
supported failed to get elected. Mayors from the same region
and adjacent municipalities speak to each other: a mayor recommends
a legislator to another, or an orphan mayor seeks information
with a mayor from a neighboring municipality. Some interviewees said
that when a new mayor approaches them, they seek information
about her, sometimes from their former allies, which shows the
importance of reputation in building alliances and suggests a kind
of ex-ante control at the early stages of a relationship.
