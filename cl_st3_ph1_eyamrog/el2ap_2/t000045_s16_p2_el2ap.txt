To identify broader trends in the relationships between state legislators
and their brokers, we use data from the two waves
of a survey undertaken by the Center for Legislative Studies
(CEL/DCP/UFMG) in twelve Brazilian states4 with 513 state representatives in
2007 and 439 in 20125. This data helps us reflect
on what to expect from qualitative evidence. Although not nationwide
(not generalizable to the whole country), it allows us to
draw a broader picture for Brazil. In addition, we conducted
ten in-depth interviews with chiefs of staff and advisors of
nine state legislators from a single state. The interviews provide
new evidence to the same research questions highlighted at the
beginning of this section and which are also answered using
quantitative data.
