Özçalışkan, Adamson, Dimitrova, and Baumann (2018) showed in their research
that children and parents produce similar types of gestures and
gesture-speech combinations. That is, when researching children with autism spectrum
disorder (ASD) or Down syndrome (DS), they observed the specific
differences in diagnosis concerning children with typical development (TD) in
the production of gestures. However, only the children - but
not the parents - showed specific variability of the diagnosis
in the frequency with which they produced each type of
gesture and gesture-speech combination.
