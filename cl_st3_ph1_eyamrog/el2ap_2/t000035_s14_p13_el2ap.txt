The objective was to offer a dental dentures service. During
the joint venture, the team of dentists from DSEI Bahia,
with the support of two prosthetic technicians and the supervision
of professors from Faculdade São Leopoldo Mandic, made dental dentures
for the Pataxó, and twenty edentulous patients were rehabilitated using
complete dentures. The dentures received by the patients in the
task force were made of pressed thermally activated acrylic resin.
