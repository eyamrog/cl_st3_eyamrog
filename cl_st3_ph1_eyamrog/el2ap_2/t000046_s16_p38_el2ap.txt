In short, teachers’ and coordinators’ understanding of health varied from
a broad to a more restricted perspective, showing that the
theme is subject to several appropriations. In a broad perspective,
the understanding of health considers social determinants and has scope
beyond a disease itself. In the restricted perspective, in turn,
health is limited to the physical dimension or to the
fact that they are not sick or need medicines, as
well as to the WHO concept of complete physical, psychological
and social well-being.
