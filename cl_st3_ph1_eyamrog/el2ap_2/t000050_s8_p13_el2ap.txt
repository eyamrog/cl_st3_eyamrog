Our dataset is comprised of sand fly records that resulted
from the activities of a project aimed to evaluate the
main risk factors for the disease, using an interdisciplinary approach.
In 2012, there was an outbreak of leishmaniasis in the
WIL affecting more than 20 people in 7 different villages
[17]. This outbreak triggered a broader investigation that was conducted
between 2012-2015 in order to understand the causal processes related
to the local epidemiological context, to propose measures to prevent
and control the disease among the Wajãpi. The investigation unfolded
in a multi-institutional project with the partnership of institutions related
to health services, such as: Distrito Sanitário Especial Indígena (DSEI)
Amapá e Norte do Pará, Secretaria Municipal de Saúde de
Pedra Branca do Amapari, Coordenadoria de Vigilância em Saúde do
Amapá, Laboratório Central de Saúde Pública do Amapá, Instituto René
Rachou (Fiocruz-MG), Universidade Federal do Amapá, Universidade de São Paulo,
and Universidade Federal do Oeste do Pará. Teams with different
expertise were formed: entomologists, biologists, veterinarians, laboratory technicians, anthropologists, epidemiologists,
nurses, etc.
