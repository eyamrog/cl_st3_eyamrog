In the case of Bolivia, on June 27, 1933, the
decree was published by means of which the increase in
wages was legalized in both the public and private sectors.
These salaries increased percentage- wise, depending on the productive sectors
and monthly income: those workers with a salary higher than
1,201 bolivianos per month, the salary increased by 780 bolivianos;
those workers with less than 100 bolivianos per month, the
salary increased by 120%; those workers with a daily salary
of one boliviano, the increase was 120%; and, those domestic
workers who received up to five bolivianos per day, the
increase was 80% (Owen 1938).
