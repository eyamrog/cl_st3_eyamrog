The last line expresses the uncertain nature of some alliances
and the fact that legislators are often making a risky
bet, an aspect also registered by Bezerra (1999). Therefore, our
evidence suggests that partnerships between representatives and local brokers may
suffer from adverse selection problems similar to those that characterize
principal-agent relationships. The participantsâ€™ information gathering, learning, and reputation are
essential elements guiding the choice of partners (Gingerich, 2020). However,
it is not only those who play the role of
bosses who are subject to these risks. Local brokers also
take the initiative to form partnerships and seek information to
increase the odds of a fruitful alliance.
