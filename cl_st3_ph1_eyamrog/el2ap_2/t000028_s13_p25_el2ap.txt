Other methods can also be explored to avoid problems of
segregation in class. Camargo and Nardi (2006) researched on the
lack of inclusion of blind students in Physics classes, aiming
to introduce that issue to undergraduate teachers and to identify
possible solutions to the problem. Their investigation was guided from
a preparatory and a practical moment, in which future Physics
teachers could build a course with activities aimed at both
35 sighted and two non-sighted students. Given this circumstance, the
undergraduate students faced difficulties in finding methods that do not
rely on visual resources, since many teachers of Physics mostly
use the blackboard and visual experiments. Aiming to increase the
inclusion of blind students in class, and to find solutions
for that problem, the undergraduates presented Physics activities involving complementary
and collaborative roles, such as oral exposition, reading and discussion
in groups and even plays (CAMARGO; NARDI, 2006).
