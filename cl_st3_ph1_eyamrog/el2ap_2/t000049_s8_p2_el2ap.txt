In particular, scientific education is defined as the promotion of
critical and reflective thinking, and it is focused on the
development of knowledge relating to things that are animated and

Dewey, through the uncovering and highlighting of issues. In this
type of process, it is essential to observe and bring
forward hypotheses, solutions, and their verification.
