Despite overcoming a strict paradigm of physical fitness, PE is
still understood as a curricular component of basic education. Concerning
health, PE requires efforts to meet critical pedagogies. In this
sense, we believe that the critical absorption of the BNCC
by the area, according to the numerous studies that has
focused on the theme, will eventually envision a PE aligned
with the cultural formation of human beings. Thus, health can
be debated at the collective level based on its determinants
and that the body culture, in its manifestations around games,
gymnastics, sport, dance, fights, as a basis of a pedagogical
practice in PE committed to social transformation. In short, a
practice that combats the pressures of the contemporary world, which
in the field of PE lives of the precept “Physical
activity is health.”
