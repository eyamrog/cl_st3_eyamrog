Analyzing partnerships between representatives and mayors, Samuels (2002) stressed the
risk of credit capture by mayors who are responsible for
implementing the amendments directed to municipalities. In order to minimize
this problem representatives could prioritize amendments for municipalities administered by
fellow party members (Bai√£o and Couto, 2017) or create alternative
direct communication channels with the population.
