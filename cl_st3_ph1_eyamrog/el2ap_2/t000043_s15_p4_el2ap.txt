For the overall/composite assessment in each section, stars are allocated.
For section 1, a maximum of three stars can be
awarded to a study if the cases are representatives of
the cases in the general population like in the case
of vaccine safety studies, if there is a clear ascertainment
of the exposure of interest and if there is a
demonstration that the outcome of interest occurred in the observation
period. In section 2, a maximum of two stars can
be awarded to a study if it reports that time
varying confounders were accounted for or if the follow up
period was short enough to mitigate time-confounding factors. In section
3, a study can be awarded a maximum of five
stars if there is a clear way of confirming the
outcome, if the risk and control periods are well stated,
if the time in the risk and control periods was
long enough for the outcome of interest to be analyzed
and if there was complete follow up of the cases
or accountability of the cases lost during follow up. In
total, a study can be awarded a maximum of 10
stars.
