According to Eichengreen & Temin (2000), the Great Depression produced
two phenomena on the prices of goods and products in
those countries that maintained the gold standard. First, a deflationary
phenomenon due to the reduction in the money supply (Drinot
& Knight 2014). Deflation forced industries to reduce production costs,
be these from the reduction of wages or from the
reduction in the number of workers (Arnaut 2010). This phenomenon
stopped when the countries eliminated the restrictions of the gold
standard, in the case of Ecuador it happened in 1932.
From then on, a second tendency was visualized, this time
inflationary because the countries found no legal restrictions for the
emission of new currency.
