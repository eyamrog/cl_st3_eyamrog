Although the majority of people with visual impairment or blindness
are over the age of 50 (BLINDNESS AND VISION IMPAIRMENT,
2021), we cannot disregard the younger masses who live in
the same conditions and do not receive assistance, especially when
it comes to blind children attending school. Based on these
data, we decided that the target audience for the didactic
adaptation proposal would be students with blindness, which is the
last stage of visual impairment. By addressing these audience, such
an adaptation may be used for students of all visual
levels.
