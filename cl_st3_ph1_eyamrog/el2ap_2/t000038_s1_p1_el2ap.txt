We conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to empirically derive
the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) factor structure. Data (peri-traumatic
stress during the COVID-19). We used data from the Physical
and Psychological Reactions as Health Indicators Research (Virtual Laboratory of
Affective, Cognitive and Behavioral Neuropsychometry â€“ LAVINACC). EFA was implemented
using a Polychoric Matrix and Robust Diagonally Weighted Least Squares
(RDWLS) extraction method. We used the Parallel Analysis with random
permutation, and as a rotation technique, we used the Robust
Promin. The adequacy of the model was evaluated using the
Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI),
and Comparative Fit Index (CFI) fit indices. The Ratio Communality
Index (RCI) reported (RCI = 0.998452) showed both subsamples have
a similar amount of common variance. Results showed adequacy of
the polychoric correlation matrix measured by Bartlett's sphericity (21116.6, (df
= 276; p < 0.00001) and KMO = 0.939. The
overall assessment (UniCo = 0.918; ECV = 0.85), MIREAL =
0.200), suggested that CPDI can be treated as a two-factor
structure: first factor (internal stressors), second factor (external stressors). Replication
studies to verify further validity and reliability should be undertaken.
