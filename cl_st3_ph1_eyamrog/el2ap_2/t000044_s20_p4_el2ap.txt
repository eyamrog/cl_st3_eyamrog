After the initial, pre-defined categories of analysis were made (categorized
by year, school level, etc) a second categorization was made.
To understand the contribution of gestures to the teaching and
learning process, we aimed to group the articles found in
the literature review into categories that would be meaningful to
answering our research question. These categories naturally emerged after reading
the articles and considering their similarities and their contributions to
the teaching and learning process.
