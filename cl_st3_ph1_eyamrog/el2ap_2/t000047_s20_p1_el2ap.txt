The video of New Oral-B® toothpaste (henceforth: Oral-B) advertising, examined
in this study, is an illustration of human and material
actions mediated in higher-level and lower- level terms. The modes,
of course, operational in copresence enable such actions in certain
environments. The modes, because of their different affordances, range from
animate to inanimate materiality. Following the modes’ theoretical scheme in
Figure 1, the concepts of written modes (Halliday & Matthiessen,
2014; Dalamu, 2018b), images (Kress & van Leeuwen, 2021; Baldry
& Thibault, 2010), proxemics (Norris, 2019), and gestures (Kendon, 2015)
are explore-able domains of this investigation. Thus, the discussion follows
the sectional pattern of the presentation of modes, demonstrated in
terms of HLMA 1, HLMA 2, HLMA 3, and HLMA
4. The entire time of this ad is just 30
seconds.
