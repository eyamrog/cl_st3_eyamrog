Based on Silva, Silva and Lüdorf’s (2015) perspective, body valorization
is manifested in contemporaneity, mainly due to health and aesthetics,
permeated by media exposure. In this sense, teacher Larissa’s speech
shows that this triad can lead to a risky behavior.
According to Silva et al. (2017), media influence ends up
reflecting on individual’s habits and social relationships, which may either
positively or negatively influence young people. Thus, it is possible
to imbue significant traces of an expanded conception of health,
acting on the behaviors of individuals; these individuals, in turn,
may have actions that lead some health problems.
