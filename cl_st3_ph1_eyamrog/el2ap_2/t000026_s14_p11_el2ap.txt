Then, Fisher's exact test was performed in quadratic tables (rows
and columns have the same number) and Pearson's chi-square test
(Ï‡2) in nonsquare tables (number of rows and columns differ),
both aiming to evaluate the data distribution of the variables
in relation to the symptomatic levels of anxiety through the
scores of the IDATEs (IDATE-T and IDATE-E).
