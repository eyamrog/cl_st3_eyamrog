We did not restrict our analysis to the electoral period,
and, like other scholars, we try to highlight the importance
of non-electoral tasks performed by brokers (Auyero, 2000; Zarazaga, 2014;
Hoyler, Gelape, and Silotto, 2021). They involve carrying out public
works, implementing public policies, communicating local demands to the state
government, and solving votersâ€™ individual and collective problems. In other
words, brokers play a role in producing political outcomes other
than votes.
