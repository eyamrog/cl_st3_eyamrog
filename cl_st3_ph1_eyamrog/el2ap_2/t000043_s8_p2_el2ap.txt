It was originally developed in 1995 for the evaluation of
vaccine safety in pharmacoepidemiology and nowadays it is used in
general epidemiology (1,6,7). It is derivative of a cohort study
design where individuals who have experienced the event of interest
are observed over time, within a pre-established observation period, where
the exposure history and the occurrence of the event of
interest are identified. During the observation period, the risk period
and the control period are established, which usually do not
have the same length of time. The risk period is
defined a priori and is considered as the time during
or after exposure where the individuals are at a higher
or reduced risk of the events of interest after an
exposure. The control period constitutes any time within the observation
period (before, after or between) the risk period (1,2,8). For
example, in a study to evaluate the risk of GBS
after Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) Vaccination in England, the risk
period started with vaccination (day 0) and ended on day
91 and a control period considered any time outside the
risk period (9).
