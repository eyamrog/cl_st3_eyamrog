Panoramic radiography is commonly used in daily dental practice because
it offers a full teeth/oral structures overview. Concerning the MC,
in the majority of cases, it can be detectable without
difficulty allowing the practitioner to evaluate the risk of IAN
injury during invasive interventions. However, this 2D technology lacks 3D
information and may not visualize the small details of the
MC [24].
