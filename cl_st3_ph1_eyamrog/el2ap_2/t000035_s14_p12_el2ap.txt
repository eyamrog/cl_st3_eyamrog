The first consultation, about 45 days before the campaign began,
aimed to screen indigenous people who required dentures. At this
stage, the dentist from the village health team performed anamnesis,
clinical examinations and selected the group of people to be
rehabilitated. A semi-structured interview was carried out to analyze problems
related to the lack of teeth and the expectations regarding
the dentures. All patients answered the socio-clinical-demographic questionnaire and underwent
an initial assessment of quality of life by responding to
the OHIP- 14 instrument, a questionnaire that consists of analyzing,
through 14 items, seven dimensions: functional limitation, physical pain, psychological
discomfort, physical disability, psychological disability, social disability and handicap. For
each of the 14 questions, a five- point scale was
used, where the answer determined the score of each question:
Never = 0; Almost never = 1; Occasionally = 2;
Almost always = 3 and Always = 420.
