Non-adherent dressings, such as polyurethane foam, silicone foams, silicone hydrocellular
foam, fibers, and hydrofibers, were recommended for promoting painless removal.
However, there is still a need to clarify the best
non-adherent therapy applied to MFWs due to changes in circulation
and the presence of non-viable tissue. Absorbent dressings were also
mentioned for MFW-related pain management, including the Pain of periwound
dermatitis caused by excessive MFW exudation and the irritating components
present in the exudate (Gozzo et al., 2014; Tamai et
al., 2016a).
