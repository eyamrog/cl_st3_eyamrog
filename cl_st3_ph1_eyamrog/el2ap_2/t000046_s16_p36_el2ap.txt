Regarding the category “Self-care,” we noticed a certain concern with
the establishment of limits and paths by the individual towards
health. In this sense, we can agree with Bracht (2019),
who stated that care itself can have two variables: the
first, when this practice is tensioned by oppression, in which
the individual is convinced to exert it; the second variable
can occur consciously, in a manifestation of the practice of
freedom, in which the body becomes an ally for the
development of a way of living.
