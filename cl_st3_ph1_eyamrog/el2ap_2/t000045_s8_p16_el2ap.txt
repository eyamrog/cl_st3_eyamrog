Literature on the Brazilian case has emphasized the role of
parties in structuring these relationships (Bezerra, 1999). They show evidence
that these organizations play a relevant role in maximizing results
in different electoral rounds at different federative levels and that
a victory in the mayoral election raises the parties’ electoral
chances in subsequent legislative elections (Fleischer, 2002; Carneiro and Almeida,
2008; Avelino, Biderman, and Barone, 2012; Novaes, 2018). In addition,
there is evidence of party coordination in the budget resource
allocation process that, in turn, would be crucial in the
electoral arena (Baião and Couto, 2017; Meireles, 2019).
