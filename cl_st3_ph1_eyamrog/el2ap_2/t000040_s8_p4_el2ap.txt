On the other hand, Kane et al. who assessed the
bucco-lingual position of the MC in 20 patients using computed
tomography (CT) found that the IAN and accompanying vessels are
situated more or less at 4.7mm from the buccal aspect
and at 1.8mm from the lingual side of the mandible
at the level of the mandibular first molar [9].
