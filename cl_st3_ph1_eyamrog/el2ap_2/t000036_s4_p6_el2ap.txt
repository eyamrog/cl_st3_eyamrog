In other words, a complete or almost complete application of
labor legal systems can be presumed in those workers who
belonged to the public sector and those workers in the
largest industrial sectors of the country. No reports or reports
have been found that analyzed the labor situation from the
application of the approved legal systems in the other sectors
of the population. This is understandable due to the informal
labor context and because a high portion of the economically
active population lived in barter systems or in labor contexts
whose salaries included payment in kind.
