Normally, information from past events may help define the risk
period (1). For example, in the case of influenza vaccines
and the development of Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS), the prespecified risk
period is 42 days after vaccination. This risk period was
stipulated after a cluster of GBS cases occurred in the
United States in 1976 after the population was vaccinated with
A/New Jersey influenza vaccine (10). During this risk period, it
is presumed that there will be increased risk of the
vaccinated individuals to develop the GBS and the time after
as the control period (1,11).
