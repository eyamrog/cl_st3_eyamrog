This proposed quality assessment tool has been used in a
few studies, some of which have been published or are
undergoing peer review. It is worth highlighting that this is
just an adaptation based on necessities that arose to evaluate
self-controlled study designs. In the course of time, it will
be subjected to a Delphi process to validate its use
and enhance its applicability. It is our expectation that the
tool will contribute to critical assessment of the methodological quality
of SCCS and SCRI studies and that it will be
continuously improved and adapted by the scientific community.
