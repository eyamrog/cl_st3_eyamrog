As explained in the previous section, it was decided to
adapt activities of the Vocabulary Corner, which concerns the vocabulary
learned through the whole textbook. In order to make the
activities more attractive and accessible to blind students, we opted
for the use of ludic approaches, that is, to promote
interaction of students in a pleasant and meaningful way, which
can instigate not only blind students, but also sighted students.
Therefore, the adaptations presented here are not focused on written
vocabulary, but the acknowledgement of those words in English language
and what they mean in those contexts.
