Leishmaniases are diseases caused by various species of the protozoan
parasite genus Leishmania, which are transmitted between humans, and wild
and domestic vertebrate animals, by the bites of blood-feeding female
sand flies [1]. In Brazil, American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) is
an endemic disease, but little is known about its impact
on indigenous human populations, especially those living in more remote
areas with little contact with non- indigenous people living outside
their territorial lands. In order to investigate the sand fly
fauna present during outbreaks of ACL among the Suruwaha and
the Waj√£pi indigenous people that occurred between 2012-2014, we carried
out fieldwork to collect these insects and identify potential vectors.
Insects were identified by keys available in the literature [3,4]
by experienced taxonomists.
