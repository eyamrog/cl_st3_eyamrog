Thirty-one (44.2%) studies examined opioids applied topically to the wound
bed to control MFW-related pain. The studies included non-systematic reviews
(67.7%), case studies (16.1%), randomized clinical trials (.06%) (including a
letter to the editor in which data from an unfinished
trial was reported), guidelines (.03%), prospective cohorts (.03%) and systematic
reviews (.03%). Of these 31 studies, just under a half
mentioned specific opioids to treat MFW-related pain, specifically suggesting Morphine.
Meanwhile, two of them also mentioned Oxycodone without describing its
preparation or ways of applying these drugs, as shown in
Table 5.
