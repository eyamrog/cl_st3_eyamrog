Having converted the YouTube text into an interpretable manuscript, the
analyst employed the snipping tool of the computer to cut
the configured script into about 35 shots, which were classified
into four different high-level mediated actions (HLMA) (Baldry & Thibault,
2010; Norris, 2019). The HLMA contains some low-level mediated actions
(LLMA) with various meaning-making modes. Each shot, labeled as O-BT
(Oral-B Transcript), reveals the transcript’s operational period ((e.g. O-BT1 (00:00
– 00:01))), as encoded at the left bottom side. The
complexity of the kinesics actions stimulated the production of many
shots publicized in the discussion domains. As there are Table
1 (showing HLMA shots and time) and Table 1 (indicating
the conversion of spoken modes into written structures), the study
presents the shots and analysis of the spoken modes side
by side within the framework of the discussion section.
