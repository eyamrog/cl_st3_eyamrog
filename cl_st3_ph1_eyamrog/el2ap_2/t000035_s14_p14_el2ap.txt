This phase sought to carry out proservation, basal and occlusal
adjustments and the evaluation of the prosthetic services performed. The
indigenous people who received prosthetic treatment underwent up to four
Post-Installation Control and Adjustment sessions, until the patient demonstrated they
were comfortable with the use of the dentures. Such adjustments
were made by the village dentist and one of the
professors from Faculdade SÃ£o Leopoldo Mandic.
