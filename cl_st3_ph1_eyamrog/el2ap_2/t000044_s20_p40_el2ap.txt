According to Chu and Kita (2016), there is evidence that
the gestures of co-judgment and co-speech share several properties, suggesting
that they are generated by a common mechanism. According to
the researchers, people produce more co-production gestures when speech production
is more difficult than when it is less difficult. They
produce more judgmental gestures when a quiet problem-solving task is
more difficult than when it is less difficult.
