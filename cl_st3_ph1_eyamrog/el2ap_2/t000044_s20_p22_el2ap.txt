Like the research made by Garcia and Infante (2012), Ramos
and Serrano (2013) also carried out their investigation through a
workshop (extension course) for undergraduates. The researchers interviewed undergraduate chemistry
students after carrying out activities using molecular modeling software. Analogous
to the considerations of Scherr (2008), the researchers in the
interviews tried to find out what was going on in
the students' minds when answering the questions, that is, it
was possible to identify a link with the gestures and
what they imagined at that moment to answer the questions.
