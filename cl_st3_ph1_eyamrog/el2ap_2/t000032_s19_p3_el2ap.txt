Comparison of the values for each Factor between Series revealed
a change in mood states as function of time (Figure
2). Temporal patterns of mood state changes were detected regarding
Factors IV (Limerence/Empathy) and VII (Interest). Higher Factor IV (Limerence/Empathy)
presence values were detected for Series 1 compared to Series
2 (p=0.012). Factor VII (Interest) presence values were higher for
Series 1 compared to Series 2 (p=0,003) and also to
Series 3 (being marginally significant in the latter case, with
p = 0.055). Thus Factor IV (Limerence/Empathy) presence values were
higher in Series 1 than in Series 2 and Factor
VII (Interest) presence values were also higher than those of
Series 2 and 3.
