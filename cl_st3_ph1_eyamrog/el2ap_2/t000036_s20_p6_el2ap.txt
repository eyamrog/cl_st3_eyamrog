This part of the population lived in a labor context
that arose from the Huasipungo, a space of land that
was rented for its production that served as a livelihood
for families and communities. The concertaje system worked in a
common way in rural sectors, especially in the Ecuadorian highlands,
generating the isolation of rural sectors from the local and
international market. This part of the economically active population was
outside domestic consumption and commercial exchange because they interchanged products
and were clients of the same products that they cultivated
or traded.
