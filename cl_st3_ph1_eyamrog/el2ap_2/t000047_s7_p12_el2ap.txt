Thus, syntagmatic specifies a cluster of items in a horizontal
axis that generates a semantic syntagm derivable from lexico-grammar. The
coherence in the paradigmatic modal entities, forming a unified whole
of the semiotic copresence, produces meaning. Upon that backdrop, Kress
and van Leeuwen (2001) comment that modes are lexically-arranged and
grammatically-organized elements of simple and complex system of meaning, perhaps,
comparable to the annotation of ranks in language structures (Thompson,
2014; Dalamu, 2018c). Resting on this equivalence mark, it could
be proportionally deducible that: if elements in language are systemic,
modes also are systemic â€“ a quality that could attract
a system network. It is in this sense that one
considers modes as a system of meaning-making, as shown further
below.
