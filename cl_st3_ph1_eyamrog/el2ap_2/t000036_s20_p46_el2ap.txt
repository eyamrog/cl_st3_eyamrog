Although the jobs that paid the least were those of
short underpants, the workers were not only dedicated to the
manufacture of underpants but also to other elements of the
textile sector. For this reason, they were not identified as
the sector with the lowest income. Finally, although working days
were officially considered based on 25 days, the days worked
per month varied according to the productive sector. In 1945,
and through the Decree 1740, the Secretary of Labor and
Forecast Juan Domingo Per√≥n generalized the right to enjoy paid
vacations workers from all sectors.
