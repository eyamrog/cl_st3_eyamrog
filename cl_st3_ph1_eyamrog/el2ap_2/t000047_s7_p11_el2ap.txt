Given that explication, one might submit that there are viable
norms that encircle the mode. Mode is a text. Mode
is a process. Mode is a product. Mode is a
choice. Mode is either animate or inanimate. Mode is a
system. Mode is coherent. Mode is meaningful. The classification of
mode as text refers to the meaning-making object, which appears
as words, pictures, gazes, and gestures. These features stimulate a
social actor to decide the choice of mode fit for
a semiotic system. Choice in this environment links readers to
the Paradigmatic standpoint of text. The course of selection indicates
a manner of processing modes for a setting. Leaning of
Halliday and Matthiessenâ€™s (2014) theorization, Paradigmatic designates a communicative vertical
axis of what goes instead of what, leaving behind unselected
items . The result of paradigmatic activity is syntagmatic.
