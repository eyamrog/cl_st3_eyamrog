This scoping review aimed to map and examine the literature
available on topical MFW- related pain management, considering its relevance
for oncology and palliative care clinicians. The synthesis of this
body of literature may provide insights into treatments which could
enhance quality-of-life, especially for patients with terminal cancer (Schmidt et
al., 2020). This study is the first scoping review developed
in its field to contribute to researchers seeking to advance
research trends and elucidate the gaps in this field.
