In the case of the peasants and part of the
indigenous sector who lived inside a huasipungo system, the context
of the labor system did not correspond to the reality
that was lived. In many cases, this group of workers
were “landless, homeless, without belongings of any kind, they commit,
sometimes for life, for a minimum amount whose debt is
never extinguished” (Albornoz 1931:47). The adaptation to this labor system
came gradually in later decades as the nation's economy improved
and the companies grew over time and multiplied in number.
Social security was founded in Ecuador as a state order
regime in 1928, from the “Pension Fund, which mainly established
the benefits of the retirement, civil and mortuary fund in
favor of civil and military officials” (Instituto Nacional de Previsión
1939:5).
