In this first proposal of the assessment tool, the overall
assessment of a study can be considered to be of
“poor quality” if the study is awarded 3 stars, “moderate
quality”, if the study is awarded up to 6 stars
and “high quality” if the study gets 7 to 10
stars. This is just a suggestion of how to grade
the overall quality of the study evaluated but the users
of the tool are at liberty to decide how this
can be applied in the studies analyzed depending on the
specificities of the research question tackled in those studies.
