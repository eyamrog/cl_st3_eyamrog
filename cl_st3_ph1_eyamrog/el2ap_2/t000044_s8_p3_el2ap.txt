Developing research based on gesture analysis is promising since the
use of gestures in education is still under-researched and a
relatively new topic (FLOOD et al., 2014). Not only, one
can infer how much gestures can help and contribute to
the learning process, since it is naturally present in our
daily lives, constituting - among other ways - a communication
channel between the most capable tutor and the learner, a
channel that is not properly discussed by most learning theories.
