We provide evidence that mayors and local councilors play an
essential role as brokers for some state representatives and that
regional ties and friendship are relevant factors in building alliances.
We also show that legislators nurture these partnerships by meeting
local brokers’ requests, acting to solve problems with the government
bureaucracy, and directing public resources to municipalities. We also argue
that although legislators strive to monitor brokers’ behavior, they are
not always able or willing to punish them.
