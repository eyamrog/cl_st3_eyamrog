Principal-agent theories have been an important reference to analyze the
relationships between brokers and bosses. Such theories are a common
theoretical framework in Political Science, especially in works inspired by
rational choice theory, to describe situations in which one actor
– the principal – provides incentives for another actor –
the agent(s) – to make decisions and pursue courses of
action that are convergent with the principal’s goals and interests
(Gailmard, 2012), given the premise that there is a conflict
of purposes between them. Therefore, in order to minimize agency
losses and discourage opportunistic behavior and the defection of brokers,
principals distribute rewards and punishments in the form of promises
of career advancement, positions in the public sector, advantages for
local allies in recruiting candidates, financial resources at election time,
among other private benefits (Camp, 2015; Novaes, 2018).
