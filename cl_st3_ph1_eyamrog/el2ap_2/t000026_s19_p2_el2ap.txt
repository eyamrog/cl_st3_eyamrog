Regarding the use of anxiolytic drugs, it was observed that
39.9% of the participants used these drugs, while 60.1% did
not use them. In this context, Table 2 presents a
correlation analysis between age, period, amount of anxiolytic medication, and
state-trait anxiety. It is noteworthy that no statistically significant relationship
was found between age, period, amount of anxiolytic medication, and
state anxiety. The same occurred between period, amount of anxiolytic
medication, and trait anxiety. However, there was a weak and
significant negative correlation between age and trait anxiety (r =
-0.114, p = 0.007).
