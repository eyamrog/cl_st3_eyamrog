This study investigates the nature of modal constructs in advertising
commercial, operational in Oral-B® Toothpaste, to explain the mechanistic integration
of modes, unified to generate holistic meaning. With the application
of the mood system and kinesics concepts, the author is
able to interpret the video for readers. Besides using statistical
substances (tables and graphs) to explore the modes, one observes
fragmentation of structures of some linguistic items such as The
answer?, Easy, still fresh and strong. Repetition is a concern,
where the communicator deploys the generic You, your teeth, and
your mouth for a reason of emphasis. Communicative devices such
as strong and healthy, and long lasting fresh breath (feeling)
are details, exemplifying the Oral-B’s 2-IN-1 qualities. Gestural modes of
smiling, observed in a repetitive speeches of Smile, Smile, Smile,
and intimate and personal distances augment meanings as Social Actors
1 and 2 are indexical participants. Metaphorical professional actors and
the dual 2-IN-1 features characterize the communication, projecting interchangeability. The
advertisement is fascinating; yet, the metaphor of interchangeability could have
been simplified for a purpose of sensitizing the illiterate.
