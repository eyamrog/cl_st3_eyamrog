The lack of research and teacher preparation on the education
of blind students, not only in the English language field,
may result in adverse consequences for these students’ inclusion and
independence. For those reasons, the constant search for interventional methods
and adapted materials that include blind students in the classroom
is an increasingly necessary action, so as to cease segregation
and help in the construction of the student’s autonomy. After
presenting the theoretical concepts, we present the practical moment, regarding
the choice of the textbook and the unit, as well
as the adaptation proposal for selected didactic activities.
