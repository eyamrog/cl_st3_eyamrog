In general, when accessing the questionnaire link, respondents were directed
to the Informed Consent Form (ICF) screen, which ensured voluntary
participation and anonymity, in addition to allowing withdrawal from the
study without prejudice to psychological integrity. Consent was obtained through
electronic acceptance, and it was necessary to click on "I
agree to participate in the research" to continue. Next, participants
were directed to a page containing the sociodemographic and clinical
questionnaire and the IDATE, with an average duration of 20
minutes.
