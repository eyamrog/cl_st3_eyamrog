For the correlational analysis, Kendall's Tau-b test was used to
assess the correlation of the scores (IDATE) between both indices,
analyzing the strength of the correlation with the variables age,
period and medications used. Additionally, the agreement rate between IDATE-T
and IDATE-E was verified through the Kappa (K) coefficient test.
For all analyses, a 95% confidence interval and a significance
level of p < 0.05 were adopted.
