Based on such considerations, our research questions are: How can
a blind student learn an additional language, without the access
to printed didactic activities and adapted materials, in regular classrooms?
Can visual and printed activities be adapted with everyday materials?
What are the teacherâ€™s options to make the EAL printed
activities reach the blind student? In order to answer those
questions, we suggest adaptations for didactic activities based on a
Review of Literature on the teaching and learning process of
blind students, which is presented after the Methodology.
