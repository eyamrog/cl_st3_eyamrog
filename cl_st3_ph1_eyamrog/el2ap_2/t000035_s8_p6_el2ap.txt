According to the 2016 annual management report12, due to structural
and logistical issues, the movement of indigenous people to urban
centers is difficult or even impossible, which, together with the
scarcity or even lack of specialized services in the vicinities
of indigenous villages, makes prosthetic rehabilitation procedures for the indigenous
population of the Special Indigenous Health District â€“ Bahia (or
DSEI Bahia) almost non-existent. The demand for prosthetic services in
the region is much higher than the installed capacity.
