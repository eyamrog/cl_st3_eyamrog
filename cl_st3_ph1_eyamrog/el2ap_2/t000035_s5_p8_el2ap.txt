An average of 9.8 for the phonetic criterion was obtained
during the final evaluation of the upper dentures, diverging from
the results obtained by Kawai et al.13, which, when using
the conventional and simplified technique, reported a significantly lower score
in an evaluation six months after the dentures were made.
This difference can be attributed to the fact that the
final evaluation of the study by Kawai et al. was
carried out six months after the installation of the dentures,
meaning there was insufficient time for full adaptation, in comparison
to the evaluation of the present study, which was performed
one year after the installation of the dentures. It can
also be attributed to the lengthy period during which the
patients in the campaign suffered edentulism, meaning that the treatment
had a significant impact on their quality of life, no
matter how small the improvement.
