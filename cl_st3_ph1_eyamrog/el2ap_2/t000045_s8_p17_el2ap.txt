Most studies that address the relationships between legislators and local
leaders focus on national representatives. Some evidence of the local
brokersâ€™ importance for state representatives can be found in Castro,
Anastasia, and Nunes (2009) and Melo (2011). Based on survey
data from twelve Brazilian states, these authors show that many
legislators value connections with local leaders and municipalities where they
were well voted. They frequently visit localities, work to channel
resources from budget amendments to the region, satisfy constituents' requests,
and help mayors in their endeavors to solve problems with
government agencies. They also show that a significant share of
state legislators believe that the most critical factor for their
reelection is their ability to send resources for their constituencies.
