Global research indicates that the prevalence of anxiety is higher
in college students than in non-college young adults of the
same age group. Auerbach et al. (2016) reported a prevalence
of 31% (n = 1.572) among students, compared to a
lower prevalence of 21.4% (n = 4.178) among non-students. In
a subsequent study, Auerbach et al. (2018) found that 31.1%
(n = 13.984) of students had an anxiety condition. In
the Brazilian context, Demenech et al. (2021) estimated that approximately
37.75% (n = 3.193) of higher education students had anxious
symptoms.
