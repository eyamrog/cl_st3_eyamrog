The set of mountains which compose the farm (figure 2)
shows a well-preserved vegetation, compared to vegetation at the lower
altitudes of the area. The predominant vegetation is dense tree-
shrubby, with some segments of open shrubby caatinga, riparian forests
of a temporary river, rupiculous and aquatic vegetation. In the
area where the farm is located there are many antrophic
activities such as cattle and goat raising and their subsistence
farming. Such activities do not expand to the mountainous areas,
being limited to the surroundings of mountains or close to
houses. Data collection - Floristic sampling was carried out from
2014 to 2017, period in which the botanical collections were
carried out through exploratory and random walks in the study
area, seeking to cover the larger possible area and all
phytophysiognomies present. Fertile specimens were collected using the technique and
method by preparing the botanical material according to parameters of
usual taxonomy (Judd et al. 2009, IBGE 2012). Important features
and information for the identification of the taxa were recorded
in a field book, in addition to the photographic record,
geographic coordinates, landscape and soil characterization.
