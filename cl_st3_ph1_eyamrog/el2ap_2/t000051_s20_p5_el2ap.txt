Scholz then expresses moral indignation about the violation of international
law and by drawing analogy to the Second World War,
invoking a personal perspective. This is recommended by speech writers,
as starting a speech by stating one’s personal attitude, feelings
and values makes the speech credible (PÖRKSEN, 2003, p.35). This
discourse of moral indignation is latent, expressed through a range
of realisations of judgement by social sanction, such as “kaltblütig
einen Angriffskrieg vom Zaun gebrochen” (‘started a war of aggression
in cold blood’), “menschenverachtend” (‘inhumane’) or “die ganze Skrupellosigkeit Putins”
(‘Putin’s complete ruthlessness’). The personal involvement is expressed through realisations
of affect such as “die schrecklichen Bilder” (‘the horrible images’),
“himmelschreiende Ungerechtigkeit” (‘appaling injustice’) and “furchtbaren Nachrichten” (‘terrible news’). The
personal perspective is also evident in the emotive approach to
a second discourse, that of international law, for instance in
the formulation “infamer Völkerrechtsbruch” (‘malicious breach of international law’), which
seems to suggest that some such breaches can be benevolent,
or the description of the Russian veto, which is its
right as a permanent member of the UN Security Council,
as a “Notbremse” (‘emergency brake’) and the added qualification of
“Was für eine Schande!” (‘What a disgrace!’).
