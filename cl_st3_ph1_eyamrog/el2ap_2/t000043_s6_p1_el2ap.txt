There are different quality evaluation tools for both quantitative and
qualitative studies. At times, researchers modify existing tools or develop
their own to meet their needs and this was our
case. In 2018, we had to evaluate SCCS and SCRI
included in a systematic review, and we couldnâ€™t find an
existing tool that could be used. This led us to
adapting the NOS for cohort studies.
