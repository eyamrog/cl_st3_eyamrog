In discussing relations between representatives and local actors, scholars commonly
ask to what extent party affinities structure alliances. In other
words, the question is to what extent alliances occur primarily
between co-partisans or involve any party coordination, so that brokers
become party agents and alliances yield votes for the organization’s
politicians. As mentioned before, the Brazilian case shows evidence of
partisan brokerage (Baião and Couto, 2017; Avelino, Biderman, Barone, 2012;
Barone, 2014; Bezerra, 1999; Meireles, 2019).
