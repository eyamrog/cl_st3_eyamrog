1. Detection of the phenomenon. These are all those situations
in which children interact with the materials by perceiving some
characteristics without continuing further investigation. An example is represented by
Leonardo who looks at the plastic bottles, lies down on
the ground, takes aim, blows on one of the standing
bottles. He repeats the action a couple of times by
blowing harder and harder until he manages to make it
fall.
