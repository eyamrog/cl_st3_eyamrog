One randomized clinical trial (Lund-Nielsen et al., 2011) included in
a systematic review (Adderley & Holt, 2014) reported positive results
when using antimicrobials to control MFW odor, exudate, and pain.
Three studies tested antimicrobials to manage MFW symptoms, including pain.
Two were randomized clinical trials, and one was a retrospective
cohort that included 192 patients with MFWs, mainly women aged
between 47 and 90 years and primarily with breast cancer.
Of these clinical trials, two used a verbal numeric scale
and a visual analog scale, demonstrating improvement in pain; the
third found no statistically significant effect on the pain outcome
(Table 7).
