In this context, the Dentures in One Day Technique was
proposed, based on four basic pillars. The first consists of
the use of prefabricated, flexible dental arches with adjustable teeth
(patent PI0602107-7 B1). With this technology, the artificial teeth are
pre-assembled on a flexible support base made of acrylic elastomeric
material, capable of three-dimensional movement. The flexibility of the elastomer
allows the base to be adapted to the patient's anatomy,
and the set of upper and lower teeth to be
assembled at the same time. The base material also allows
the position of the teeth to be adjusted individually, in
case the correction of aesthetic, phonetic or occlusal problems is
required. The bases of the prefabricated dental arches are made
of temporary material, which is completely removed during the acrylization
of the dentures and is replaced by heat activated acrylic
resin (HAAR) based on poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA).
