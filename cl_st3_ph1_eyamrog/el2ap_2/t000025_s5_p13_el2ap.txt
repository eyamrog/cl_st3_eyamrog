Wound-related pain is not limited to the wound bed area
and may involve periwound skin. MFWs can evolve with high
exudation, irritating to the periwound skin, and are characterized by
inflammation with or without erosion, itching, pain, and potential skin
damage secondary to infection (Tamai et al., 2016b). Due to
constant moisture, periwound protection is recommended using a suitable barrier
product that can repel excess moisture, protecting the skin from
consequent damage (LeBlanc et al., 2021). However, there are few
studies on using these products in patients with MFWs.
