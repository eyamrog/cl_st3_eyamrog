The SCCS and SCRI study designs are used in pharmacovigilance
and are useful in analyzing rare events. They have been
commonly used in studying populations after vaccine exposure like in
the case of influenza vaccines and Human Papillomavirus vaccines (28,29)
. Since 2020, the world has been facing the Covid-19
pandemic and in 2021, Covid-19 vaccines started being administered in
all parts of the world. There has been temporal association
of the Covid-19 vaccines or SARS-CoV-2 infection with the development
of events like GBS, cardiovascular events like stroke, encephalitis, psychiatric
events among others (30â€“32). A huge number of both primary
and secondary studies have been produced to report these events.
The SCCS and SCRI could also be used in such
cases and the use of the proposed quality assessment tool
would be useful in ascertaining that the methodological rigor was
adhered to, thus making the findings more reliable.
