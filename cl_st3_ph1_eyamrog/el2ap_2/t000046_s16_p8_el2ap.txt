Maldonado and Silva (2018), in analysis of REESP curricula regarding
PE, affirm the existence of different perspectives: in 1978, the
approach was centered on fitness and the development of motor
skills; in 1991 the approach was psychomotor with links to
a critical discussion influenced by the human sciences; in 1996
the psychomotor approach remains, but now with contributions from the
developmental line; in 2008 it was focused on the critical
approaches of PE, specifically the critic- overcoming and critic-emancipatory approaches.
By observing Chart 1, we can understand that 12 of
the 13 teachers experienced at least two phases of the
PE curriculum at REESP. That is, data on the understanding
of health and its relation with PE are immersed in
meanings derived from a transition of approaches, from instrumental to
critical.
