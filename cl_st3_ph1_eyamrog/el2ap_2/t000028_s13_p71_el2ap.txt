Other than group and tactile activities, the EAL teacher might
opt for working with sounds or songs. Such an approach
draws attention to the use of orality in class, that
is, the practical uses of oral genres in different contexts.
In Camargo and Nardiâ€™s research (2006), future teachers also made
use of orality by suggesting, for example, oral presentations and
theatrical plays in class, in order to overcome impasses that
might arise from teaching Physics to blind students.
