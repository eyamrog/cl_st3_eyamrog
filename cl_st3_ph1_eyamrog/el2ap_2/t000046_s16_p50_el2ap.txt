“[...] it should be important, but PE is not fulfilling
its role. That’s my vision. From the moment that some
students mostly sit while a group plays soccer, PE is
not solving the health problem it should solve” (Juliana –
Geography teacher). “We know those clichés, that moving is good
for health, we became sedentary throughout history. We used to
fished, hunt, run to eat and then moving. Today, it
is very easy to open the fridge and get the
food and we, most of the population, became obese. So,
exercising is important for health, indeed” (Bruna – Geography teacher).
