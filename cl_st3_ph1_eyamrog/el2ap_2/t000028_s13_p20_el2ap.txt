The results by Biagini and Gonçalves (2017) are an example
of the blind student’s dependence on teacher assistance, which is
related to unpreparedness of the teacher and lack of information
on how to deal with a blind student in class.
That situation may also impact on blind students’ socialization and
introspection, as in João’s case. He only participated in group
and oral activities responding to the interventions of his colleagues
and teachers, even though such activities were planned considering his
impairment (BIAGINI; GONÇALVES, 2017).
