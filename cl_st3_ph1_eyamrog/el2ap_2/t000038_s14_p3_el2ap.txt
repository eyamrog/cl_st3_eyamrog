We evaluated the adequacy of the model using the Root
Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), and
Comparative Fit Index (CFI) fit indices. According to Brown (2015),
RMSEA values must be less than 0.08, with confidence intervals
not reaching 0.10. TLI and CFI values must be above
0.90, or preferably 0.95.
