One of the industries that received differential treatment was the
nitrate industry. The wages for this productive sector were published
on January 8, 1934: those workers who remained in single
marital status received a minimum wage of 10 pesos per
day; for those workers who were married or were heads
of family, they received 15 pesos per day; and, those
workers who were older adults, had a disability or were
minors, their salary was calculated at the rate of 50%
of the salary of a single worker.
