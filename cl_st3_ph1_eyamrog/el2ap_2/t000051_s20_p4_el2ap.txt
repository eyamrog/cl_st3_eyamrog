That analysis shifts the focus away from modern great powers’
existence and implication in the Ukraine war and simplifies it
as a purely historically revisionist attack. It also implies that
power does not routinely break international law, which is an
odd observation given just the history of recent NATO operations
globally or the war in Yugoslavia in Europe (GRAY, 2018;
D. JOHNSTONE, 2022). While Scholz is adamant that the invasion
of Ukraine marks the dawn of a new era, the
politics of armament announced as a reaction to that new
era are allegedly aimed at preventing such a new era,
at retaining the current order. It is thus unclear what
exactly this new era is supposed to consist of. Does
Scholz say “warmongers like Putin” because he expects there to
be others? If the goal is to preserve the current
order of security and international law as we know it
in Europe and not to return to an era of
military aggression and war, why do Scholz and other German
politicians so adamantly announce the dawn of a new era
of defence spending?
