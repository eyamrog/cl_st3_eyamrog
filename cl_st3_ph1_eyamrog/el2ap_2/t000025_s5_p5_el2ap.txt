Studies on the use of dressings predominated as a proposal
for topical therapy for MFW- related pain management. The treatment
of pain that arises from changing dressings due to the
adhesion of the product to the wound bed and the
subsequent difficulty of removing it was highlighted. This demonstrates the
benefits of protecting friable tissue in the wound bed in
a malignant fungating wound. (Woo et al., 2015; Woo &
Sibbald, 2010).
