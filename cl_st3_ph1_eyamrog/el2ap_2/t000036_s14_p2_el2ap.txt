Although the methodology can be circumscribed as part of Social
History or Economic History, the article was written within the
guide of the historical objectivity that can be found and
narrated in research, taking into account their obvious limitations, and
in line with the school of thought of the well-recognized
Leopold Von Ranke as he saw History as the presentation
of facts, “to history has been given the function of
judging the past, of instructing men for the profit of
future years. The present attempt does nor aspire to such
a lofty undertaking. It merely wants to show how it
essentially was” (Iggers 2011:86). Thus, the article will develop first
within the economic context; then, within the legal system; and,
finally, in relation to the minimum wage.
