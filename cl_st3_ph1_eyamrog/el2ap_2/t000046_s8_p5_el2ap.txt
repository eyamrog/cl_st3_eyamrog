This conception was incorporated by the National Curriculum Parameters (PCN)
(BRASIL, 1998; 2000) and, recently, by the National Common Curriculum
Base (BNCC) (BRASIL, 2017). A relevant issue in these and
other documents is that health should be the object of
work of all school agents. However, when normative proposals are
analyzed based on collective health (WESTPHAL, 2013), they show that
they are still in a behavioral line, which, aligned with
the natural sciences, excels in the adoption of healthy lifestyles.
