Finally, Camargo and Nardi (2006) contribute with alternatives for teaching
methods suggested by undergraduate Physics teachers, in order to include
the blind students in class. For the adaptation of printed
materials, such as written evaluations, the future teachers suggested oral
activities and recorded audios; for practical experiments, the idea was
to make use of everyday materials, which explore the tactile
and audible senses. It was also suggested group activities that
encourage sighted and non-sighted students to interact and work together,
such as debates, reading and discussion activities (in which there
is use of orality and students may assume complementary roles)
and even theatrical plays. Furthermore, the authors and the undergraduate
students highlight the importance of active, inclusive, dialogic and participative
educational approaches, which encourage “students’ attitudes of reflection, analysis, decision-making,
and teachers’ attitudes of knowledge of their students’ ideas throughout
the educational process” (CAMARGO; NARDI, 2006, p. 56).
