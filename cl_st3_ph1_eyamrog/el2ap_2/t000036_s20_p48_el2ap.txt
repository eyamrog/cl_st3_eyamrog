Four years later, in 1937, the minimum wage for the
commercial and industrial sectors was legalized. The workers received a
minimum wage of 140 bolivianos, without gender identification; for those
workers considered older adults, their minimum wage were five bolivianos
a day; while, for minor workers, between 14-18 years old,
their salary were three bolivianos per day. This regulation excluded
workers in the agricultural sector with a total of assets
that did not exceed 50,000 bolivianos.
