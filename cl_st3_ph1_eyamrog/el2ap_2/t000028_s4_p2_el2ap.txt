It is known that the government should provide what is
needed for public education, but there might be schools in
which the didactic material necessary for blind studentsâ€™ education is
not available. The responsibility then is delegated to the teacher,
who might need to think of an adaptation for the
material initially designed, especially when such material is a textbook
or printed activities. Therefore, it is necessary for us, language
teachers, to learn at least some basic forms of adaptation,
as well as to communicate with blind students, in order
to work with the best method according to their necessities
and difficulties.
