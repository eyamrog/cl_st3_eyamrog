Such ideas for teaching methods to include blind students in
class are relevant not only for the Physics area, but
for all educational fields, as they can be adapted and
used in other disciplines. In the present work’s case, for
example, although the articles from the Review may differ from
our research’s proposal in terms of pedagogical objectives, actions and
educational area, they still bring valuable contributions to the development
of our adaptation of EAL activities for blind students.
