Our interviews suggest that offices can work to serve those
who have cast votes and shown loyalty in the past,
as well as those who may deliver votes in the
future. A legislator may use this forward-looking strategy when she
intends to expand her influence to other regions. Although this
is not the rule, a representative may take the initiative
to gain a new ally by allocating resources to a
locality without the mayor's request and without her committment to
support the representative. The chief of staff and other advisors
also work to attract new allies, using their professional or
personal connections to link the representative to mayors and local
political groups.
