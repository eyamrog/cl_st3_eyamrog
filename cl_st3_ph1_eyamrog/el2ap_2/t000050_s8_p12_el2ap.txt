The Waj達pi are a group of about 1,200 people [15],
distributed in 80 small villages scattered throughout their territory. All
families subsist by agriculture, fishing, hunting and gathering, periodically changing
the location of their villages to allow the ecological recovery
of the areas they have occupied. Access to the villages
can be via the road, rivers and streams that cross
their territory, as well as open trails through the forest.
The resumption of the traditional model of Waj達pi occupation and
dispersal for territorial exploitation, which maintains the quality of life
of the people and, at the same time, guarantees territorial
surveillance was essential to guarantee the pattern of abundance that
the Waj達pi consider adequate [16]. In the last 10 years,
the activity of large mining companies, and the building of
hydroelectric plants, in the environment surrounding the WIL threatens the
quality of life of the Waj達pi, through forest degradation, environmental
contamination, and the insertion of the community in a context
of great social vulnerability, which coincides with the increased incidence
of pests in crops and endemic diseases, such as malaria
and leishmaniasis.
