In terms of the correlation between gender and state anxiety,
it was noted that a higher proportion of women (68%)
exhibited moderate anxiety levels in comparison to men (60.3%). Regarding
sex and trait anxiety, 51.8% of women had high levels
of anxiety, while 57.1% of men had moderate levels. These
data suggest the existence of differences in the prevalence of
anxiety between men and women, depending on the type of
anxiety assessed (state or trait).
