Workers on the Coast earned 1.2 sucres, while workers in
the Sierra received 0.60 sucres. In the case of workers
under 18 years of age, and women, whether in the
manual sector or in the agricultural sector, the minimum wage
was calculated at a rate of 2/3 of the established
one. The legal body did not describe the salary of
domestic workers (Pan American Union 1937).
