‚óè Cream with essential oils. Only one case study (1.4%)
published in 2014 (Stringer et al., 2014) evaluated the use
of a cream with essential oils in 12 patients (mostly
women with breast cancer with ages between 40 and 81
years) for MFW symptoms. The cream contained 3% essential oils
(without specifying ingredients). Without standardizing the dressings and reporting the
cream's form and several applications on the wounds, the authors
mentioned that six patients reported pain improvement (reducing the maximum
score to zero on a Likert scale).
