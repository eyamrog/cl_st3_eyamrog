Current literature regarding topical interventions for the management of MFWs
is inconsistent with the use of different topical substances with
varying analgesic effects, such as opioids, anti-inflammatory drugs, anesthetics, and
non-adherent dressings (EONS, 2015). Topical pain treatment may be preferred
over systemic use of medication linked to many devastating side
effects. In addition, the bioavailability of systemic pain medication can
be unpredictable for controlling MFW-related pain due to altered circulation
caused by malignant infiltration (LeBon et al., 2009).
