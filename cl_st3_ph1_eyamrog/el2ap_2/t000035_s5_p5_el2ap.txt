Good communication helps reduce anxiety, misunderstandings and doubts and leads
to the satisfaction of both patient and dental professional32, a
fact that must have helped to achieve the results obtained
in the current project, as all dentists involved in the
campaign are linked to the indigenous oral health team, and
are therefore accustomed to working with indigenous patients, thus optimizing
the dental professional-patient relationship.
