Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, top German politicians have
coincided rhetorically in announcing that the Russians have forced “us”
into a “Zeitenwende” (‘dawn of a new era’), a “watershed”,
a “new era” and a “new reality”. “With his attack
on Ukraine on Thursday, President Putin has created a new
reality”, said German chancellor Olaf Scholz in his policy statement
on 27 February 2022. “Russia’s war marks the dawn of
a new era. It’s a watershed moment. Yesterday’s certainties are
gone. Today, we face a new reality that none of
us chose. It is a reality that President Putin has
forced upon us”, said German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock at
her speech at the United Nations. It is notable that
the word truce did not occur at all in these
speeches. Instead of demanding de-escalation and dialogue, Scholz announced an
armament plan that would make Germany the world’s third largest
spender on defence. While Germany was never the pacifist country
that self-perception myths had entertained (DALGAARD-NIELSEN, 2005; RATHBUN, 2006), Scholz’s
decision still means a paradigm shift in German military culture.
