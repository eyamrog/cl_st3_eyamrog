The interviews show that it is possible to distinguish between
two types of legislators. One is the policy-oriented, who devote
more time and energy to lawmaking and institutional activities. The
other prefers constituency service and attribute a great value to
municipalities and local leaders, or, in terms of the interviewees,
to the “political affairs”.
