It is possible to create a high-relief calendar using velcro,
EVE, cardboard and glue, which the blind student is able
to assemble and disassemble each day. Such activity can also
be arranged together with activity C and/or activity B, to
design a more complete calendar. In this way, there would
be three packs of EVE cards (one with seven cards
for the days of the week, one with the 31
numbers constituting the months and another one with the 12
months), and also a piece of cardboard in which the
day of the week, month and numeral would be glued
with velcro. As the former proposal, the words and numbers
can be written in the Braille system or, like in
the model below (created digitally), in the alphabetic/numeric system in
high-relief (Image 9).
