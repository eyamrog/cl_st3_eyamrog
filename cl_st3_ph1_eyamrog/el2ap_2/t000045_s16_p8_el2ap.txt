Considering the aggregate of representatives who cited mayors and/or city
councilors as one of the most important supports for their
election, there is some variation between states (Appendix B)10. In
both waves, they are most cited in Bahia, Pernambuco, and
Tocantins, and least cited in Mato Grosso, Rio Grande do
Sul, and Rio de Janeiro. Thus, despite the difference in
their size, the patternâ€™s stability between them is striking. Regarding
parties (those with 10 or more members who were interviewed),
in both waves the PT has a lower than average
proportion of mentions to mayors and/or councilors, while DEM, PMDB,
PP and PSDB have a higher than average proportion (Appendix
B).
