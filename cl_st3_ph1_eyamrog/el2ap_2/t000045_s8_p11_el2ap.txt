Several features of the Brazilian political system (such as the
federative organization, electoral system, definition of electoral districts, separate elections,
and concentration of resources at the central level) induce cooperation
among local and state/national political actors, either in the period
between elections or in the election period (Carneiro and Almeida,
2008). The literature in the electoral and legislative studies presents
evidence that connections between local leaderships and representatives are an
essential feature of Brazilian politics.
