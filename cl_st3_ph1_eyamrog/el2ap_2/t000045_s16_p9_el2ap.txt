However, in both waves, the category that appeared in first
place in legislatorsâ€™ answers as the most important for their
victory involved community leaders11. This result contrasts with the in-depth
interviews, in which current and former elected officials (mayors and
councilors) received much more prominence than other types of leaders.
This contrast is probably due to the difference in profile
between the survey sample (with representatives with different profiles and
spatial patterns of votes) and the interview sample, which focused
on legislators with more concentrated votes.
