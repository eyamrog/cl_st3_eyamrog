Among the species of Heliconia that occur in the State
of São Paulo, H. farinosa is similar to H. subulata
Ruiz & Pav., being differentiated by the presence of an
elliptical or oblong blade, fertile basal bract and elliptical bracteole,
while H. farinosa has only elliptical blades, foliate, fertile or
sterile basal bract and oval-lanceolate bracteole (Braga 2020). This species
can be differentiated from other Zingiberales of the Núcleo Curucutu
due to its boat-shaped bracts and leaves, mostly lacerated.
