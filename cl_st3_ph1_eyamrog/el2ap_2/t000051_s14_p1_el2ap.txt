The text under analysis is the Regierungserklärung (‘policy statement’) given
by Olaf Scholz on 27 February 2022, three days after
the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The text is drawn from
the German government’s website (SCHOLZ, 2022). On this website, apart
from the original German text, translations into English and Russian
are also available, which indicates some secondary addressees. The translations
of the examples in this paper are partly official and
partly my own.
