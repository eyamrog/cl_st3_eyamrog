“For the second year, I teach cytology, the chemical composition
of living beings, so I try to work [with heath],
and I know that the PE teacher also enters a
little in this area. I think that PE also has
to do with mental health, because it is the opportunity
to develop coexistence. We have a heterogeneous group, the state
receives students from different realities. We have students that are
supervised by the family, who are supported. We know that
other students have a different reality, lack attention and guidance,
so I think that PE is interesting due to these
two aspects, I try to make this bond, with nutrition,
development and body formation and coexistence” (Larissa – Sciences teacher).
