Thus, exposure to a challenging environment during academic training can
increase susceptibility to the development of anxiety, negatively affecting the
academic performance and well-being of the university student (Balapala &

is defined as a mental state of restlessness and disorder
characterized by the presence of worry, avoidance, and emotional reactivity
or arousal that cause an unrealistic and unpleasant emotional state
in the individual (Gama et al., 2021).
