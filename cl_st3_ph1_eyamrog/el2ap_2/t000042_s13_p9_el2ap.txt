Bolsonaro and Doria launched vaccination programs in March 2021. In
a superficial attempt calculated to silence his critics, Bolsonaro replaced
Pazuello with Marcelo Queiroga, a private-sector physician who promised to
speed up vaccination but never promoted the use of masks,
and gave cover both to Bolsonaro’s strident declarations and the
president's unsuccessful efforts to undermine vaccination programs. However, Queiroga and
Bolsonaro were unable to silence the accusations of necropolitical policies
and corruption in the procurement of vaccines directed against the
government. An article in the British Medical Journal accused the
government of “crimes against humanity” because of “massive and systematic
use of pressure to induce the public to behave a
certain way, according to a preconceived plan.”24
