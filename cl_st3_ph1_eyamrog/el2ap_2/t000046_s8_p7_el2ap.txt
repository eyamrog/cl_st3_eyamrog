Oliveira, Martins and Bracht (2015a) emphasizes that, by using the
discourse of physical activity as a means for an active
or healthy life, besides contributing to the reinforcement of the
conception that the systematization of body movement is a means
for a given purpose, it serves as a market reinforcement
of health, directly or indirectly. In the same line, there
is a demand in contemporary society that directs the focus
to create a consumer relationship. In this sense, Westphal (2013)
draws attention to the issue of induction existing in society,
because the media ends up stimulating free choice based on
market logic, eventually imposing healthy lifestyles.
