Gestures in the teaching of a second language can contribute
to the way a new word is presented, the way
an assessment is performed, and even provide greater articulation between
the gestures and the new words. In inclusive education, the
use of gestures may provide new avenues for research in
this area, perhaps a new resource that contributes and assists
teachers and students with disabilities or disorders. And in science
and mathematics teaching, gestures emerge as a tool to contribute
to the teaching of concepts considered abstract and complex.
