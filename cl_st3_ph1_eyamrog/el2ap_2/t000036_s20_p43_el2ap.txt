The first sector in which the minimum wage was imposed
and legalized was in the public sector. Public sector workers,
through a legal decree on September 28, 1934, were divided
into two geographical zones, each of these zones were accompanied
by a letter, zone A and zone E: zone A:
160 pesos monthly or 6,40 pesos daily; zone E: 90
pesos monthly or 3,60 pesos daily. Minimum wages for the
private sector were implemented on April 15, 1935 for the
textile industry and on June 9, 1937 for footwear companies.
