Ferreira and Dickman (2015) brought different notions: through interviews with
blind students, they highlighted the most relevant aspects to be
taken into consideration in class. In one of the excerpts,
the participating student reports the blind student should have the
same conditions and the necessary adaptations, in order to achieve
the same level of understanding as the others. Furthermore, the
student calls attention to the importance of practical activities and
dialogues between teacher and student, so that the learning of
Physics (or any other discipline) does not seem to be
so difficult to the point that the student gives up.
As a solution, Ferreira and Dickman (2015) propose some ideas
of adaptations given by the participants (teachers and students): when
printed, the description of images and graphs is necessary (and
recommended); also, the teacher reported the experience with a mockup,
which may be interpreted by the blind student through the
tactile sense.
