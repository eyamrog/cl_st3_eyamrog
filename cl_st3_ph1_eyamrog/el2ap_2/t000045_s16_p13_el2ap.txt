For most legislators, it is very important [the mayor's support].
Let's suppose that you are the mayor of [municipality], then
I go there alone and ask for a vote: nobody
knows me. People from the interior trust the mayors, the
councilors, the leaders who talk about the legislator (Chief of
Staff 2).
