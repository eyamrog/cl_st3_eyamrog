Within the textile industry, wages are also differentiated between those
who work in wool raincoats and those who work in
shorts. The former with a minimum of 11 pesos, and
the latter with a minimum of 12 pesos. The masons'
strike of 1936 (Owen 1938) caused the authorities to publish
the resolution of March 24, which formalized the minimum wage
for foremen (6.40 pesos), foreman assistants (5.2 pesos), and pawns
(4.5 pesos).
