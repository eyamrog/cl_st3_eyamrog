Some documents (Proposal for key principles of a Quality framework
for Early Childhood Education and Care, 2014, National Guidelines for
the Curriculum, 2012) establish the importance of formative evaluation as
a research and innovation process. The educational evaluation, through the
observation and analysis of the educational documentation allows the teacher
to evaluate his educational proposal and improve it to promote
learning. To develop this topic, I will refer to research
on scientific education in nursery school. This research refers to
the theoretical contribution of Dewey (1933;1938), Vygotsky (1930; 1934), Wood,
Bruner, Ross (1976), to the psychoanalysis regarding the psychic processes
as the base for curiosity and to the experience of
Susan Isaacs (1930; 1933) at the Malting House. The main
objective of the research is to highlight the conditions (space,
material, adult approach) which best promote a scientific investigation of
the children. The approach of ‘promoting from within’ (Bondioli, 2008;
Bondioli, Savio, 2009; Bondioli, 2015) as a useful reference for
designing and setting up adult intervention aimed at promoting the
development of a scientific attitude. I collected the data through
videotapes, observation protocols and I elaborated two analysis grids: one
related to the epistemic conduct of the children and the
other concerning the strategies and functions of the adult. The
first analysis highlighted some interesting suggestion regarding the conditions of
the educational context (adult intervention strategy, material, space) that best
promote the development of a scientific attitude in terms of
the acquisition of critical thinking.
