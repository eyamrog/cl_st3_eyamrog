The Núcleo Curucutu located at the coordinates 23°59'09.7"S and 46°44'32.5"W
was created in 1977, concomitantly to the Parque Estadual Serra
do Mar, covering the municipalities of São Paulo, Itanhaém, Mongaguá
and Juquitiba, having its origins in the Fazenda Curucutu, a
coal producer, acquired by the State in 1958 and transformed
into a Forest Reserve (Bellato & Mendes 2002, PESM 2021a).
