Some European documents (Indicazioni Nazionali per il Curricolo della Scuola
dell’Infanzia e del Primo Ciclo di Istruzione, 2012; Quality Toolbox:
Executive Summary, 2012; Proposal for Key Principles of a Quality
Framework for Early Childhood Education and Care, 2014) categorically refuse
the idea of evaluation as a mere classification and judgment.
On the contrary, the evaluating action carried out by the
teacher has the purpose of recognizing, describing, and promoting growth
and development. The previously cited documents convey a central role
to professional strategies such as observation and documentation, also stressing
the importance of the auto evaluation both of the child
and the teacher. Analyzing the previously collected documents in teams
is helpful because it leads to the recognition of the
coherence between pedagogic concepts, cultural choices, and actions taken to
carry them out (Raso, Lampugnani, Marone, Lichene, 2020). From this
perspective, evaluation is a fundamental tool in the constant improvement
of the schools’ educational offer, aimed at handling the educational
act that promotes the children’s development. According to this concept,
the Proposal for Key Principles of a Quality Framework for
Early Childhood Education and Care (2012) conveys to evaluation the
purpose of recognizing, accompanying, describing, and documenting the processes of
development without classifying and judging the performances.
