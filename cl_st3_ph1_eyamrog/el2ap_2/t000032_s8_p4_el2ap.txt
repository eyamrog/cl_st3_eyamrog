Applicable instruments for the investigation of this wide range of
mood states in sports contexts are necessary. The Present Mood
States List (PMSL) elaborated by Engelmann (1986, 2001) is a
Brazilian instrument which involves positive and negative mood states, resulting
from wide empirical research performed in Brazil and could probabilistically
give adequate access to subjective states of people. PMSL measures
the presence of a person’s mood states at the time
when is responding and has been used in the investigation
of Present Mood States in sport in Brazil (Bueno &
Di Bonifácio, 2007, 2009; Bueno & Souza, 2019).
