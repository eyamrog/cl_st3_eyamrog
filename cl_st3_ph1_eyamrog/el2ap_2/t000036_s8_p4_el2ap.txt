In this economic and political context, the research proposes to
analyze some of the most important variables in relation to
the working conditions of workers in Ecuador during the 1930s.
On the one hand, the context of purchasing power and
the wages received by workers will be analyzed, taking into
account three groups, namely: first, a group of workers who
lived from barter and community survival systems; second, a group
of salaried farmers and small business workers who received a
daily wage plus certain compensation in kind; third, the group
of workers found in the centralized public sector and in
the industrial sector.
