The present study expands the investigation of Present Mood States
of athletes by assessing them not only immediately before a
match, but also during the training sessions, allowing the analysis
of changes in these mood states as a function of
time course during a competitive period. Martini (2000 pp. 103)
pointed out that “The psychological preparation of sportsmen (...) should
be based on systematic interventions carried out according to a
program that will accompany and consider the succession of sport
events”. The data obtained in the present study permit a
better understanding of how, when and which mood states change,
providing better support to the planning and implementation of interventions
in the preparation of athletes for competition. Thus, it is
important to include the dynamic component of temporality as a
variable affecting the models of variation of neuropsychological processes (Staddon
& Bueno, 1991), especially in investigations of subjective aspects such
as Present Mood States within the sport context.
