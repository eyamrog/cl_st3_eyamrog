Entering university is an important milestone in the lives of
many young people. Indeed, it is a period of maturational
transformations, including physiological, neurological, and psychological changes that occur during
the transition from adolescence to adulthood (Silva & Costa, 2012).
This transition can be challenging as it requires adaptation to
a new social role and changes in various aspects of
the university studentâ€™s life (Ferreira et al., 2009; Pereira &
Ramos, 2021).
