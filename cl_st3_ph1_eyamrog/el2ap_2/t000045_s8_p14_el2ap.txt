There is evidence that this cooperation brings electoral payoffs for
both sides of the relationship. Avelino, Biderman, and Barone (2012)
and Barone (2014) show that a victory in the mayoral
election increases the parties' electoral chances for state and national
offices. At the same time, Eduardo (2016) shows that an
alliance with legislators increases the electoral chances of mayors, especially
in small towns, and when voters believe that it will
result in collective benefits for the municipality.
