Most patients reported that eating was a problem caused by
lack of teeth. After one year, it was observed that
high scores were attributed for the ability to chew food,
obtaining a median value of 10 for all foods and
a lower average for coconut flesh (7.2), a very hard
food, whose firm texture has already been reported as difficult
to chew by users of dentures35. It is worth mentioning
that all the foods are routinely consumed by indigenous peoples
and are also used and found in the diets of
people living in urban centers. This result corroborates previous study
that found an improvement in the self-assessment of chewing function
after the preparation of the new dentures36.
