promotion from within + final conversation. This educational approach is
similar to the above-cited, but, at the end of the
activities, the researcher encourages the children to revisit and reflect
on the experience by discussing it. In this scenario, the
adult must favor the discussion, confrontation, and reflection through specific
questions: what did we do today? What did we observe?
How can we continue the experience? In this case, the
purpose is to analyze if and how this approach from
the adult, who not only promotes from within but also
favors a participative reflection on the experience, can influence the
manifestation of scientific attitudes. Moreover, this approach also investigates the
impact of the metacognitive dimension.
