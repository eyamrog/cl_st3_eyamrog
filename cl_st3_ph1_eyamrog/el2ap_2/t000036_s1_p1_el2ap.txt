The article carries out an analysis of the labor context
in Ecuador during the 1930s with the aim of contributing
with new quantitative, legal and contextual information. This information is
important as they add three essential elements to understand the
work context: economically active population and purchasing power; legal context
on labor conditions; and, a brief review on the implementation
of the minimum wage. This analysis was carried out based
on a historical- comparative and analytical method, taking into account
three groups of workers, namely: workers in the public and
industrial sector; workers in the interior and small industry; and,
workers in rural sectors. Multiple legal benefits have been found
for the first group, such as compensation for eviction, premature
separation, maternity, disability, overtime worked, in addition to a minimum
wage differentiated by zone and type of work. For the
second group, the legal benefits are random, and the minimum
wages paid are assumed to be daily wages and paid
in kind. For the third group, the legal benefits are
non-existent, as they live within their own cultural conditions, which
excludes them from the legalization of labor systems, their salary
compensations are in kind or in food exchange.
