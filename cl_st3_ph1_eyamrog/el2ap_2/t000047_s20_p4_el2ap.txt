The domain of this communication appears to be within the
Oral-B Dental Institute. That might be the reason for projecting
the institute first as a prologue. Besides, the environment that
illustrates that position, one could also argue that the sudden
appearance of the social actor two (labeled as Social Actor
2) in the event, is a testimony to that. As
well planned, Social Actor 2 interposes the negotiation, saying that:
But that breath feeling just doesn’t last. The paratactic, But
(Thompson, 2014), contradicts to nullify the remark of Social Actor
1. The lexeme, But, reveals to viewers that something else
is missing despite that people brush their teeth every morning.
The mislaid substance, in Social Actor 2’s point of view,
is the breath feeling that doesn’t last. The breath feeling
derived from the toothpaste is the core selling point of
Oral-B at this point in time. Such an argument indicts
other toothpaste products that lack a great quality of a
lasting breath feeling that characterizes the mouth of human beings.
By implication, Oral-B sustains fresh breath feeling, unlike other toothpastes,
in the users’ mouths for 14 hours, as revealed latter
in the communication hemispheres of O- BT24 to O-BT27.
