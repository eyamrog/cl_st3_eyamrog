Finally, being encouraged to gesture about a problem can help
students activate any implicit ideas they have about that problem.
This activation, in turn, can make them more open to
new instructions (Goldin-Meadow, 2017). Therefore, gestures not only reflect thinking
but also have the potential to change thinking in listeners
and speakers. The gesture is a tool that students, teachers,
and researchers can use to make discoveries about the mind.
