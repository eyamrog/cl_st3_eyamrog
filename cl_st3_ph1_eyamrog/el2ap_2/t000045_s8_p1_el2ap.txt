In Brazilian politics, it is common for politicians located at
different levels of the political system to cooperate among themselves
to achieve objectives either in the electoral competition or in
the governing arena. This cooperation can be seen in the
alliances between legislators (state and federal) and mayors and councilors,
which can be formal and restricted to the electoral period
(the so-called dobradas1) or informal alliances that go beyond elections.
In this relationship, local politicians are usually seen as brokers,
a term used in the literature to designate actors who
mediate between politicians and voters.2
