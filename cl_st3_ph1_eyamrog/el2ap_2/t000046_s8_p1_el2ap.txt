Bracht (2013) and Rufino and Darido (2013) indicate that Physical
Education (PE) has always approached health. Until the 1980s, PE
has aimed to fitness and movement, using gymnastic methods and
sport, acting on the health of students in an instrumental
perspective (PAIVA et al., 2017). In our study, we conceived
it as a traditional PE model.
