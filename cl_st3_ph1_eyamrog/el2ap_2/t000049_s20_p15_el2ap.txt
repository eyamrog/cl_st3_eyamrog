Similar considerations can be made regarding the identification of articulated2
epistemic behaviour: complex attitudes perpetrated by the children to investigate
an observed phenomenon. In particular, the analysis of the data
collected highlighted that children belonging to groups A and B
(‘promotion from within’ approach) had different epistemic behaviour (A and
B=11) – connected with the scientific investigation – (exploration, experimentation,
identification of the issue) to deepen their knowledge concerning the
same phenomenon. Once again, group C showed less quantity (C=4)
and complexity (constructing and exploration) regarding behaviors aimed at learning
following a scientific investigation method. The tables reported below show
the quantity and quality of the articulated epistemic behaviours to
investigate the different phenomena observed.
