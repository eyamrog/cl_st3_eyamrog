Our analysis supports the idea that local politicians, namely mayors
and city councilors, play the role of brokers and are
important points of support for state legislators. We also observed
that, in general, financial resources and assistance in solving problems
with state agencies are the most valued aids (Bezerra, 1999;
Meireles, 2019), but that councilors and mayors differ in their
demands and in how they are met. Fulfilling their requests
is the primary way in which representatives nurture the alliances
and, in this sense, legislators' actions and their offices are
predominantly reactive.
