Considering the aforementioned information and allied to the conception of
school as a sociocultural space (DAYRELL, 1996), in which there
are several perspectives of education and life, and of a
space of sociability, which, from the perspective of Gusm√£o (2003),
is configured as a space of encounters and mismatches, searches
and losses, discoveries and cover-ups, we believe that our findings
are configured in the emergence of the diversity of perceptions
on PE within the school.
