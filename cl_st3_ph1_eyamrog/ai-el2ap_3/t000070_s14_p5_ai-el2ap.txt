Germination percentage and germination speed index (GSI) data were collected
daily for 15 days of cultivation. Seeds were classified as
germinated when they exhibited embryo swelling, rupture of the seminal
envelope, and a light green coloration indicative of active metabolism.
The GSI was calculated following the method described by Maguire
(1962), using the formula GSI = âˆ‘ (Gi/ni), where Gi
represents the number of seeds germinated on a given day
and ni denotes the corresponding day of counting.
