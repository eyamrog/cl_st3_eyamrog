The findings related to gender are consistent with those reported
by Yasenov (2020), Gallacher and Hossain (2020), and Brussevich et
al. (2020), while the results concerning race align with those
of Yasenov (2020). In terms of age, a significant difference
was observed only among individuals aged 16 to 19 years.
The observation that young workers have lower participation in remote
work is well-documented in the literature (Brussevich et al., 2020;
Gallacher and Hossain, 2020; Yasenov, 2020).
