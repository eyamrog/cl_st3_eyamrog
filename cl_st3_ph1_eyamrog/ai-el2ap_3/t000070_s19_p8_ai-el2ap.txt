The aleurone layer, which surrounds both the endosperm and the
embryo, consists of a single layer of cells characterized by
thick cell walls and the presence of acid polysaccharides in
both the cytoplasm and the cell wall (Figure 1c, indicated
by the arrow). Additionally, starch grains were absent in the
cytoplasm of the aleurone layer.
