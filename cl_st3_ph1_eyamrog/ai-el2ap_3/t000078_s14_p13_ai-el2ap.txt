We utilized multiple databases for this study. In the first
stage of estimation, employment data from the Annual Social Information
Report (RAIS – Relação Anual de Informações Sociais), produced by
the Ministry of Labor, was used to identify the SBD.
RAIS includes all formally established (incorporated) organizations, both public and
private, as well as workers with a labor card, and
is regarded as a census of formal workers. However, RAIS
is limited to the formal labor market, which constitutes a
limitation of our analysis, as informal employment is not captured.
According to the National Household Sample Survey (PNAD – Pesquisa
Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios), formal employment accounted for 66%
of the labor force in the Metropolitan Area of São
Paulo in 2013. The geocoding of firms and the aggregation
of workers by Census tracts were performed by the Municipal
Secretariat for Urban Development (SMDU – Secretaria Municipal de Desenvolvimento
Urbano) of the Municipality of São Paulo (MSP). The MSP
comprises 310 Census tracts, as defined by the Brazilian Institute
of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).
