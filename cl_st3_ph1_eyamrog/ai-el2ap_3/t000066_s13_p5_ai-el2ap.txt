From the perspective of Critical Collaborative Research (PCcol) (Magalh√£es, 2009),
this approach is conceptualized as an intervention in practice, wherein
participants actively contribute to the production of knowledge. PCcol emphasizes
voluntary engagement, fosters critical participation, and incorporates multiple perspectives within
the research context. The inclusion of diverse viewpoints in collaborative
processes generates contradictions and tensions, which are considered essential for
facilitating critical reflection and potential transformation of the context. The
confrontations that arise within social relations are mediated and justified
through language, which constitutes a central focus in Applied Linguistics
studies. This collaborative approach underscores an engaged stance through collective
work, resulting from the combined efforts of all participants.
