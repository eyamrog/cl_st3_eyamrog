In this section, I conduct a thematic analysis of the
speech, identifying both explicit and implicit discourses. I employ various
appraisal strategies to demonstrate how Scholz manages dialogic space through
engagement, expanding or contracting discussion around these discourses, and how
he utilizes them to position himself and justify prospective policies.
In the subsequent section, I present an overview and interpretation
of the interaction among these discourses from a dialogic perspective,
focusing on the dynamics between centripetal and centrifugal discourses.
