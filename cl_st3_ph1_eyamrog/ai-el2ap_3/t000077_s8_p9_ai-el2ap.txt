This study seeks to provide a detailed analysis of the
characteristics of workers who engaged in remote work in Brazil,
with a focus on the extent of inequality in the
probability of working from home across various sociodemographic and occupational
groups. Utilizing data from the PNAD COVID-19 survey collected between
May and August 2020, the research employs both descriptive statistics
and econometric methods, specifically estimating Probit regression models, to examine
these disparities.
