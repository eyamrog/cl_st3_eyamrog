In the first stage, the analysis identifies tract areas that
form statistically significant clusters using the Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis
(ESDA) approach. The classification of these tract areas as spatially
bounded districts (SBD) is subsequently validated through the application of
the hedonic price model. In the second stage, the identification
strategy incorporates spatial data on real estate for each year.
Amenities such as schools, parks, and hospitals, as well as
transportation infrastructure including subways, trains, and major roads, were geocoded.
The geocoded data enable the identification of the locations of
properties, amenities, and transportation infrastructure within the city, and facilitate
the calculation of the Euclidean distance from each property to
the nearest public amenities and transportation options within the municipality.
