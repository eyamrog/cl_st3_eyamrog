Consequently, based on the two findings discussed above, access to
international financial markets for emerging economies is characterized by interruptions
and reversals, which negatively impact economic activity in these countries,
as demonstrated by Rodrik and Velasco (1999), Calvo et al.
(2004), and Edwards (2007). Furthermore, these dynamics lead to a
reduction in monetary policy autonomy for emerging economies, thereby challenging
the validity of the impossible trinity.
