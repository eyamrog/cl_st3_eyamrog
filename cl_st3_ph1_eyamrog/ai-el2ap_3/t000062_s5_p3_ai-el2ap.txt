The statistical analysis indicates that there are no significant differences
among the treatments with respect to spider diversity. However, the
two most abundant spider families were predominantly collected from distinct
areas. Previous research has shown that substantial variations in temperature
and humidity do not affect the distribution of spider assemblages
(Maciel 2011). In contrast, leaf architecture may influence different spider
guilds in various ways, even if it does not affect
the distribution of their prey (Diniz 2011).
