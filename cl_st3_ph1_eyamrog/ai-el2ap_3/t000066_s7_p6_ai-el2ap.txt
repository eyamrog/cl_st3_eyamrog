In this context, two Brazilian higher education professors, members of
the LACE Research Group, joined the GPB as Brigadiers and
organized a workshop designed to provide their university students with
opportunities to practice English language skills and engage in discussions
with professionals from other countries. Participants were also encouraged to
explore potential avenues for global collaboration, with particular attention to
the ongoing global crisis and its varied impacts. The workshop,
conducted in July via Zoom, involved approximately fifteen participants who
shared their personal and professional experiences through interactive activities and
discussions over the course of one hour.
