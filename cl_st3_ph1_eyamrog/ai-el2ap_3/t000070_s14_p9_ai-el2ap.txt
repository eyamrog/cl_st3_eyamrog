Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was conducted on seeds from
each treatment group. Samples were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in
0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.2 M
sucrose at 4 °C overnight. This was followed by five
washes in 0.3 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) with
0.6 M sucrose and water, with the sucrose concentration reduced
by 25% in each wash. Samples were then post-fixed in
2% osmium tetroxide and 0.2 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH
7.2) in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio for 4 hours at
room temperature. Dehydration was performed using a graded acetone series
(30–100% v/v), followed by pre-infiltration in graded mixtures of acetone
and Spurr resin (ratios of 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, and
1:3), and final infiltration in pure Spurr resin. Ultrathin sections
(60–90 nm) were prepared using a Power Tome XL ultramicrotome
with a diamond knife, and sections were stained with 1%
uranyl acetate and 1% lead citrate. Images were acquired using
a Jeol JEM1011 transmission electron microscope (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan)
at CEML-UFSC, and relevant observations were documented in micrographs.
