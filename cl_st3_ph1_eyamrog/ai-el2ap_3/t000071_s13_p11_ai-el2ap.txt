We analyzed the overlap among journals utilizing OJS that are
listed on both Beall’s and Cabell’s lists (Table 4). Our
results indicate that 82 journals, representing 0.3 percent of the
total OJS journals, are included on both lists, with the
majority published in India and the United States. In total,
521 journals using OJS are present on at least one
of the two predatory journal lists, corresponding to 2.0 percent
of all known OJS journals. Comparison of the two lists
suggests that Cabell’s list includes a relatively higher proportion of
journals from the Global South, and observed differences in country
representation between the lists are likely attributable to the composition
of publishers’ journal portfolios.
