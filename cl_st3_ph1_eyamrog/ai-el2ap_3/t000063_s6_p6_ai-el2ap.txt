This potential positive outcome of the pandemic may contribute to
the emergence of a new generation of scientists, physicians, and
health workers. Additionally, it presents an opportunity for science communication
professionals to increase their engagement with the general public, for
scientists to maintain and expand their outreach to broader audiences,
and for educators to promote science literacy and scientific thinking
among students.
