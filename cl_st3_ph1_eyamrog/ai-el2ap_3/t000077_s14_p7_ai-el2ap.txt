The variables presented in Table 2 were selected to align
with the study’s objective of examining inequalities in the probabilities
of remote work based on various socioeconomic and occupational characteristics.
The selection process was informed by both foundational literature on
labor market dynamics—including Mincer (1962) on labor force participation, Heckman
(1974) on shadow prices and market wages, and Mincer (1974)
and Willis (1986) on earnings functions—and recent empirical studies addressing
labor market issues in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic,
such as Bridi (2020), Mattei and Heinen (2020), Pouliakas (2020),
Yasenov (2020), Al Masri et al. (2021), Corseuil et al.
(2021), and Góes et al. (2021).
