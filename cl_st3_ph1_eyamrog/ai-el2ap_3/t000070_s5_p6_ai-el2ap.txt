Several studies have reported increased seed germination percentages following cryopreservation
in various species, suggesting that exposure to ultra-low temperatures during
the cooling process may contribute to the breaking of seed
dormancy. For instance, Rocha et al. (2009) observed that cryopreservation
of Gossypium hirsutum L. seeds resulted in higher germination rates
and improved seedling vigor. Similarly, Tarr√© et al. (2007) reported
that cryopreservation led to an increased germination percentage in E.
subsecundum (Baker) Mez seeds with a moisture content of 12.7%.
