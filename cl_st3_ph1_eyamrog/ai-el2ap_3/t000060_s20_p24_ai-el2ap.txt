Combined with the discourse marker "well," the Judge employs the
hedge "technically" in the phrase "Well, technically," which serves as
a mitigation device. This hedge functions to reduce the speaker's
commitment to the statement, thereby minimizing potential threats to the
speaker's face. By softening the assertiveness of the statement, it
decreases the risk of negative social consequences and facilitates a
more favorable interpretation by the listener.
