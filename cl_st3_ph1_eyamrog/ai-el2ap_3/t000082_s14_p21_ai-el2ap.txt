This study investigates the impact of varying frequencies of cheating
interactions on coevolutionary dynamics. Specifically, it examines how changes in
the prevalence of cheating behaviors influence the evolutionary trajectories of
both cheaters and their cooperative counterparts. By systematically manipulating the
frequency of cheating within experimental or simulated populations, the research
aims to elucidate the mechanisms by which these interactions shape
adaptive responses, genetic diversity, and the stability of cooperative systems
over time. The findings are expected to contribute to a
more comprehensive understanding of the role of cheating in the
evolution of interdependent biological relationships.
