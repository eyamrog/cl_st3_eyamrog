The Annonaceae family comprises approximately 2,500 species that occur naturally
or are cultivated in tropical regions of the Americas, Asia,
and Madagascar (Gonz√°lez 2013), with a significant proportion of these
species being native to Latin America, particularly Ecuador, Peru, and
Brazil. Despite this geographic distribution, the majority of research on
the antitumor potential of acetogenins and their pharmacological applications has
been conducted in laboratories located in Europe, the United States,
and Asia.
