In the classroom, the teacher provides instructions on what tasks
to complete and how to perform them. In contrast, participation
in scientific initiation has encouraged me to experiment with new
methods and to engage directly with the research process. While
my advisor offers support and addresses any questions I may
have, the responsibility for determining the direction and subsequent steps
of the research lies with me, a level of autonomy
that is not typically afforded in the classroom setting. (USResearcher
