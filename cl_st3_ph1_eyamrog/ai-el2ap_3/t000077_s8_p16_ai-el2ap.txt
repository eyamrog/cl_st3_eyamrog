Gallacher and Hossain (2020) found that, in Canada, 41% of
jobs could be performed remotely. Their analysis indicated that individuals
with a lower likelihood of engaging in remote work were
more likely to be poorer, younger, non-immigrant, single, male, and/or
lacking a college education. Additionally, these individuals were more frequently
employed in the private sector, in small firms, and in
positions characterized as seasonal, contractual, or part-time.
