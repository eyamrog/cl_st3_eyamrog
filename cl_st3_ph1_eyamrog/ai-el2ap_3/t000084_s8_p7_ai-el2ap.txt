Guided by the Community of Inquiry (CoI) model, this embedded
correlational study aims to: a) identify the types of emojis
used to support cognitive, teaching, and social presences in an
eight-week continuing education course on mobile device and application use
via WhatsApp; b) examine the relationship between participants’ attitudes and
their use of emojis for cognitive, teaching, and social presences
during the course; and c) analyze the extent to which
participants’ age and gender are associated with and may account
for their emoji use. To contextualize these objectives, this paper
provides a concise overview of the CoI model.
