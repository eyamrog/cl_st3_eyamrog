This species can negatively affect plant populations, including Cucumis sativus
L., as well as animal species such as Formicivora paludicola
Buzzetti et al. 2014 (Rodrigues & Lopes 2006; Del-Rio 2014).
The rapid propagation of this species is further facilitated by
the absence of a known effective predator. However, Castro (2013)
documented the first instance of herbivory, thereby establishing H. coronarium
as a food source for Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris Linnaeus 1766.
