In the present study, seeds collected at 120 days after
anthesis (DAA) exhibited a lower average germination percentage (70%) compared
to those collected during the desiccation period at 150 DAA,
which showed a germination percentage of 89.6% (Table 1). The
cryogenic process did not significantly affect seed germination capacity. However,
seed moisture content was identified as a critical factor influencing
both survival and germination. Specifically, cryopreservation of IpÃª-Roxo (Tabebuia impetiginosa
(Mart. ex DC.) Standl.) seeds with moisture contents of 12.5%,
8.4%, and 4.2% preserved seed vigour and germination capacity, whereas
a moisture content of 18.3% resulted in reduced germination rates
(Martins et al., 2009).
