More specifically, this activity provided participants with the opportunity to
voluntarily share personal information with the group and to respond
to others' disclosures by choosing whether or not to turn
on their cameras. This action, or the decision to refrain
from it, served as a nonverbal indicator of identification or
differentiation with the shared experiences. Through this process, participants were
exposed to a range of personal characteristics and were able
to express the extent to which they related to these
traits, thereby reflecting on their own subjectivity in a shared
context (Sawaia, 2018).
