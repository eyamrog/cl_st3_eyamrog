Romanos (1979) argues that rent prices tend to be underestimated
in areas where sub-centers are present. Furthermore, many cities contain
more than one business center or multiple sub-centers. In contrast
to the predictions of monocentric models, where the property price
gradient is expected to decrease monotonically with distance from the
central business district (CBD), the polycentric model suggests that this
gradient does not necessarily follow a monotonic decline.
