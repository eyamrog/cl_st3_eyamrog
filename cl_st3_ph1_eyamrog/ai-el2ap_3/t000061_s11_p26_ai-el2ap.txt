The USR experience provides a valuable opportunity to facilitate the
understanding of metaphysical concepts by enabling their visualization through concrete
actions. This is particularly significant from an educational perspective, as
moral concepts, due to their metaphysical nature, cannot be objectively
known (Lavelle, 2018), which presents considerable challenges for researchers in
training. Accordingly, USR aligns with what Benjamin described as the
"experience of thought," wherein the visualization of meaningful images supports
conceptual understanding. Thus, the USR experience enables novice researchers to
observe moral behaviors and develop mental representations of the application
of ethical concepts in practical contexts, such as responding to
specific ethical dilemmas.
