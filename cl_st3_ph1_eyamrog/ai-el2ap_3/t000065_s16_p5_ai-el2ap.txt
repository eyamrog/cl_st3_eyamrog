CorIFA consists of texts produced by undergraduate and graduate students
from various programs at the Federal University of Minas Gerais.
These students are enrolled in one of five English for
Academic Purposes (IFA) courses, which were established in 2012 as
part of broader efforts to promote and strengthen the university’s
internationalisation. Enrollment in these courses is determined by students’ English
proficiency levels, which range from intermediate to advanced (B1–C1) according
to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. As
a component of course assessment, students at each proficiency level
are required to produce texts in a designated academic register
(see Table 1). Prior to enrollment in an IFA course,
students’ proficiency levels are verified either through submission of standardized
test scores, such as TOEFL or IELTS, or by taking
an internal placement test.
