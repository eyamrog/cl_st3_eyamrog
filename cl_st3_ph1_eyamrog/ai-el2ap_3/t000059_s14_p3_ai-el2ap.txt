Authorship concentration at the journal level over the five-year period
was measured using two indicators: the percentage of articles published
by the most prolific author and the Gini coefficient. For
each journal, the most prolific author was defined as the
individual who published the highest number of articles in that
journal during the study period. The percentage was calculated as
the ratio of articles authored by this individual to the
total number of signed articles in the journal. The Gini
coefficient, which ranges from zero (indicating complete equality) to one
(indicating complete inequality), was calculated according to the method described
by Jasso (1979). For a discussion of the comparative advantages
of different Gini coefficient calculation methods, see Davidson (2009).
