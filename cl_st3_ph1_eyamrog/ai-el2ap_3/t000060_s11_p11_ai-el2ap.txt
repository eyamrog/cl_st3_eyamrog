In the example above, the delay in the response suggests
that the initial utterance does not automatically elicit the anticipated
second part from the interlocutor. According to Yule (1996, p.
78), a delay in response indicates the potential unavailability of
an immediate and typically automatic reply. Such delays are interpreted
as significant, as they highlight a discrepancy between what is
expected and what is actually provided in the interaction.
