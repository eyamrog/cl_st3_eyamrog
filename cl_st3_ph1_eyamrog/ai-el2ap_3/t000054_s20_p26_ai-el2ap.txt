The implementation of an economic model based on the rational
use of biodiversity has the potential to enhance the health
of terrestrial ecosystems and support the long-term preservation of life.
As noted by Philp (2015), the current model's unsustainable practices
are incompatible with the continued maintenance of life over extended
periods.
