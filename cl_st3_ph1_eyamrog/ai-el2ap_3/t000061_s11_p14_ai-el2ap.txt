Imagination, defined as the capacity to generate mental images, is
supported by the archaic ability to interpret objects directly, prior
to the mediation of language (Freitas, 2008, p. 365). It
is important to note that Benjamin employs the term "archaic"
to refer both to the origins of humanity and history,
as well as to the developmental stage in which a
child learns about the world and undergoes socialization in preparation
for adult life (Schlesener, 2019, p. 256). In both contexts,
imitation is deliberately employed as a means of facilitating integration
into the world.
