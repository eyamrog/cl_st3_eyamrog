This analysis identifies a latent regime change in the discourse
on Russia, observable at the level of implicit or unarticulated
meanings. Evidence for this shift can be found in statements
noting that protests against "Putin’s war" have occurred in many
Russian cities, with participants described as demonstrating "great courage and
true bravery," and in expressions of solidarity with those in
Russia who "are boldly defying Putin’s regime and opposing his
war against Ukraine." Despite the overall preference for dialogic contraction
in Scholz’s speech, there is a significant use of dialogically
expansive strategies in this context, as seen in remarks such
as "we should not forget" the protests and the assertion,
"I am quite sure that freedom, tolerance and human rights
will prevail in Russia, too." This language, while acknowledging the
existence of protest and the values of freedom and human
rights, also implicitly allows for the argument that the Russian
population supports Putin and that these values are not currently
realized in Russia. Such an implication constitutes a strong and
unsubstantiated claim, which has previously been employed by Western actors
to justify military interventions in other countries.
