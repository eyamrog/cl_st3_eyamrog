Upon returning to the main room, participants discussed the identities
of the guests they had interacted with and shared additional
information they had learned. During this segment of the workshop,
facilitators invited selected guests to share their responses to the
question, "Global collaboration: what can young professionals do?" This was
intended to expand the discussion on various approaches to enacting
global collaboration, encompassing diverse modes of communication, emotional engagement, action,
and participation in the world.
