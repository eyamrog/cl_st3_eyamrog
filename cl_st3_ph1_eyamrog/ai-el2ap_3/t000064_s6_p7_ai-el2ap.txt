Anatomical immaturity is associated with the underdevelopment of the photosynthetic
apparatus. In this study, the in vitro plantlets exhibited an
inability to achieve net carbon assimilation, along with elevated leaf
transpiration rates, which suggests stomatal dysfunction. The light intensity required
for optimal leaf development varies among species; an intensity sufficient
for one species may be inadequate for another. For example,
when compared to other Cerrado species cultivated in vitro, Lippia
rotundifolia develops leaves capable of net carbon assimilation under a
photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) of 78 µmol m⁻² s⁻¹ (Hsie
et al. 2019), whereas Hanconia speciosa and Hyptis marrubioides demonstrate
carbon assimilation at a PAR of 50 µmol m⁻² s⁻¹
(Costa et al. 2014).
