Garrison et al. (1999) define social presence as "the ability
of participants in a community of inquiry to project themselves
socially and emotionally, as 'real' people (i.e., their full personality),
through the medium of communication being used" (p. 94). Indicators
of social presence in online text-based communication include the expression
of emotions, the ability to express oneself without risk, the
promotion of group cohesion, the acknowledgment of others, and the
encouragement of collaboration, as summarized in Table 1.
