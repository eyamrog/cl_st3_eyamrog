By including all SBD candidates in the econometric estimation, the
analysis accounts for the possibility of cross-commuting, whereby workers may
select more distant business centers despite the presence of closer
alternatives (Plaut and Plaut, 1988; Wrede, 2015). This approach offers
greater flexibility compared to models that restrict workers to choosing
only the nearest business center to their residence, as proposed
by Fujita and Ogawa (1982) and Baumont, Ertur, and Gallo
(2004).
