This unequal capacity to work from home across various occupations,
positions, or functions raises concerns about inequality, as these categories
systematically differ in the representation of socially vulnerable groups of
workers. Preliminary evidence presented in Figure 1 indicates that low-income
workers were more likely to confront the trade-off between maintaining
employment and facing health risks, whereas higher-income workers had greater
access to remote work options. To further investigate this finding,
Figure 2 displays the proportion of remote work by position
within the earnings distribution.
