Interaction inherently involves the potential for conflict; therefore, a necessary
condition for its harmonious progression is that participants, as noted
by Belchí (1994, p. 343), "preserve the interlocutor’s face in
order to maintain a balance between the desire to approach
and the respect for the other’s intimacy" (our translation).
