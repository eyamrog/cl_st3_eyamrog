Another element from informal conversation is the marker "I mean."
In the example above, this device is used by the
speaker to guide the listener toward a specific interpretation. This
metalinguistic form of modalization is closely related to discourse practices
and the representation of speech. The speaker highlights the manner
in which information is conveyed, thereby directing or redirecting the
listener to a particular intended meaning. By using "I mean,"
speakers attempt to focus the listener's attention on information that
is more relevant or advantageous to their communicative goals. With
respect to the markers "well" and "you know," the same
functions identified in Excerpt 4 are observed, in addition to
the hedging function performed by "technically."
