The transition from the in vitro phase to the rooting
phase represents a critical bottleneck in seedling production, as seedlings
previously grown under heterotrophic conditions and low light intensities must
adapt to an environment that requires full autotrophic growth (Kaur
2015). In the protocol described by Neto (2009), this transition
resulted in a loss of approximately 55% of the seedlings;
however, survival rates increased to about 95% once the seedlings
successfully acclimatized and were grown under greenhouse conditions, indicating that
those surviving this phase could subsequently be cultivated outdoors. For
comparison, in the micropropagation protocol for the Cerrado species Jacaranda
ulei Bureau & K. Schum., the survival rate during the
transition from the in vitro to the rooting phase was
approximately 80% (Silveira et al. 2018).
