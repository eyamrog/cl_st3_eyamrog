Cheating interactions contribute to increased community-level trait disparity in mutualistic
networks. By imposing selection that favors trait mismatching, the presence
of cheating interactions results in greater species trait disparity. This
dynamic partially counteracts the selection pressures that promote convergence and
trait matching in mutualisms (Guimar√£es et al. 2011, Zhang et
al. 2012). Consequently, cheating interactions may help explain mechanisms that
prevent perfect trait matching in empirical mutualistic communities (Law et
al. 2001). However, the increase in trait disparity is constrained
by environmental pressures and distinct selection regimes (Andreazzi et al.
2017). For example, limited genetic variation or anatomical and physiological
constraints can restrict traits such as fruit sugar content and
flower size (Jordano 1995), thereby limiting the potential for trait
matching. Additionally, annual variation in soil nutrients can affect the
pulp composition of fleshy fruits, restricting the development of sugar-rich
fruits that are highly attractive to frugivores (Herrera 1998), and
thus further limiting trait matching in plant-frugivore systems.
