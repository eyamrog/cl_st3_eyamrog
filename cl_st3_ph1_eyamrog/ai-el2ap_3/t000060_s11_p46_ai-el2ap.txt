Individuals exist within a social environment characterized by interactions with
others. During these interactions, individuals typically express their opinions, judgments,
and perspectives, thereby enacting what Goffman (1974, p. 9) refers
to as a "line," defined as a pattern of verbal
and nonverbal behaviors through which a person communicates their interpretation
of the situation and their evaluation of the participants, particularly
themselves. Through this process, individuals convey assessments of both themselves
and others, with the line serving as a representation of
self-perception. Furthermore, the line adopted by an individual is generally
aligned with the image they wish to project to others.
