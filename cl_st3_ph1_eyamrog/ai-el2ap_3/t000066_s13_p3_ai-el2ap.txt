The three Brazilian professors who organized the workshop invited young
professionals from various fields to participate as guests. Several of
these professionals were residing abroad, enabling them to provide informed
responses to the central question of the workshop: "What can
young professionals do?" The remaining participants, primarily the professors' university
students who were intermediate English learners, were involved in a
play session. This session differed significantly from their typical classroom
experience, as it offered a less restrictive environment for language
practice, allowing for greater autonomy and risk-taking.
