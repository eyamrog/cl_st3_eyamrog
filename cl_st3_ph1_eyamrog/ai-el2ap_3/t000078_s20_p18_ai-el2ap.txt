A descriptive analysis of housing prices, employment specialization, wages, and
education offers a comprehensive understanding of each SBD, highlighting the
heterogeneity among sub-centers. Across all identified SBDs, the average housing
price per square meter is R$ 8,230.00, with a standard
deviation of R$ 2,295.00. Housing prices are highest in Pinheiros
compared to other sub-centers. As shown in Figure 4, there
is a positive correlation between average housing prices per square
meter and distance from the CBD, which contrasts with the
negative correlation predicted by monocentric models. This observed pattern supports
the existence of sub-centers within the urban structure.
