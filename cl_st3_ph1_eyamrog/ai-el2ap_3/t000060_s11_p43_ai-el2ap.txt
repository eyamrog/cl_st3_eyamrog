Drew (2003, p. 296) states that formulations serve specific interactional
functions that differ depending on the context in which they
occur. While formulations represent a general mechanism within interaction, their
forms and uses are shaped by the particular activities they
facilitate in given situations. Consequently, these devices are multifunctional, fulfilling
a range of interactional roles across various contexts.
