Species of the genus Vellozia produce a large quantity of
small seeds that are wind-dispersed, exhibit resistance to high temperatures,
and demonstrate rapid and high rates of germination (Menezes 1977;
Oliveira et al. 1991; Garcia & Diniz 2003; Palhares 2004;
Garcia et al. 2007; Jacobi & Sarto 2007; Mota &
Garcia 2013; Vieira et al. 2017). However, Alves (1994) reported
that Vellozia species exhibit very slow growth rates, ranging from
approximately 0.5 to 2.0 cm per year, and that juvenile
plants are rarely observed in the field, despite the high
frequency of adults in the Campo Rupestre. Individuals measuring between
1.80 and 3.30 m in height were determined to be
several centuries old, indicating that, although these plants are common
in open fields, they are not pioneer species but rather
establish later in the successional sequence as climax species (Alves
1994).
