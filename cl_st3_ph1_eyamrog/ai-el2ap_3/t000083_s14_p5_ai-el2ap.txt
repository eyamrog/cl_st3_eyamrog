For the pilot study, it is recommended to administer the
translated and adapted questionnaire to a small subset of the
target population, typically between 30 and 40 individuals, in order
to identify potential difficulties in comprehension. During this phase, operational
equivalence was also assessed, which pertains to the practical aspects
of questionnaire administration, including the format of the questions (e.g.,
online or paper-based) and the mode of administration (e.g., self-completed
or interviewer-administered). Following the cross-cultural adaptation of the SBS, the
instrument was implemented using the Google Forms platform, and a
link was distributed to facilitate data collection from a pilot
sample of 45 adolescents aged 12 to 18 years. In
addition to completing the questionnaire, participants were asked to rate
the ease or difficulty of understanding each item and were
provided with an open field to offer suggestions.
