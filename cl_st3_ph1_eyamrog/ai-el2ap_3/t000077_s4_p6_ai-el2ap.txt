Therefore, the pandemic, through the expansion of remote work opportunities,
contributed to widening existing labor market inequalities by disproportionately benefiting
wealthier, more educated, and more formally employed workers, while compelling
others to choose between maintaining employment and income or facing
increased risk of contagion. The findings of this study offer
important insights for policymakers, as the labor market effects of
the pandemic are likely to persist, at least in part,
even after the resumption of regular economic activity.
