To account for urban infrastructure, we calculate the minimum Euclidean
distance from each property to various transportation sites, including train
and subway stations, main avenues, bus corridors, and highways, as
well as to a range of amenities such as urban
parks, libraries, cultural centers, art galleries, theaters, concert halls, cinemas,
shopping malls, race stadiums, resorts, sports centers, clubs, sports courts,
soccer stadiums, elementary and high schools, hospitals, health centers, and
favelas.
