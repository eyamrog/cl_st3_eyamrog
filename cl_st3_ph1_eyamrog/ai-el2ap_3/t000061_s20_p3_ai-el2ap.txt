Undergraduate Scientific Research (USR) provides valuable opportunities for undergraduates who
are beginning to engage in academic research and seeking to
enhance their training experience. It highlights the significance and complexity
of scientific research in the development of rigorous and well-substantiated
knowledge, while also promoting ongoing learning both during and after
formal education. Experience with USR further indicates the necessity of
commitment and a supportive environment, as multiple factors influence effective
engagement in academic research, including the availability of resources, scholarship
support, constructive advisor-advisee interactions, and the recognition of the field
and training (USResearcher 02, Questionnaire, 2021).
