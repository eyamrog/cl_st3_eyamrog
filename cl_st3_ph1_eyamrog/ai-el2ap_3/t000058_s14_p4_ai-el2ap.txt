Only data from dry-preserved male and female culicids mounted with
entomological pins were included in the dataset. Information for each
specimen was recorded in a spreadsheet using Microsoft OfficeÂ® v.
2016 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) and subsequently transferred to
a Darwin Core-compliant spreadsheet.
