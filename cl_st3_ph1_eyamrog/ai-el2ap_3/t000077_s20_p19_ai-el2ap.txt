This analysis employs Probit models to estimate the likelihood of
remote work, with results presented as marginal effects for conditional
probabilities in Table 3. Column (1) reports estimates from a
model without controls for federation units, months, or the 36
labor activity categories. Columns (2) through (4) sequentially introduce fixed
effects for these variables, with column (4) incorporating all fixed
effects. The full Probit model estimates are provided in Table
A2.
