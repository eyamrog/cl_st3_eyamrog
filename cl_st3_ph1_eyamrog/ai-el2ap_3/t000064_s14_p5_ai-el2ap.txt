After each change in light intensity, the IRGA was programmed
to record values only after stabilization had occurred. In half
of the measurements, the light response curve was generated by
increasing light intensity, while in the other half, it was
generated by decreasing light intensity. For plants grown under open
conditions (garden and control group at the ecological park), measurements
were conducted between 09:00 and 10:00 AM during the rainy
season. In addition to the A/light response curve, gas exchange
rates were also measured under natural light conditions, with an
intensity of approximately 2,200 µmol m⁻² s⁻¹.
