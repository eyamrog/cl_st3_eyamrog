Benjamin (1987) examines mimesis primarily through texts concerning childhood, both
his own and in general, emphasizing the significance of this
developmental stage for the formation of rationality. According to Susan
Buck-Morss (1995: 288, own translation), "no modern thinker, with the
exception of Jean Piaget, has taken children more seriously in
developing a theory of cognition." While Piaget concentrated on the
cognitive benefits associated with the progressive development of abstract thinking
and regarded the use of fantastical explanations in childhood as
cognitive errors, Benjamin focused on the potential losses associated with
the gradual abandonment of mimetic behavior as individuals transition into
adulthood (Schlesener, 2019).
