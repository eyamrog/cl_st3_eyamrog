The utilitarian orientation of Western culture has led to the
transformation of various forms of life into biological resources for
scientific research and industrial production, as exemplified by the cases
of ayahuasca, the poison dart frog, and peyote. The processes
of appropriation extend beyond economic interests and encompass epistemological dimensions,
resulting in a delineation between scientific knowledge—produced through laboratory-based research—and
traditional knowledge systems.
