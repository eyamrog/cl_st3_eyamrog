Models employing a spatial statistical approach are based on Exploratory
Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA). This methodology enables the assessment of
spatial patterns in employment levels and densities. According to Baumont
et al. (2004), sub-centers are identified as areas exhibiting both
high employment levels and statistically significant employment densities.
