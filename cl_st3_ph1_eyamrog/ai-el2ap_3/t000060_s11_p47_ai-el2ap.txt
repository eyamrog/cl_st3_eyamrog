Regardless of an individual's intention to adopt a particular position,
he is likely to perceive that he has already done
so (cf. Goffman, 1974). According to Goffman (1974, p. 9),
other participants will generally assume that the individual has deliberately
taken a stance, and consequently, if he wishes to respond
to their reactions, he must consider the impressions they may
have formed of him.
