A total of 494 individuals representing 19 botanical families were
sampled, encompassing 30 genera and 40 morphospecies (Table 1). Among
the individuals identified to at least the family level, the
highest species diversity was observed in Asteraceae (17.5%), followed by
Moraceae (12.5%), Solanaceae (12.5%), and Urticaceae (7.5%). Some individuals could
not be reliably identified to the genus or species level
because they were not in a reproductive state, and the
vegetative characteristics observed were insufficient for definitive identification.
