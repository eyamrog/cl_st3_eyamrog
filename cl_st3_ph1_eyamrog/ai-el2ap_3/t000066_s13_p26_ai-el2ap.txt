We have been conducting online instruction; however, many students are
experiencing significant challenges due to job loss, resulting in financial
instability, housing insecurity, and food scarcity. In addition to teaching,
I have been assisting students in accessing food resources, securing
temporary housing, and applying for unemployment benefits to alleviate some
of their financial difficulties. These challenges have been particularly pronounced
among students of color, including Black and Latino students, who
are disproportionately affected compared to their white peers. This situation
has increased my workload as I strive to support my
students' well-being, and it has been difficult to disengage from
these responsibilities given the extent of their hardship.
