Corpus compilation is a complex research activity that has been
undertaken by numerous scholars. However, few learner corpora are readily
accessible (e.g., the International Corpus of Learner English), and none
currently include a range of text registers produced by English
learners at varying proficiency levels within the Brazilian university context.
The objective of this paper is to describe the compilation
of a learner corpus specifically designed to address the needs
of research and teaching in this context, highlighting the benefits
of such a resource for understanding learner needs and informing
pedagogical decisions based on empirical data. The article provides a
detailed rationale for the corpus compilation process and outlines the
methodological choices made to ensure the validity of comparative analyses.
To demonstrate the utility of a rigorously constructed corpus, findings
from previous studies are discussed. The conclusions emphasize the importance
of discipline-specific writing tasks for the development of writing proficiency
and the necessity of fostering authorship skills in English for
Academic Purposes courses to support academic achievement.
