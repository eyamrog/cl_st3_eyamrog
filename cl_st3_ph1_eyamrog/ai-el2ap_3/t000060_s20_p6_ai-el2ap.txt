Researchers examining legal discourse, as well as other institutional contexts
such as news interviews, have identified recurring patterns in the
design of questions that are associated with specific actions within
these settings. These include the use of "and-" and "so-"
prefaced questions (Johnson, 2002), formulations (Heritage & Watson, 1979; Heritage,
1985), and reported speech (Philips, 1986; Matoesian, 2000; Galatolo, 2007).
Such devices, which are frequently employed in questions and occasionally
in other segments of trial discourse (for example, the use
of reported speech during summing up), often play a central
role in achieving one of the primary objectives of legal
discourse: establishing the culpability of one or more parties involved.
