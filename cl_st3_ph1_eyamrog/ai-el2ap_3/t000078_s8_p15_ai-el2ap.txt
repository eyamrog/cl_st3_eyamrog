McMillen (2001a, 2001b) introduced a two-stage model that does not
require prior knowledge of the city under evaluation. In the
first stage, the method closely follows the approach of Craig
and Ng (2001) by regressing the logarithm of employment density
on the distance to the central business district (CBD). Subcenter
candidates are identified as locations where the residuals from this
regression form clusters that are statistically significant at the 5%
level. In the second stage, after identifying potential subcenters, a
semiparametric model is applied. The nonparametric component of this regression,
adjusted using a flexible Fourier approximation, employs the residuals from
the first stage as the dependent variable and the distance
to the CBD as the explanatory variable. Locations with statistically
significant estimated distance coefficients are classified as subcenters.
