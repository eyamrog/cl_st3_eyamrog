Cryopreservation is currently the only method that ensures the long-term
conservation of genetic material in a safe and cost-effective manner
(Engelmann 2011). Storage in liquid nitrogen at -196 Â°C halts
all metabolic activity and cell division, thereby preventing both the
degradation and contamination of the preserved material (Cruz-Cruz et al.
2013). Direct immersion in liquid nitrogen can be performed without
the use of cryoprotectants for materials that are tolerant to
low temperatures and have low moisture content, as demonstrated in
the present study and in previous research on Dyckia brevifolia
Beker and Dyckia delicata Larocca & Sobral seeds (De Paula
et al. 2020), mature seeds of Cattleya guttata Lindl (Vettorazzi
et al. 2019), and Passiflora edulis Sims seeds (Generoso et
al. 2019). Although no significant differences were observed between storage
treatments in the present study, cryopreservation is considered to offer
greater long-term benefits compared to conventional refrigeration, which may allow
for degradation and contamination of the material over the medium
term.
