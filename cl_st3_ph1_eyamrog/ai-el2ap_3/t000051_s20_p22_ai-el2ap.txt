Based on this conclusion, Scholz constructs a discourse that frames
national security as being under threat, characterized by its proximity,
latent nature, and potential to materialize in the near future.
The war in Ukraine is depicted without reference to its
historical context, instead being presented as an act of aggression
aimed at initiating imperial expansion that could eventually involve Germany.
This perceived threat to national security is articulated, first, through
the rhetorical question regarding the capabilities of Putin’s Russia and
what measures “we” must take “um dieser Bedrohung zu begegnen,
heute und in der Zukunft” (‘to counter this threat, today
and in the future’). This formulation indicates that Scholz anticipates
a protracted conflict with Russia, which may be used to
justify the (alleged) necessity for Germany to consider acquiring nuclear
weapons. The rhetorical question remains unanswered, and Scholz employs the
dialogically contractive statement “Klar ist” (‘it is clear’) to assert
that, above all, Germany must significantly increase investment in national
security to protect “unsere Freiheit und unsere Demokratie” (‘our freedom
and our democracy’). A second instance of the national security
threat discourse is evident in the implicit reference to Germany’s
role as a military power, as seen in the claim
that a functioning army is “ja wohl erreichbar für ein
Land unserer Größe und unserer Bedeutung in Europa” (‘quite certainly
something that a country of our size and our significance
within Europe should be able to achieve’).
