The study of the parasitic fauna of Lake Tanganyika began
with the description of Ancyrocephalus limnothrissae Paperna, 1973, identified from
the gills of Limnothrissa miodon (Boulenger, 1906). This species was
subsequently redescribed as Kapentagyrus limnothrissae by Kmentov√° et al. (2018).
The second monogenean species from Lake Tanganyika, belonging to the
genus Gyrodactylus, was described by Vanhove et al. (2011). Since
these initial studies, research on monogeneans in Lake Tanganyika has
expanded, with particular emphasis on Cichlidogyrus species parasitizing cichlid fishes.
Currently, 30 species of Cichlidogyrus have been formally described from
the lake, with an additional 10 species remaining undescribed (Rahmouni
2017, 2020, 2021).
