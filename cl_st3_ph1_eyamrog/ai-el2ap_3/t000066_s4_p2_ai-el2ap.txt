Within this context, this paper presents an initiative undertaken by
the GPB community, specifically an online play-and-talk workshop offered as
part of the groupâ€™s monthly events. The workshop addressed and
illustrated both theoretical and practical aspects of collaboration and play,
which are two fundamental concepts for this international group. Entitled
"Global Collaboration: What Can Young Professionals Do?", the workshop appears
to integrate these concepts in its organizational structure and activities,
with the aim of addressing challenges arising from the COVID-19
pandemic, which has also exacerbated other significant social issues.
