When asked to indicate in which context they believed greater
autonomy was developed, with two possible answers provided, 92.3% (n=24)
of respondents selected USR, while 7.7% (n=2) selected regular classes.
These results support the argument that providing opportunities within a
structured model does not promote passive student behavior; rather, the
model appears to facilitate the development of independent thought and
action. To further explore this perspective, respondents were subsequently asked
to explain, in an open-ended format, the reasons why one
context was perceived to foster greater autonomy than the other.
