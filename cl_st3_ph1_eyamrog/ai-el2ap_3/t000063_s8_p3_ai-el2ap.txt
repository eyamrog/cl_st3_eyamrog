This study aimed to determine whether the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic
influenced Mexican adolescents' perceptions of science, scientists, and health care
workers, whether it affected their career aspirations, and whether there
was an increase in first-year college applications and enrollment in
scientific and health care programs at Mexican universities.
