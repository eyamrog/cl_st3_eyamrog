Given the increasing prevalence of selfie-taking behavior among adolescents and
young adults, Balakrishnan and Griffiths (2017) developed the Selfitis Behavior
Scale (SBS). Psychometric evaluations of the SBS, including exploratory factor
analysis and assessments of internal consistency, have demonstrated satisfactory reliability
and validity in samples of university students from India, Iran,
Afghanistan (Lin et al., 2019), Turkey (Ciplak & Atici, 2021),
and Italy (Monacis et al., 2020).
