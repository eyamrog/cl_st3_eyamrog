Perceptions of science, scientists, and healthcare workers play a critical
role in shaping public attitudes toward scientific research and medical
practice. The appraisal of these groups is influenced by factors
such as trust in scientific institutions, the perceived credibility and
expertise of professionals, and the effectiveness of science communication. Understanding
how individuals evaluate science and healthcare professionals is essential for
developing strategies to enhance public engagement, improve health outcomes, and
foster informed decision-making regarding scientific and medical issues.
