In conclusion, this article has demonstrated the utility of Bakhtinian
dialogism in discourse analysis by operationalizing the concept of centripetal-centrifugal
struggle. The analysis illustrates how dominant, centralized discourses are mobilized
within political speech to exclude marginalized perspectives and to justify
significant shifts in foreign policy and military expenditure that were
previously considered untenable. This methodological approach is particularly effective for
global analyses in contexts where specific discourses and ideologies, predominantly
of Western origin, are often assumed to be normative.
