The moisture content (%) of the seeds was determined using
a composite sample of 1,000 seeds collected at different times.
The oven-drying method was applied at 105 ± 3 ºC
for 24 ± 1 hours, following the protocol established by
Brazil (2009), with four replicates of 200 seeds each. Moisture
content, expressed on a wet basis, was calculated using the
following formula: X% = [(Iw - Fw) / Iw] ×
100, where Iw represents the initial weight of the sample
(g), Fw is the final weight of the sample (g),
and X% denotes the water content as a percentage of
the wet basis.
