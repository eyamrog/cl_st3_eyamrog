Since then, the GPB has provided free Play and Talk
workshops in multiple languages and time zones worldwide. According to
the GPB Mission, these sessions are designed to facilitate opportunities
for participants to engage in play, improvisation, personal development, and
collaborative storytelling. The workshops serve as a platform for sharing
experiences and listening to others, particularly during periods of crisis.
The GPB has sought to include participants of all ages
in a virtual format, given the limitations on physical gatherings,
with the objective of fostering experiences of joy, pain, reflection,
creativity, and emotional connection through play. This approach aims to
enable participants to effect change in their immediate circumstances while
also contributing to longer-term positive outcomes.
