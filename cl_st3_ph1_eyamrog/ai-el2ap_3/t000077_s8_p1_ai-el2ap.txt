The first confirmed case of Covid-19 in Brazil occurred on
February 26, 2020. By early April 2021, the country had
reported over 13 million confirmed cases and more than 330,000
deaths (Brazil, 2021). The onset of the pandemic coincided with
a period in which Brazil was gradually recovering from its
most severe and prolonged recession since the Second World War
(Oreiro, 2017). In the second quarter of 2020, Brazil's GDP
declined by 9.7% compared to the previous quarter, representing the
largest decrease recorded since the beginning of the historical series
in 1996 (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics - IBGE/National
Accounts, 2020).
