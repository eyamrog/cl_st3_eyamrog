Professor Ana Leuch Lozovei served as a faculty member in
the Basic Pathology Department at the Federal University of Paran치,
where she taught Parasitology and Medical Entomology. She played a
significant role in the education and training of multiple generations
of professionals in health, natural sciences, and education who are
currently active throughout Brazil. Through her initiative, she established collections
of various taxonomic groups for didactic purposes. Over time, and
with the contributions of her postgraduate students, these collections acquired
increasing scientific value as knowledge in her areas of expertise
expanded. In particular, the Culicidae section of her collection became
a prominent resource for the study of medically important entomofauna
and the ecological characteristics of these insects in the regions
investigated, with meticulous attention to identification, organization, and preservation. These
samples enabled the Basic Pathology Department to develop a valuable
legacy, underscoring the significance of the collection for both its
creator and the state of Paran치. Professor Ana Leuch Lozovei
is now retired, but she is still recognized for her
commitment to thorough instruction and for fostering curiosity among her
students. The Professor Ana Leuch Lozovei Collection, which has considerable
potential for further development, serves as a reference for researchers
interested in the culicid fauna of Paran치. The collection was
established to enhance understanding of species diversity and ecological aspects
of Culicidae, as well as to identify species of potential
medical and veterinary importance in the studied areas. More specifically,
Dr. Lozovei and her collaborators aimed to map species distributions
and contribute to advances in medical entomology within the state
of Paran치.
