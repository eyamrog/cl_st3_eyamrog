The depth of the stomatal crypts was indicative of the
growth conditions. Leaves from control (field) and garden-grown plants exhibited
deeper stomatal crypts compared to those from greenhouse-grown plants, while
crypts were completely absent in plants cultivated in vitro. Stomatal
crypts were already observable in the young leaves of field-grown
plants (Figure 6d). These findings suggest that the presence of
leaf crypts in V. squamata is not strictly determined by
genetic factors.
