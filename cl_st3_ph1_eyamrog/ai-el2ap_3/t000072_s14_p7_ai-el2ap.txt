Following the recommendations of Braga et al. (2016), each sample
was collected from the soil to a depth of 10
cm in two stages. In the first stage, soil from
the 0–5 cm layer, referred to as the "upper" layer,
was removed, and in the second stage, soil from the
5–10 cm layer, referred to as the "lower" layer, was
collected. Samples from each depth were placed in separate plastic
bags. After collection, the samples were arranged in plastic trays
by first placing the lower layer and then covering it
with the upper layer. The trays were then subjected to
germination under 60% shade, with irrigation provided twice daily for
three minutes each using microsprinklers.
