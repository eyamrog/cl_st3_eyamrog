Given the increasing interest in the use of WhatsApp as
a platform for pedagogical initiatives, there is a need to
better understand the role of emojis as an emergent form
of Internet language within this context, particularly as mobile technologies
become more integrated into educational settings. This study employed an
embedded correlational mixed methods design to identify the types of
emojis used to support cognitive, teaching, and social presences in
a teacher education course conducted via WhatsApp, to examine participants’
attitudes toward emoji use, and to explore the relationship of
age and gender to this use. Data generated from teacher
interactions on WhatsApp were analyzed using Garrison et al.’s (1999)
Community of Inquiry Model, which conceptualizes effective online educational experiences
as arising from the interaction of three core elements: social,
cognitive, and teaching presences. The findings indicate that emojis can
be effectively utilized to support these three presences. Additionally, the
high frequency of emoji use appears to be influenced by
both cultural and gender-related factors.
