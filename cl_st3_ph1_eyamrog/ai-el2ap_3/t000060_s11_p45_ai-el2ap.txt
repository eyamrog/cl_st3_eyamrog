Goffman (1974, p. 9) defines "face" as an image of
the self that is constructed in accordance with socially approved
attributes, and notes that this image can be collectively recognized,
such as when an individual enhances the reputation of their
profession or religion through their own conduct. During interaction, speakers
typically seek to establish a positive self-image and affirm their
social position by adopting one of two primary attitudes: a
defensive attitude, aimed at maintaining their own face, and a
protective attitude, focused on preserving the face of their interlocutor
(Burgo & Neto, 2016, p. 885).
