The term "emoji" originates from Japanese, and although it bears
a resemblance to the English words "emotion" and "emoticon," this
similarity is generally considered coincidental, though potential linguistic connections cannot
be entirely ruled out. The first emoticon, the smiley face
":-)", was introduced in 1982 by Dr. Scott Fahlman, a
professor at Carnegie Mellon University, as a means of conveying
tone in digital communication. Today, both emoticons and emojis are
widely integrated into everyday communication. Emojis, which are updated miniature
images designed for use on mobile devices, serve to express
emotions and provide visual cues in text-based interactions. Their adoption
has rapidly expanded globally, becoming a significant aspect of digital
culture. Since the initial development of face-based emojis, the range
has broadened to include representations of animals, food, and various
other objects (Alshenqeeti, 2016).
