Bates et al. (2009) identified Calvatia lilacina as a synonym
of Calvatia fragilis in Arizona, USA. In contrast, Trierveiler-Pereira and
Baseia (2009) treated both species as distinct entities in Brazil.
Cortez et al. (2012) regarded Calvatia lilacina as a synonym
of C. cyathiformis; however, other authors, such as Verma et
al. (2018), consider C. cyathiformis to be a separate species.
