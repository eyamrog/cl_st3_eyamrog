Similar results were reported by Yasenov (2020) for the United
States and by Gallacher and Hossain (2020) for Canada. Comparable
findings have also been observed in cross-country analyses. Brussevich et
al. (2020), examining OECD countries, and Gottlieb et al. (2021),
focusing on a broad set of developing countries, both identified
a strong association between the level of economic development, or
per capita income, and the capacity for remote work.
