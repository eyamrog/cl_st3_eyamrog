When Equation 1 is estimated using a level-level functional form,
the econometric analysis identifies a greater number of statistically significant
SBD effects compared to the log-level specification. However, the adjusted
R-squared values for these level-level models are lower than those
obtained from the semi-logarithmic models, as previously demonstrated.
