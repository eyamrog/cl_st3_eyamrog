From the perspective of pedagogical authority, it has been argued
that the only legitimate and verifiable basis for teaching is
the capacity to lead by example. Valid teaching is therefore
considered ostensive, emphasizing demonstration. This concept of "ostentation," which attracted
Wittgensteinâ€™s attention, is reflected in the etymology of relevant terms:
the Latin "dicere" originally meant "to show," and only later
acquired the meaning "to show by saying." Similarly, the English
words "token" and "techen" (an intermediate form of "teach") carry
implicit connotations of "that which shows." In German, the verb
"deuten," meaning "to point," is closely related to "bedeuten," meaning
"to signify" (Steiner, 1998: 13, own translation).
