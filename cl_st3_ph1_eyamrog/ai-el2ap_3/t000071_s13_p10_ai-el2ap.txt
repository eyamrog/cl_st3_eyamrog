Cabells International conducted a comparison of PKP’s list of journals
with those included in Predatory Reports by matching the journals’
International Standard Serial Numbers (ISSNs) across both lists. Restricting the
analysis to journals with ISSNs reduced Cabells’ list to 7,490
titles (from an original 15,470) and PKP’s list to 22,802
titles (from 25,671). Among these, 237 journals were present on
both lists, corresponding to 3.2 percent of Cabells’ ISSN-matched list
and 1.0 percent of the OJS journals with ISSNs.
