The invasive species Hedychium coronarium J. KÃ¶nig (Zingiberaceae) is a
competitive terrestrial herb. To assess its ecological impact and determine
whether H. coronarium influences the composition of ground-dwelling spider assemblages,
45 traps were installed across three treatments with three replicates
each. A total of 292 spiders were collected and identified
between January and December 2018. The Intermediate Areas yielded the
highest number of individuals and the greatest species diversity, with
107 spiders (37% of the total) representing 14 species, followed
by Dominated Areas with 97 individuals (33%) from 12 species,
and Free Areas with 88 individuals (30%) from 10 species.
Statistical analysis indicated that the overall spider assemblage in Parque
Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga did not exhibit significant differences
among treatments; however, these results may not be attributable to
random variation and could be associated with the presence of
H. coronarium. Additionally, two spider families demonstrated differences in their
distribution across the treatments.
