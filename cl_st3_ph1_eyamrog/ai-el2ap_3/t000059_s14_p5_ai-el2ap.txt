For comparability, data from Scanff et al. (2021) were reweighted
to match the distribution of journal sizes observed among LILACS
journals. A sensitivity analysis limited to research articles was not
conducted in the present study, as the previous study reported
minimal differences in results when restricting to this subset. Additionally,
in the current dataset, only 244 journals contained at least
50 signed articles with an explicit publication type, and the
number of journals meeting this threshold for research articles alone
would be even lower.
