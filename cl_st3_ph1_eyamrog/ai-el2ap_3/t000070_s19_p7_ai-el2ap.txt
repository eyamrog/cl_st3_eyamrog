A double seed coat was observed, exhibiting a positive reaction
to toluidine blue O (TBO) staining. The external seed coat,
or testa, displayed a dark green coloration, which is indicative
of the presence of tannic compounds (Figure 1b). The internal
seed coat, or tegmen, exhibited a greenish coloration, suggesting a
phenolic composition, while the plumose appendages showed a purple coloration,
indicating a high pectin content (Figure 1b).
