The maximum carbon absorption rate of the plants in the
garden was approximately 45% higher than that of the plants
in the greenhouse, but about 70% lower than that of
wild plants. Despite statistically significant differences among the experimental groups,
some measurements of the maximum carbon absorption rate for garden
plants were similar to those observed in greenhouse plants. It
is challenging to locate young Vellozia squamata plants in the
field that are suitable for comparison. It remains unclear whether
the photosynthetic performance of younger plants is an inherent characteristic
of their developmental stage or a consequence of the micropropagation
protocol. Durkovic et al. (2016) reported that the method used
to obtain seedlings can affect leaf development, resulting in leaves
with distinct photosynthetic parameters.
