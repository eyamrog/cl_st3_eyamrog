Regarding the peer-review process, we contacted 14 publishers in response
to our initial inquiry to request limited password access to
their peer review systems, based on our familiarity with the
Open Journal Systems (OJS) platform. Five publishers granted access to
one of their journals each (see Table 1). Through spot-checking
an average of 12 recent articles per journal, we observed
that four of the five journals maintained complete sets of
peer reviews, while the fifth journal lacked reviews for three
out of 20 articles. On average, there were 1.6 reviews
per article; however, 24 percent of these reviews consisted solely
of a recommendation to publish without additional commentary, indicating a
need for improvement in peer review quality. Overall, among the
original sample of 50 randomly selected publishers using OJS from
Beall’s list, 14 percent were largely compliant with Beall’s basic
criteria, with five of the seven compliant publishers providing direct
evidence of peer review.
