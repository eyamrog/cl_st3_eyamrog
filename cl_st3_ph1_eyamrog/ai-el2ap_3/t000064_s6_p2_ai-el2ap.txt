The effect of light intensity on the photosynthetic performance of
Vellozia leaves has most frequently been assessed by measuring the
electron transport rate. In several Vellozia species, the electron transport
rate reaches its maximum under photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) intensities
of approximately 2,100 µmol m⁻² s⁻¹, which aligns with the
PAR values typically observed in the Cerrado during midday, ranging
from about 1,800 to 2,200 µmol m⁻² s⁻¹ (Lüttge et
al. 2007). In comparison, the maximal electron transport rate in
Smilax goyazana, a common Cerrado shrub, is achieved at approximately
half of the maximal environmental PAR (Palhares et al. 2011).
