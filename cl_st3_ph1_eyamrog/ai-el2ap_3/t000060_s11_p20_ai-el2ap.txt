Although the two-part structure, particularly the adjacency pair of "question/answer,"
is widely recognized as frequent in conversation, a three-part structure
is also observed. The Birmingham Discourse Analysis model proposes the
possibility of a three-part structure rather than limiting analysis to
two parts. Coulthard and Brazil (1992, p. 66) contend that
"all eliciting exchanges have the potential of a three-part structure,
while accepting that a two-part realization may, and in the
case of polar responses often does, occur." As demonstrated in
the general practitioner consultation below, three-part exchanges are not uncommon.
