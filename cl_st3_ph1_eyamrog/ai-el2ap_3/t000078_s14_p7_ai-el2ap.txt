Consistent with the findings of Kim, Phipps, and Anselin (2003),
Campos (2017), and Campos and Almeida (2018), the distribution of
extrinsic and intrinsic housing characteristics is not uniform within a
weighting area, contrary to the assumption made by Megbolugbe and
Hoek-Smit (1996). To address this limitation, this study incorporates the
spatial location of each house and amenity (such as schools,
shops, and libraries) rather than relying solely on the number
or presence of amenities within the weighting area. This methodology
enables the delineation of distinct neighborhoods within a weighting area
based on the size determined by the selected distance matrix
W cut-off. Additionally, this approach reduces the influence of administratively
defined neighborhood boundaries, such as districts or census tracts, thereby
minimizing the potential bias introduced by government-imposed area compositions.
