The proportion of journals using OJS on these two lists
provides limited reassurance. Given that OJS is an open-source publishing
platform that is free to download and offers documentation for
setting up and operating journals, it might be expected to
have greater adoption among journals with questionable practices. One possible
explanation for its relatively limited use is that OJS is
designed to facilitate editorial oversight and peer review, which may
deter those who do not intend to implement such processes.
Alternatively, the platform’s design and support may assist journals in
meeting standards that reduce the likelihood of being labeled as
“predatory.” Nevertheless, there is evidence that some journals use OJS
to charge authors for publication without conducting peer review, which
undermines scientific integrity. Although both lists may overcount the number
of journals, the proportion of OJS-using journals is higher in
the more recent Cabells Predatory Reports list (3.2 percent) compared
to Beall’s list (1.2 percent), and Cabells also appears to
include more journals from the Global South. This increase may
be attributable to the overall growth of OJS, highlighting the
need for platform developers to address these concerns.
