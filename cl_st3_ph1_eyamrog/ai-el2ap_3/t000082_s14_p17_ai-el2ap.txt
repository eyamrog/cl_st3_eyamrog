In the baseline coevolutionary model, the trait barrier 𝜀𝑖𝑗 represents
the threshold at which the evolutionary influence of a cheater
species on a victim species becomes negligible. To investigate the
impact of cheating interactions on network structure, we modified the
baseline model by introducing an additional trait barrier, 𝑏𝑖𝑗, which
specifies the maximum allowable absolute difference between the trait values
of two species for an interaction to occur.
