Ghosh et al. (2014) examine the primary determinants and magnitudes
of net financial flow surges, with a key contribution being
their distinction between surges driven by foreign investors and those
driven by domestic investors. Specifically, they differentiate between liability-driven surges,
associated with foreign investor activity, and asset-driven surges, associated with
domestic investor behavior. Their regression analyses indicate that external factors
have greater explanatory power than domestic factors in predicting the
probability of a surge, which accounts for the high degree
of synchrony observed in these events across emerging markets. Liability-driven
surges not only predominate in terms of occurrence probability but
are also more sensitive to changes in external conditions, contagion
effects, and the level of financial interconnectedness. Based on this
evidence, Ghosh et al. (2014) advocate for the implementation of
capital controls to mitigate excessive volatility in liability-driven surges, as
well as for the coordination of policies between emerging economies
that receive these financial flows and advanced economies that are
the source of such capital outflows.
