Lake Tanganyika, estimated to be approximately 12 million years old
(Cohen et al., 1993), is the oldest of the East
African Great Lakes. It is distinguished by its highly diverse
ichthyofauna, which contributes significantly to global freshwater lacustrine biodiversity (Coulter
et al., 1986). The lake’s surface area of 32,000 km²
is distributed among four countries: the Democratic Republic of the
Congo in the west (14,800 km² or 45%), Tanzania in
the east (13,500 km² or 41%), Burundi in the north
(2,600 km² or 8%), and Zambia in the south (2,000
km² or 6%) (Cohen et al., 1993; Fermon, 2007) (Fig.
