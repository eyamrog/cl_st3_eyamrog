This study examined the distribution of two recently proposed indicators
of endogeny among health science journals indexed in LILACS. The
proportion of articles authored by the most prolific contributor was
higher, while the Gini coefficient was lower in LILACS journals
compared to those indexed in MEDLINE. However, both differences were
no longer observed after adjusting for journal size.
