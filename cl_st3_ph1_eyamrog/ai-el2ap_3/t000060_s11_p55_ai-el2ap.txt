Although it is sometimes unavoidable to perform face-threatening acts, various
strategies can be employed to reduce their potential impact (Cruz,
2020, p. 42). For example, Rosulek (2010, p. 227) observes
that lawyers often invoke the authority of the law or
the judge to mitigate the face-threatening nature of their statements.
Specifically, lawyers may refer to judicial instructions to inform jurors
that they cannot consider the defendant’s prior bad acts as
evidence in the current case. In the statement, “As the
Court has instructed you, you should not simply conclude the
defendant’s a bad person and therefore should be convicted of
this,” Rosulek notes that the judge possesses greater authority to
issue requests or directives to the jurors. If the lawyer
were to make a direct demand or accusation, it could
potentially harm the relationship with the jurors. Therefore, by attributing
the instruction to the judge, the lawyer reduces the risk
of negative interpersonal consequences. Tkacuková (2010, p. 343) also provides
an example involving the use of politeness strategies during cross-examination,
which she analyzes in detail.
