In this phase, we aimed to assess the extent to
which journals utilizing Open Journal Systems (OJS) are classified as
“predatory” according to Beall’s and Cabells’ lists. Initially, we compared
the Public Knowledge Project (PKP) list of journals using OJS
with Beall’s final list of predatory publishers and journals, which
was discontinued in 2017 following challenges from several publishers and
organizations (Silver, 2017). To estimate the total number of journals
represented in Beall’s list as of 2018, we counted the
journals within a sample of 231 publishers, representing 19.9 percent
of the 1,163 publishers listed, regardless of OJS usage (see
Table 2). The resulting average of 24.3 journals per publisher
indicated that Beall’s list encompassed approximately 30,968 journals identified as
“predatory,” including 1,395 standalone journals. Additionally, we observed that 61.7
percent of these journals had not published any articles, and
6.3 percent lacked a website, a figure that increased to
32 percent by 2021. Among journals using OJS, 366 titles
were associated with Beall’s list, representing 1.2 percent of the
total journals on Beall’s list and 1.4 percent of the
25,671 active journals known to be using OJS (see Table
3).
