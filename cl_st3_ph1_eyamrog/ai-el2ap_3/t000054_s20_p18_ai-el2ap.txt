Mescaline has attracted attention for its potential pharmacological applications in
the treatment of headache, depression, obsessive disorders, anxiety, and substance
use disorders, including alcohol dependence. This interest is primarily due
to the substance's minimal risk of dependence and the generally
moderate and non-life-threatening nature of mescaline intoxication (Dinis-Oliveira, Lan√ßa, &
Dias, 2019).
