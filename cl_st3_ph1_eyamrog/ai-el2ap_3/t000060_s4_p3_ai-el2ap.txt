As observed in our corpus, mitigation devices served to maintain
the self-image constructed by speakers and to produce specific pragmatic
effects on listeners. The hedge "technically" and discourse markers such
as "I think," "I don’t think," and "I don’t believe"
functioned to neutralize potential contrary reactions or negative interpretations from
interlocutors; these devices reduced the impact of speakers’ utterances and
decisions by distancing the speaker from potentially divergent judgments or
opinions, thereby protecting their positive face. For example, when the
judge sustained objections raised by the deputy county attorney, she
employed politeness strategies in her interaction with the defense lawyer.
To mitigate the force of an imperative, she used the
expression “why don’t you restate” in the utterance “why don’t
you just restate the question that you technically asked her,”
which operates as a polite request and minimizes the potential
face threat.
