Analysis of the total number of collected individuals (youth and
adults) indicated that the data were normally distributed, as confirmed
by the Shapiro-Wilk normality test (W-test) (Table 2). No significant
differences were detected between treatments according to the ANOVA test
(F = 0.414, P = 0.678), and the p-values from
the Simpson Diversity t-test were greater than 0.5. These findings
were further supported by the results of the Tukey HSD
test, indicating that there were no statistically significant differences among
the treatments.
