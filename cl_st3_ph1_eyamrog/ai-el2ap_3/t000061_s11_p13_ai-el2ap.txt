Benjamin (1985) approached mimesis from a perspective more closely aligned
with that of Aristotle, identifying an active and critical dimension
inherent in human mimetic behavior (Gagnebin, 1993). According to Benjamin,
mimetic behavior involves a cognitive relationship in which the subject
actively participates by forming an internal representation of the environment;
thus, rather than merely recognizing similarities, individuals are required to
produce them (Benjamin, 1985). Unlike certain animals, such as chameleons
that can change their skin color automatically, humans must conceptualize
the object or subject to be imitated and deliberately develop
mechanisms to achieve representation. Since this process does not result
in exact replicas, individuals must compensate for discrepancies by drawing
on their own subjective experiences. Benjamin (1985) illustrates this point
with the example of handwriting: even in the act of
writing letters, which might be considered a straightforward imitation task
capable of yielding perfect copies, the outcome is invariably influenced
by the unique characteristics of the writer.
