For seed conservation, a 2x3 factorial experimental design was employed,
incorporating two conservation methods—cryopreservation (+LN; at -196 °C) and a
control group stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C (-LN)—in
combination with three collection times (120, 135, and 150 days
after anthesis [DAA]). Each experimental unit consisted of a cryotube
containing 30 seeds, with four replicates arranged in a randomized
block design. Following 24 hours of storage under the respective
conditions, seeds were immersed in a water bath at 42
°C for two minutes. Subsequently, seed disinfection was performed according
to the protocol described by Guerra and Dal Vesco (2010).
