In contrast to Plato, Aristotle (2000) re-evaluates the concept of
mimesis and its relevance to education, viewing it as a
source of positive stimuli that can be effectively utilized in
educational contexts. Aristotle’s analysis emphasizes the potential of mimetic behavior
to facilitate learning, considering this potential to be more significant
than the specific object being imitated. While both philosophers acknowledge
that mimesis is inherent to human nature, particularly in children,
Aristotle (2000) argues that mimetic behavior does not divert individuals
from the pursuit of knowledge; rather, it serves as a
mechanism that stimulates and supports the learning process, including the
role of playfulness (Gagnebin, 1993, p. 71). According to Aristotle
(as cited in Carvalho, 2019, p. 20), this perspective represents
a shift from Plato’s focus on the inherent imperfection of
representation, instead highlighting two positive aspects: the creative potential activated
in individuals through imitation, and the general enjoyment that imitation
provides.
