Most species of Asteraceae exhibit anemochory and a herbaceous growth
habit (Silva et al. 2019), as well as a range
of adaptive traits that enable their presence across diverse ecosystems
(Beretta et al. 2008). The results obtained in this study
are consistent with previous research indicating that species richness within
Asteraceae is substantial in areas of semideciduous forest (NÃ³brega et
al. 2009; Franco et al. 2012; Silva et al. 2019).
Additionally, Asteraceae is one of the largest angiosperm families in
terms of species number, characterized by anemochorous seed dispersal and
widespread distribution across nearly all terrestrial plant formations worldwide (Lorenzi
2014), which partially explains its high frequency in the study
area.
