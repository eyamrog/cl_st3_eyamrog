The emerging economies that implemented capital flow management measures (CFMs)
primarily pursued six objectives: (i) to counteract exchange rate appreciation,
(ii) to increase monetary policy autonomy, (iii) to extend the
maturity of external liabilities, (iv) to reduce the net volume
of financial inflows, (v) to mitigate credit booms, and (vi)
to address asset price inflation (Habermeier et al., 2011). The
rationale for capital controls extends beyond their direct effects on
the implementing economies, as several studies have highlighted the spillover
effects of CFMs. To assess the effectiveness of capital controls
adopted by emerging economies, Habermeier et al. (2011) employ vector
autoregression (VAR) models, finding that such measures are relatively effective
in enhancing monetary policy autonomy in Brazil, Thailand, and Colombia,
as well as in extending the maturity of external liabilities
in Colombia.
