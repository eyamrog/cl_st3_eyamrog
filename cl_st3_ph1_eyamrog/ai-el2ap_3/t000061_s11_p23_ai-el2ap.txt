In USR, learning primarily occurs through observation and imitation of
the practices demonstrated by more experienced individuals. During fieldwork, an
intern reported that she was able to successfully perform a
specific procedure only after an employee instructed her on a
particular technique for holding the scissors, indicating that without this
guidance, she would have been unable to progress. This example
illustrates that tacit knowledge constitutes a significant component of scientific
work, necessitating that individuals seeking to advance in scientific research
invest substantial time in laboratory settings to acquire such skills.
