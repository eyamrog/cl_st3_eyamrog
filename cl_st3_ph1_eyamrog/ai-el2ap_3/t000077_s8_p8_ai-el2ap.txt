The literature on Brazil has established that job losses were
more pronounced among informal workers, which has significant negative implications
for equity due to the disproportionate presence of vulnerable groups
in informal employment. Additionally, greater job losses occurred in industries
characterized by high levels of physical contact (Al Masri et
al., 2021; Corseuil et al., 2021; Bridi, 2020). In relation
to telework, GÃ³es et al. (2021) examined the composition of
the "remote workforce" by various attributes and found that it
is primarily comprised of formal-sector workers who have completed higher
education, are between 30 and 39 years old, and are
predominantly women and white individuals.
