Based on a review of the available literature, this study
presents a list of 40 gasteroid fungal species (Agaricomycetes, Basidiomycota)
recorded in Paraguay since the earliest documented collections. These species
are distributed across 16 genera and 4 families. This work
constitutes the first comprehensive compilation of data on gasteroid fungi
in Paraguay. The results indicate that the number of species
formally reported for the Paraguayan mycobiota remains limited.
