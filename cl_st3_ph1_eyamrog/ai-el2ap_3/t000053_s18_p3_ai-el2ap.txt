Two preserved sand fly specimens were included in the dataset;
these insects were collected using CDC/Shannon traps. Following collection, the
specimens were screened, separated, and accurately identified along with their
respective capture locations. The clarification of the insects was performed
according to the method described by Forattini (1973) [23]. After
clarification, the specimens were mounted between a slide and cover
slip in Enece medium (Cerqueira, 1943) [24] and identified following
the criteria established by Galati [2].
