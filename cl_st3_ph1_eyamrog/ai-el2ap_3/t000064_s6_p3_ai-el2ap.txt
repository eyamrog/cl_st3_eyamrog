Leaves from plants cultivated under in vitro conditions exhibit characteristic
effects of shading, as previously reported (Barboza et al. 2006;
Chaari-Rkhis et al. 2015; Ziv & Chen 2008), including underdeveloped
anatomical structures such as stomata. Additionally, ultrastructural characteristics commonly observed
in shaded leaves include reduced cytoplasmic content, chloroplasts that are
flattened with irregularly organized internal membrane systems, and an increased
proportion of intercellular spaces (Wetzstein & Sommer 1982; Chirin√©a et
al. 2012). In the present study, several of these features
were observed, including qualitative modifications such as the absence of
aquiferous cells, subepidermal sclerenchyma fascicles, and stomatal crypts.
