After reviewing the defendant’s statements during direct examination, Mr. Martinez
requests confirmation to ensure his understanding of the events described.
While questions and answers are common features of everyday conversation,
the conventional adjacency pair of “question/answer” often functions differently in
forensic contexts. As Gibbons (2008, p. 119) notes, in courtroom
examinations, the atypical social dynamics establish that, with certain exceptions,
lawyers and judges pose questions while witnesses are expected to
respond. In these circumstances, witnesses are generally not allowed to
provide off-topic responses or to refuse to answer, except in
cases where a response may be self-incriminating. It is also
generally assumed that cross-examining lawyers typically avoid asking questions to
which they do not already know the answer.
