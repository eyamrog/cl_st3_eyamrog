The final activity of the workshop discussed in this paper
was titled "The change I want to see is." This
activity took place following a session of questions, answers, and
participant testimonials. Participants were asked to write in the chat
the specific change they hoped to see, serving as their
concluding statement for the workshop. The purpose of this activity
was to encourage participants to synthesize and apply insights gained
during the workshop in a creative manner. They were prompted
to articulate either a personal goal or a broader societal
change they wished to achieve. Participants were given several minutes
to reflect before simultaneously submitting their responses in the chat.
All entries were visible to the group and were subsequently
read aloud by one of the facilitators. Excerpt 4 presents
a selection of these responses.
