Epipedobates anthonyi is a frog species endemic to Peru, Colombia,
and Ecuador, notable for the potent toxin present on its
skin, which has attracted scientific interest since the 1970s. During
this period, chemist John Daly from the US National Institutes
of Health collected skin samples of this amphibian in Ecuador.
It is possible that these samples were exported via diplomatic
channels, as there is no evidence that the Ecuadorian Institute
of Forestry and Natural Areas (INEFAN, later incorporated into the
Ministry of Environment) issued a permit for their collection (GRAIN
1998). Subsequent laboratory research led to the synthesis of epibatidine,
a non-opioid alkaloid with significant pharmaceutical potential.
