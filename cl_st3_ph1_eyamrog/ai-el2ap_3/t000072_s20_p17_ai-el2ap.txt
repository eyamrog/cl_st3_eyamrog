The mean values of the Pielou index ranged from 0.78
in region R to 0.87 in region I. This indicates
that species are more evenly distributed in region I, with
no evidence of ecological dominance. However, both regions exhibited high
Pielou index values, suggesting a generally even distribution of species
across the study areas. According to Pin√£-Rodrigues and Aoki (2014),
lower Pielou index values indicate that most individuals are concentrated
in a few species. For comparison, Bargoena et al. (2020)
reported a Pielou index of 0.79 at the edge of
a semideciduous forest, which is consistent with the values observed
in the present study.
