In the field of learner language research, only a limited
number of accessible corpora are available, including the International Corpus
of Learner English (ICLE), the Louvain International Database of Spoken
English Interlanguage (LINDSEI), the Louvain Corpus of Native English Essays
(LOCNESS), the Michigan Corpus of Upper-Level Student Papers (MICUSP), and
the British Academic Written English corpus (BAWE). Each corpus was
developed with a specific focus: ICLE and LINDSEI provide data
on English learners’ interlanguage, MICUSP and BAWE contain high-quality written
papers from various genres, and LOCNESS comprises essays by American
and British university students. Despite differences in their primary objectives,
these corpora share several situational characteristics, notably that all participants
are students in higher education, producing spoken or written texts
either under assessment conditions or otherwise, and sometimes with or
without time constraints. Although the production contexts may differ, the
contributors are consistently novice or apprentice writers. The principal distinction
among these corpora lies in the participants’ first language backgrounds.
Given these characteristics, researchers must consider the suitability of these
corpora for their specific research questions. In our case, since
our research is situated within a Brazilian university, certain questions
remain unaddressed if our studies are restricted to these existing
corpora. Although these corpora are substantial in size and ICLE
includes a subcorpus of essays by Brazilian students (Br-ICLE), they
do not adequately meet our requirements, particularly for in-depth analysis
of linguistic variation across text genres, academic levels (undergraduate and
graduate), disciplines, and proficiency levels, or for examining user choices
from cross-sectional or longitudinal perspectives. These aspects are not comprehensively
represented in Br-ICLE. Additionally, facilitating access to a new corpus
for other researchers is one of our objectives. To this
end, a CQPweb interface will soon be available for our
corpus, offering functionalities such as keyword searches, collocate lists with
various association measures, and visualization of occurrence dispersion.
