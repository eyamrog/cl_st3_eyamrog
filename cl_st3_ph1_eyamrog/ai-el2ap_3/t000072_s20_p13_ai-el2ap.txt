Of the 29 species identified in this study, eleven have
been previously reported in both semideciduous and riparian forests, seven
have been reported exclusively in semideciduous forest, two exclusively in
riparian forest, and nine have not been reported in either
phytophysiognomy according to Flora do Brasil 2020 (2021). Given that
the study area consists of riparian forest contiguous with a
fragment of semideciduous forest, these findings suggest that the presence
of the forest fragment may significantly influence the species diversity
observed in the riparian forest. It is important to note
that information regarding phytophysiognomic occurrence is not consistently recorded on
herbarium specimen labels, and much of the data on angiosperm
species occurrence in Flora do Brasil 2020 (2021) may have
been derived from such sources. This may explain the relatively
high number of species found in this study that have
not been previously reported for semideciduous or riparian forests.
