Regarding spillover effects, certain impulse-response functions indicated that these effects
were more pronounced in the post-crisis period. In addition to
increasing net financial flows and exerting greater pressure on exchange
rate appreciation compared to the pre-crisis period, these effects also
diminished monetary policy autonomy in other emerging markets. The regression
results suggest that spillover effects were more significant for Latin
American economies than for those in Asia, primarily because Latin
American countries exhibit a higher degree of financial openness and
a greater reliance on bank flows as a source of
external funding.
