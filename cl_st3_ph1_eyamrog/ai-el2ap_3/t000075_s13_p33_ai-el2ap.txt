The implementation of prudential capital controls can lead domestic agents
to internalize the consequences of their borrowing decisions, thereby mitigating
the risk of financial amplification. Furthermore, such controls may facilitate
the intertemporal smoothing of consumption and contribute to higher economic
growth, challenging prevailing orthodox views (Korinek, 2011). Similarly, Ostry et
al. (2012) contend that capital inflow controls targeting these externalities
are designed to reduce the relevant component of the representative
agentâ€™s consumption function, thereby promoting intertemporal consumption smoothing.
