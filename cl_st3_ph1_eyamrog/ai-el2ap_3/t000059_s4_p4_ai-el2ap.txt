This pattern is likely applicable not only to health sciences
journals from Latin America and the Caribbean but also to
those from other regions. If journals indexed in MEDLINE exhibit
authorship concentration indexes comparable to those of journals indexed in
LILACS, after adjusting for journal size, it is reasonable to
expect that similar distributions of these indexes would be observed
in other reputable bibliographic databases within the health sciences. The
relative prevalence of non-English-language journals among the outliers identified by
Scanff and colleagues (2021) may also be attributable to the
tendency of larger journals to publish in English; however, verifying
this hypothesis falls outside the scope of the present study.
Whether the distribution of authorship concentration indexes is consistent across
disciplines beyond the health sciences remains an open question.
