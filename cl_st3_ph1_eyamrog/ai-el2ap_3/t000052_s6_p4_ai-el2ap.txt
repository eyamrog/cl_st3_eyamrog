With the exception of Auchenoglanis occidentalis individuals sampled by Euzet
and Le Brun in Bamako (Niger River), which were found
to host three species of Bagrobdella (B. auchenoglanii, B. fraudulenta,
and B. anthopenis), surveys conducted in other localities—including Lake Albert,
Uganda (Paperna 1971); Kara River, Togo (Kritsky & Kulo 1999);
Oti River (Euzet & Le Brun 1990); Volta Lake, Volta
Basin (Paperna 1969); Sassandra, Côte d'Ivoire (Euzet & Le Brun
1990); and on Parauchenoglanis monkei in Cameroon (Akoumba et al.
2017)—indicate the presence of only a single Bagrobdella species at
each site (B. fraudulenta in Uganda, B. parauchenoglanii in Cameroon,
and B. auchenoglanii in the remaining localities).
