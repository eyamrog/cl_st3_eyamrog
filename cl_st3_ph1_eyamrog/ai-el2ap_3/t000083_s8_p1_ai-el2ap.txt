Engagement in various online activities, including accessing websites, using messenger
applications, participating in social media, and Internet gaming, has become
a routine aspect of daily life for most individuals, particularly
adolescents and young adults (Lin et al., 2017; McLean et
al., 2019). The proliferation of social media platforms such as
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat has led to an
increase in research focused on problematic social media use, behavioral
dependence, and the associated impacts on individuals' lives (Alimoradi et
al., 2019; Montag et al., 2015, 2017). Nevertheless, the literature
has seldom addressed the relationship between social media use and
aspects of well-being and self-esteem, including specific behaviors such as
taking and sharing selfies, particularly among adolescent populations.
