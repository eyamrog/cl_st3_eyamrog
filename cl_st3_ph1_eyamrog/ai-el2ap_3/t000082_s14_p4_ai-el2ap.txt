We assume that if the trait difference between species i
and j is greater than or equal to 𝜀𝑖𝑗, such
that |Zj(t) − Zi(t)| ≥ 𝜀𝑖𝑗, then δij = 0,
indicating that the cheater species exerts no selective pressure on
the victim species. In this context, 𝜀𝑖𝑗 represents a trait
barrier that prevents interaction due to trait dissimilarity (e.g., Santamaria
& Rodríguez-Gironés 2007). Conversely, if |Zj(t) − Zi(t)| < 𝜀𝑖𝑗,
then δij = 1, and selection on victim i will
favor either an increase or decrease in trait values depending
on the sign of Zj(t) − Zi(t). If Zj(t) −
Zi(t) is positive, the sign of 𝜀𝑖𝑗 will also be
positive, whereas if Zj(t) − Zi(t) is negative, the sign
of 𝜀𝑖𝑗 will be negative (Andreazzi et al. 2017). Finally,
we assume that the environmental component Sei represents the combined
effects of all other selective pressures that favor an optimal
trait value for each species, denoted as θi.
