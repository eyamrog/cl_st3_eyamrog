Among the families with the highest number of individuals sampled,
Urticaceae was the most represented, accounting for 220 individuals (44.53%)
distributed across three species: Cecropia glaziovii Snethl. (127 individuals), Cecropia
pachystachia Tr√©cul. (91 individuals), and Urera baccifera (L.) Gaudich. ex
Wedd. (two individuals). Cannabaceae was the second most abundant family,
with 97 individuals (19.64%), comprising Celtis sp. (50 individuals) and
Trema micrantha (L.) Blume. (47 individuals). Solanaceae ranked third, with
66 individuals (13.36%), including Solanum americanum Mill. (47 individuals), Solanum
lycocarpum A. St-Hil. (nine individuals), Solanum mauritianum Scop. (seven individuals),
Capsicum baccatum var. praetermissum (Heiser & P. G. Smith) Hunz.
(two individuals), and Nicandra physalodes (L.) Gaertn. (one individual). These
results indicate that the majority of sampled individuals belong to
pioneer species, which suggests that, in the context of soil
transposition for ecological restoration, these species could facilitate the initial
recovery of the area by providing soil cover and supporting
the subsequent establishment of non-pioneer species.
