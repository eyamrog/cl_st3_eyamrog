Our findings have direct implications for the reputation of PKP’s
software and its users, as well as for the underlying
purpose of this open source project, which is to facilitate
open access to research and contribute to the improvement of
scholarly communication. The data from the OJS journals analyzed in
this study have been made publicly available to support reproducibility
and enable further research, thereby mitigating potential bias (Khanna et
al., 2021). Additionally, a potential conflict of interest arises from
the general principle that open source software projects, such as
OJS, are committed to respecting users’ freedom to use the
software for any purpose, as articulated in standard open source
definitions (Wheeler, n.d.). However, rather than adhering strictly to a
non-interventionist approach, we recognize a responsibility to evaluate and influence
the role of OJS in the context of so-called “predatory”
publishing practices. The objective of this research is to clarify
the potential contributions that open source software and open infrastructure
platform developers can make in addressing these challenges.
