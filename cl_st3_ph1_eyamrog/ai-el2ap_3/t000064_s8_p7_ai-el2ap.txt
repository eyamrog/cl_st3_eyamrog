Numerous studies have examined the anatomy of Velloziaceae species (Ayensu
1968, 1969, 1974; Menezes 1977, 1988; Coetzee 1974; Ayensu &
Skvarla 1974; Menezes & Semir 1991; Amaral & Mello-Silva 2008;
Mello-Silva 2010), including investigations specifically focused on V. squamata (Ayensu
1974; Menezes 1977). However, none of these studies have addressed
the leaf anatomy of micropropagated plants or the anatomical responses
of these species to shading. Furthermore, there are no published
anatomical analyses of Vellozia species cultivated in vitro. The present
study therefore aims to assess the effects of in vitro
micropropagation conditions on the photosynthetic responses and leaf anatomical structure
of V. squamata.
