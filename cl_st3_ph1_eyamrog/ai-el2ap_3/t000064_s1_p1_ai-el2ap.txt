This study evaluates the photosynthetic parameters and leaf anatomy of
Vellozia squamata Pohl (Velloziaceae) at different stages of in vitro
cultivation, using wild plants as a control group. Anatomical analyses
were conducted on the middle portion of the leaf, and
photosynthetic curves were generated using an infrared gas analyzer. In
vitro plantlets exhibited the thinnest and least developed leaves, while
wild plants had the thickest and most developed leaves; plants
undergoing acclimatization displayed intermediate characteristics. The physiological responses followed a
similar trend, with in vitro plantlets unable to achieve net
carbon assimilation. Young seedlings grown in the garden demonstrated a
maximal net carbon assimilation rate lower than that of wild
plants. These findings indicate that light intensity during the in
vitro phase should be optimized to improve seedling development.
