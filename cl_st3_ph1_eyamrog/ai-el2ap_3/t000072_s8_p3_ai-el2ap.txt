The composition of the seed bank may vary because it
consists of seeds produced by individuals within the fragment as
well as seeds dispersed from external sources (Bossuyt & Honnay,
2008). The seed bank represents a reservoir of viable, non-germinated
seeds located in the soil, which may either germinate within
a short period or persist in a dormant state until
environmental conditions become favorable for germination (Martins, 2009).
