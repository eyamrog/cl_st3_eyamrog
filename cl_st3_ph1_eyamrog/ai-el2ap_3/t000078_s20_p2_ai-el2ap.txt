Given the ad hoc nature of neighborhood composition, various weighting
matrices are employed in this analysis. Specifically, binary contiguity matrices
(queen and rook), distance-based matrices, and k-nearest neighbor matrices are
utilized. In the contiguity matrices, the element \( w_{ij} \)
is assigned a value of 1 if units \( i
\) and \( j \) are contiguous, and 0 otherwise.
The distance-based weight matrix is constructed using the Euclidean distances
between the centroids of the tracts, such that \( w_{ij}
\leq d_{ij} \). To address the potential issue of isolated
units in the econometric estimation, a maximum distance threshold of
8 km is imposed to ensure that each unit has
at least one neighbor. For the k-nearest neighbor matrix, six
neighbors are selected for each unit, corresponding to the average
number of neighbors observed in the dataset.
