According to the Council of Science Editors (2018), the World
Association of Medical Editors (2009), and the International Committee of
Medical Journal Editors (2021), editorial decisions should be based exclusively
on the validity of the work and its relevance to
readers, rather than on any competing interests of the editors
or the commercial interests of the journal owners. This issue
can be particularly pronounced in journals owned by universities or
other research institutions, as editors may share the same competing
interests as the journal owners. The scope of such journals
often closely aligns with the research activities of the parent
organization, and it is common for editors, reviewers, and authors
to be affiliated with the same institution. As discussed by
Barradas and Pinheiro (2016), this endogeneity has the potential to
introduce bias into the peer review process, resulting in greater
leniency and reduced diversity of perspectives, which may ultimately compromise
the journal’s contribution to the scientific record; see also Sarigöl
et al. (2017).
