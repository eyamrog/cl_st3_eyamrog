In the second activity, titled "What’s True About Me," facilitators
aimed to provide all participants, not only the guests, with
an opportunity to share personal information. All participants were instructed
to cover their cameras and listen to a general statement
pertaining to one individual, such as "What’s true about me
is that I like to wake up late." Participants for
whom the statement was accurate were then instructed to uncover
their cameras, allowing others to identify shared characteristics. After several
rounds, participants reported increased confidence in engaging with one another
based on both their differences and similarities.
