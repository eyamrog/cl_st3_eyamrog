Most scientific journals in the region are owned by universities
(Fischman et al. 2010; Beigel et al. 2021), which may
result in journals indexed in LILACS exhibiting higher levels of
endogeneity compared to those in MEDLINE. However, the region has
an established practice of considering endogeneity in journal evaluations (Amorim
et al. 2015; Rozemblum et al. 2015; Paz Enrique et
al. 2016; Boas et al. 2021), and the absence of
significant endogeneity is one of the criteria for journal selection
in LILACS (Suga 2019). Therefore, the overall endogeneity of LILACS-indexed
journals is likely influenced by the interplay between these factors.
The objective of this study was to describe authorship concentration
indexes among health sciences journals indexed in LILACS and to
compare these indexes with those reported by Scanff et al.
(2021) for MEDLINE.
