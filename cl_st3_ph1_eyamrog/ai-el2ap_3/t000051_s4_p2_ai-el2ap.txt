By integrating these discourses, as demonstrated, Scholz contends that a
paradigm shift in military spending is necessary for Germany to
attain a level of military capability commensurate with its significance
in Europe. In his proposals, this shift would result in
a defense budget positioning Germany as the third-largest global defense
spender, following the United States and China. The discourse framing
Germany as a military power is also characterized by centripetal
tendencies through processes of naturalization (Baxter, 2011, p. 171; Deetz,
1992): it is asserted that there was “no other response”
to arms delivery, that it is “clear” increased defense spending
is required, and that NATO “must” remain strong to safeguard
German freedom and democracy in the future, thereby legitimizing these
measures by invoking concerns about potential future threats (Reyes, 2011).
Given Germany’s influential role within the European Union, Scholz presents
this perceived threat as not only relevant to Germany but
also expects the rest of Europe to adopt a similar
paradigm shift.
