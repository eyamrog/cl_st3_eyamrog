In our simulations, coevolutionary dynamics with p = 0 (i.e.,
no cheating interactions) resulted in negligible changes in network structure,
as indicated by ΔQ ≅ 0 and ΔNODF ≅ 0.
As the frequency of cheating interactions increased, mutualistic networks exhibited
higher modularity and lower nestedness (Table 4). These changes in
network structure were not replicated by the random removal of
interactions. Furthermore, the magnitude of increased modularity and decreased nestedness
varied among different types of mutualisms. Mutualisms in which the
empirical network was initially highly modular and not nested (such
as ant-myrmecophyte networks) exhibited weaker structural changes compared to mutualisms
with higher initial nestedness (such as pollination and seed dispersal
networks). Overall, the presence of cheaters in empirical networks tends
to shift network structure toward higher modularity and lower nestedness
(Table 4).
