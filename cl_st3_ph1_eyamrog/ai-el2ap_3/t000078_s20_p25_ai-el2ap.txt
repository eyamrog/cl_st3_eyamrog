From Table 5 (columns 13-20), the signs and statistical significance
of the estimated coefficients remain consistent, and the direction of
the effects continues to contradict theoretical expectations across both spatial
weight matrices and functional forms. These findings support the internal
validity of the estimates and reinforce the hypothesis that the
model exhibits bias when SBD controls are omitted. Furthermore, for
the log-level functional form and the quadratic specification of the
CBD variable, the estimated coefficient demonstrates robustness to changes in
the spatial weight matrices. This outcome provides further evidence against
the use of the quadratic form of CBD as a
control variable in the model.
