The mean Shannon index in plots R was lower (1.90)
than in plots I (2.20); however, this difference was not
statistically significant according to the t-test (p > 0.05). The
Shannon-Weaver index values for both regions did not exceed 3,
which, based on the criteria established by Souza et al.
(2013), indicates low diversity. The consistent forest structure in mature
forest areas is associated with reduced seed rain, which in
turn leads to lower diversity and density in the seed
bank, resulting in the formation of a seedling bank by
the species present in the community (Souza et al. 2006).
