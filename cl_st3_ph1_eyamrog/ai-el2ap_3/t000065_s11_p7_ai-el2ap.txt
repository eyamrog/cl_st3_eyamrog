Researchers compiling their own corpora must adhere to rigorous design
criteria. As Gilquin (2015, p. 16) notes, such criteria are
particularly important in the creation of learner corpora due to
the considerable heterogeneity of interlanguage; these design considerations will be
discussed in detail in the following section. Additionally, there is
a lack of research focusing on texts produced by students
within their actual classroom writing contexts (Staples & Reppen, 2016),
a gap that the CorIFA corpus aims to address by
compiling data from class activities in English for Academic Purposes
courses. Through the systematic collection of learner metadata and careful
attention to task and language variables, as outlined in the
next section, CorIFA facilitates comprehensive investigations of learner writing in
classroom contexts.
