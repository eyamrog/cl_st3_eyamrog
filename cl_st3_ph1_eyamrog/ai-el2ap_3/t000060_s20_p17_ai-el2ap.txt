Compared to yes/no questions, tag questions and declarative questions exhibit
a stronger bias toward confirmative answers and are therefore considered
more coercive (Huddleston & Pullum, 2002, pp. 881–894). In addition
to eliciting type-conforming responses from witnesses, these question types provide
a further advantage to legal counsel: they are often perceived
as statements, which facilitates the transformation of questions into evidence
(Hobbs, 2003b, pp. 486–487). As a result, tag questions and
declarative questions serve as effective tools that allow counsel to
present evidence on behalf of witnesses and limit witnesses to
the role of minimal responders. Among these, tag questions are
regarded by some scholars as the most coercive, due to
their additional pragmatic function of implying that the respondent recognizes
the questioner’s correctness (Woodbury, 1984, p. 205; Berk-Seligson, 1999, p.
36). However, Gibbons (2003, p. 101) cautions against focusing solely
on question form, emphasizing that intonation and tone of voice
are also critical in determining the degree of coerciveness.
