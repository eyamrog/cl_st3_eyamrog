Cheating interactions can promote trait disparity in mutualistic networks by
generating clusters of species traits at certain frequencies. At intermediate
frequencies of cheating interactions, the combined effects of mutualistic selection,
which favors trait matching, and cheater interactions, which favor trait
mismatching, result in the formation of trait clusters. Theoretical evidence
suggests that the proportion of positive to negative effects between
species in real communities is approximately 1:1 (Dodds 1997). Therefore,
the observed increase in trait disparity due to the formation
of trait clusters at intermediate levels of cheating interactions may
be empirically testable. The prevalence of cheaters may be underestimated
in empirical networks (Genini et al. 2010), in part due
to substantial behavioral plasticity among interacting individuals (Bronstein 2001). Intraspecific
variation that generates behavioral plasticity may significantly influence individual fitness
and occasionally result in cheating behavior. These findings suggest that
trait disparity in mutualistic interactions may be higher than previously
assumed, and future research would benefit from measuring trait disparity
in empirical communities.
