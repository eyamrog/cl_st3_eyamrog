Plants of the genus Vellozia (Velloziaceae) are distributed in African
and South American savannahs and are more commonly found in
open vegetation types, such as rupestrian fields and Cerrado stricto
sensu (Ayensu 1969; Coetzee 1974; Mello-Silva & Menezes 1999; Batista
2016). These species exhibit high resistance to fire and drought
(Owoseye & Sanford 1972) and possess stems capable of absorbing
water (Oliveira et al. 2005). Vellozia species frequently produce resins
and various secondary metabolites with medicinal potential (Quintao et al.
2013), including compounds that inhibit snake venom activity (Tribuiani et
al. 2014). Some species are cultivated as ornamentals, which is
likely due to their large, conspicuous flowers and distinctive architecture
(Souza 2005). However, populations of Vellozia are threatened by extractive
activities and the expansion of agricultural land.
