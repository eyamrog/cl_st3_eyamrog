Heritage and Watson (1977, pp. 2-3) identify three processes involved
in the reformulation of news materials: (1) the preservation of
certain selected aspects of the original sense and reference within
the content of the reformulated utterance; (2) the transformation of
the syntactic and semantic framework in which the news was
initially presented; and (3) the deletion of one or more
aspects of the original news content.
