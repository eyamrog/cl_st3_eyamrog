In the third activity, facilitators encouraged participants to pose additional
questions to any individual they were interested in or to
comment on any topic discussed during the workshop. Participants were
also given the opportunity to elaborate on their responses, specifically
regarding their efforts to collaborate with others in their professional
environments during the pandemic. Excerpt 1 presents a guest testimonial
that exemplifies the type of discourse that occurred during the
session.
