An increased proportion of cheating interactions is associated with greater
trait disparity among both animal and plant species within the
network (Fig. 2a-c). This effect is consistent across the three
types of networks analyzed, resulting in elevated trait disparity regardless
of network type (Table 2). Therefore, cheating interactions contribute to
increased trait disparity across species, and this effect appears to
be independent of the ecological network structure (Fig. 2). Based
on these findings, an analytical approximation was developed to relate
the significance of evolutionary effects to species trait disparity. Both
simulation results and the analytical approximation indicate that cheating interactions
lead to an increase in trait disparity (Supporting Information).
