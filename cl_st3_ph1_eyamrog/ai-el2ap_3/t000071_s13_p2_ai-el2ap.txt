This study was conducted in three phases between 2018 and
2021. In the first phase, a small sample of publishers
and journals utilizing Open Journal Systems (OJS) and listed in
Beall’s list and Cabells Predatory Reports were contacted to assess
their willingness to consider recommendations for improving journal quality. The
second phase aimed to determine the prevalence of OJS-using journals
within Beall’s list and Cabells Predatory Reports. The third phase
provided a technical response to the findings of the previous
phases by proposing mechanisms for the scholarly publishing industry to
verify and publicly communicate a journal’s compliance with established scholarly
standards. This approach addresses the persistent lack of transparency that
facilitates predatory practices and contributes to the ambiguity and potential
misuse of the term “predatory.”
