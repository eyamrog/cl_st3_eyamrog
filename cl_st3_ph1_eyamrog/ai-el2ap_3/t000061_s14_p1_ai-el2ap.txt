This article forms part of a research project initiated in
2016 by the Research Group (name withheld for anonymity). The
study is primarily based on data collected through online questionnaires
administered to researchers in the social sciences and humanities (SSH)
at various career stages, including senior researchers (defined as leaders
and vice-leaders of research groups), doctoral students, and researchers in
training (students with undergraduate scientific research experience), as well as
participants with international experience. The objective is to generate knowledge
regarding the effects of normative interference, specifically the imposition of
external standards (heteronym imposition), on the development and exercise of
moral autonomy among researchers.
