The Pinheiros region is the only area in which statistical
significance is lost when the weight matrices are altered; however,
the direction of the effect remains consistent with expectations. In
this model, the Morumbi district (A9), which is adjacent to
Pinheiros, exhibits a statistically significant effect with the anticipated direction.
It is not possible to determine whether the subcenter is
located precisely on the census tract boundary between these two
regions, and this minor discrepancy observed in a single model
is not considered substantial. Therefore, Pinheiros continues to be characterized
as a business subcentrality.
