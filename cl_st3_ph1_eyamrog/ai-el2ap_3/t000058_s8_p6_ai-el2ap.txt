Biodiversity constitutes a significant global resource and should be recognized
as essential for the development of individual nations. In this
context, national scientific collections serve as critical repositories of a
country's biological diversity, functioning as temporal records of the organisms
present within specific environments [5â€“7]. These biological collections are highly
valuable to the scientific community, as the data they contain
facilitate strategic research initiatives and contribute to the fulfillment of
international agreements and treaties [5,8,9]. Access to these collections is
fundamental for researchers requiring authoritative taxonomic references and associated information
for taxa of interest [10,11].
