Statistical analysis was conducted using the software PAST 3.0 (Hammer
& Harper 2006). The total number of species, species diversity
as measured by the Shannon-Weaver index (H'), and species evenness
as indicated by Pielou's evenness index (J) (Krebs 2007) were
calculated. A t-test was performed to determine whether the H'
values differed significantly between groups, with statistical significance set at
p < 0.05.
