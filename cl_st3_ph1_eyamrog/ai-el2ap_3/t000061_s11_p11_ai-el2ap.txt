During the school phase, as in early human history, mimetic
behavior is primarily influenced by physical stimuli and physiological responses
aimed at self-preservation, with fear playing a significant role. In
this context, individuals tend to imitate the behavior of those
perceived as the most capable or adapt to their environment.
Adorno (1993) identifies a connection between archaic mimicry and the
persistence of such behavior in childhood, characterizing it as a
pre-conceptual stage in the process of engaging with and understanding
the world. According to Gebauer and Wulf (2004), Adorno regards
mimesis as a central concept in the educational process (Bildung),
arguing that it is fundamental to intersubjective social practices and
essential for the development and maintenance of moral action through
imitation.
