In using the expression "I don’t believe it’s non-responsive," Ms.
Willmott seeks to justify why Arias needed to provide background
information in response to the question. Expressions such as "I
think," "I believe," and "I assume" are classified as opinion
markers and are frequently employed with the first person singular.
While the epistemic value of these verbs typically conveys certainty
and conviction, they can also indicate uncertainty or inaccuracy. In
this context, the opinion marker functions as a facework strategy,
serving to limit or neutralize potential negative reactions or misinterpretations
from interlocutors. This usage demonstrates an intention to guide the
audience, particularly the judge, in interpreting the speaker’s statement. As
a modalization marker, it mitigates the illocutionary force of the
utterance. The use of "I don’t believe" allows the speaker
to protect their positive face by framing their opinion in
a way that acknowledges the possibility of differing viewpoints.
