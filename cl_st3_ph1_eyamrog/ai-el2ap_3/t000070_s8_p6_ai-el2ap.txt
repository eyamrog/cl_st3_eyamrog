In Bromeliaceae, seeds of certain species have demonstrated high tolerance
to drying and freezing, as observed in the genera Encholirium
Mart. ex Schult. & Schult. f. and Dyckia Schult. &
Schult. f. (Tarr√© et al. 2007), in Pitcairnia albiflos Herbert
(Pereira et al. 2010), and in ten endemic and threatened
Brazilian species (Rodrigues et al. 2014). This tolerance is associated
with the content and deposition of storage compounds such as
carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, which are integral components of cells
and membranes and contribute to protection during seed maturation and
dehydration (Mollo et al. 2011; Carvalho et al. 2019).
