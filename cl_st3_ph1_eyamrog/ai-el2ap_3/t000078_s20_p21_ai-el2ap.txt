One approach to understanding the low productivity is to examine
the educational attainment of workers in each SBD. Table 9
provides data on the educational composition of workers in each
SBD, which can be used to assess potential correlations with
wage patterns, although the analysis remains limited in rigor. In
Pinheiros, 42% of employees have completed at least high school
(including those with incomplete higher education), and 34% possess at
least a completed college degree. In Itaim Bibi, which has
the highest wage composition among all identified SBDs, 40% of
workers have completed at least high school, and 40.4% hold
at least a bachelorâ€™s degree.
