First released in 2002, Open Journal Systems (OJS) was used
by 25,671 active journals in 2020, spanning 155 countries, with
81.7 percent of these journals based in the Global South,
particularly in Indonesia, Brazil, and the United States, and publishing
research in 56 languages, most commonly English, Indonesian, and Portuguese
(Fig. 1). These journals published an average of 38.8 articles
each in 2020, contributing to a total of over 4.7
million articles since 2010. The Public Knowledge Project (PKP) collects
these and other data from journals through the software’s optional
beacon feature; however, as some users disable this feature, the
reported figures likely underestimate the actual totals. Previous studies indicate
that the majority of journals using OJS are open access
(89 percent) and constitute 60 percent of so-called “diamond open
access” journals, which do not charge subscription fees to readers
or article processing charges to authors (Alperin et al., 2017;
Becerril et al., 2021; Edgar & Willinsky, 2010). While most
OJS journals are indexed by Google Scholar and, to a
lesser extent, by the Directory of Open Access Journals, the
OJS user base is diverse, including established journals, new and
inexperienced publishers, and some journals with questionable practices.
