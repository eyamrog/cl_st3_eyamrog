Adorno’s theoretical rejection of this archaic form of mimesis is
based on its tendency to negate the subject’s individuality by
promoting unreflective assimilation into the surrounding context and by relying
on non-rational mechanisms to alleviate fear. According to Plato (1997),
the use of mimicry in education jeopardizes the development of
a rational understanding of the world by encouraging an uncritical
enjoyment of nature and the arts. Similarly, Adorno and Horkheimer
(1985), building on Platonic criticism but within a modern framework,
argue that this early form of mimesis poses a potential
threat to the rational clarification of nature.
