Second, the centrality of a cheater species does not alter
the pattern of trait disparity resulting from mutualisms that include
cheating interactions. While species centrality is recognized as a key
metric for identifying influential species within ecological networks (Martín González
et al. 2010), it is not the sole factor shaping
network structure and dynamics. For example, the distribution of mutualistic
and antagonistic interactions among species within a network influences the
network's ability to maintain its structure under perturbations (Montesinos-Navarro et
al. 2017). Future research should investigate how the specific positions
of cheating interactions within networks may affect coevolutionary dynamics.
