As a starting point for estimating the Hedonic Price Model,
the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation used in Equation 1
imposes the following restrictions on the spatial parameters: 𝜌 =
𝜆 = 𝜅₀ = 𝜏ₚ = 0. This approach enables
an assessment of whether the inclusion of control variables addresses
the potential spatial dependence identified in the literature and allows
for the evaluation of whether the price gradient declines with
increasing distance from the central business district (CBD).
