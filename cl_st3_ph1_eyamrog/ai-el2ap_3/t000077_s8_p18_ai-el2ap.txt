Crowley and Doran (2020) conducted a comparable analysis for Ireland,
identifying substantial variation in the potential for social distancing and
remote work both across different occupations and within individual industries.
Their findings indicate that the likelihood of engaging in remote
work is higher for workers residing in more affluent, larger,
and more densely populated cities, as well as for those
with higher levels of education and access to superior broadband
infrastructure.
