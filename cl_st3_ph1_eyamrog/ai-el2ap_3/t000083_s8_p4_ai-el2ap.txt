Research on selfie behavior remains limited, with most existing studies,
primarily conducted by Asian researchers, focusing on the potential negative
impacts of selfie behavior on psychological and physical health (Dokur
et al., 2018; Pantic et al., 2017). Findings from these
studies suggest possible associations between selfie behavior and factors such
as narcissism, self-centeredness, low self-esteem, loneliness, and depression. However, these
studies did not employ psychometric instruments to directly assess these
psychological constructs, and therefore, their conclusions should be interpreted as
tentative inferences rather than definitive evidence.
