Questions and answers frequently occur in conversation and are produced
at distinct points within the sequential organization of talk. Regardless
of their specific content, questioners are oriented toward subsequent discourse,
relying on forthcoming responses, whereas answerers are oriented toward prior
discourse, responding to what has just been said. Although a
question is constructed to elicit an answer and appears to
depend on receiving one, an answer is even more contingent
on the preceding question, as it is less meaningful in
isolation than the utterance that prompted it. Thus, answers necessarily
operate in relation to an interactional sequence that has already
been initiated.
