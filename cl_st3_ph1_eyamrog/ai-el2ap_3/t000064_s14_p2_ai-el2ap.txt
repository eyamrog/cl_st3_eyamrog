Leaf anatomy was analyzed using transverse sections taken from the
middle third of three fully developed leaves from each group.
Fresh sections were fixed in FAA70 under vacuum, dehydrated through
an ethanol series, embedded in LeicaÂ® resin, and stained with
either toluidine blue or a combination of safranine and Astra
blue, following the protocols described by Johansen (1940) and Kraus
& Arduin (1997). The slides were mounted with colorless glass
varnish as described by Paiva et al. (2006).
