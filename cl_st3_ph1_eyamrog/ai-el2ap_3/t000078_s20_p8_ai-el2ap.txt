The CBD coefficient is not statistically significant in any of
the functional forms analyzed (Table 4, columns 1-2). When the
model is adjusted to account for the quadratic effect of
distance from the CBD, the direction of the coefficients diverges
from theoretical expectations and remains statistically insignificant (Table 4, columns
3-4). These findings may be explained by two factors: (a)
spatial dependence, which could be affecting the coefficient estimates and
statistical tests, and/or (b) the omission of relevant variables, such
as the presence of a secondary business district (SBD), which
would indicate a polycentric urban structure in the case of
SÃ£o Paulo.
