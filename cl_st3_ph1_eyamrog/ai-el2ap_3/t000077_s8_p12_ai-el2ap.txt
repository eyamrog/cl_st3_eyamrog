Due to the unprecedented nature of the health and economic
crisis caused by Covid-19, a rapidly expanding body of literature
has emerged to assess its various impacts. In relation to
the labor market, a particularly active area of research focuses
on the uneven effects of the negative shock associated with
the pandemic. There is broad consensus that these effects are
heterogeneous and may exacerbate pre-existing inequalities. Adams-Prassl et al. (2020)
examined data from the UK, US, and Germany, finding that
the likelihood of reduced working hours, job loss, and earnings
reductions is higher among workers in alternative employment arrangements, those
in occupations with limited potential for remote work, individuals with
lower educational attainment, and women. Similarly, Montenovo et al. (2020)
reported that, in the United States, job losses were more
pronounced in occupations requiring interpersonal contact and thus less amenable
to remote work. Gallacher and Hossain (2020), in their analysis
of the Canadian labor market, observed that the most significant
job losses between March and April occurred among workers with
limited opportunities to work from home.
