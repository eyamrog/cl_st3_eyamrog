In addition to the introduction and conclusion, this article is
organized as follows. Section 2 provides a concise overview of
key mainstream studies that challenge the orthodox assumptions underlying the
theoretical justification for capital account liberalization in emerging economies during
the 1990s. Section 3 reviews selected mainstream empirical studies that
inform recent recommendations regarding capital controls and macroprudential policies. Section
4 examines the effectiveness of capital controls and macroprudential policies
as discussed in the recent literature. Building on this analysis,
Section 5 outlines the principal orthodox models supporting the use
of capital controls, synthesizes the main findings of the selected
studies on the effectiveness of capital controls and prudential policies,
and traces the evolution of mainstream economic perspectives on financial
openness and capital controls from the period of liberalizing reforms
to the post-global financial crisis era.
