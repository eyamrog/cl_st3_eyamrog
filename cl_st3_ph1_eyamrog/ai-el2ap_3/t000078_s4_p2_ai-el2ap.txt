Due to the impact of sub-business districts (SBD) on the
economy, the identification of sub-centers has been extensively examined in
the international literature. However, there is a limited number of
studies addressing sub-center identification in large Brazilian cities. In this
article, a two-stage identification approach is proposed to reduce the
subjectivity associated with existing empirical methods. The first stage employs
an Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) approach to identify potential
SBD candidates. The second stage introduces the use of a
Hedonic Spatial Price Model, which represents an innovation in the
methodology by enabling the testing of the alternative hypothesis regarding
the existence of SBD.
