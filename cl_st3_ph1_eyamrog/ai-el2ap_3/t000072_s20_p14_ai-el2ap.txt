Plots I exhibited a slightly higher average number of species
per plot (12.6) compared to plots R (11.6). The diversity
indices (H') were also higher in plots I, ranging from
1.98 to 2.53, whereas in plots R they ranged from
1.74 to 2.02. Similarly, the equability indices (J) were greater
in plots I, with values between 0.82 and 0.95, while
plots R showed values ranging from 0.70 to 0.90 (Table
2).
