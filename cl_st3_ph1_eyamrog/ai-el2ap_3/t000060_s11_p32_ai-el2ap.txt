The term "formulation" was first introduced by Garfinkel and Sacks
(1970) to refer to practices employed by interactants to demonstrate
their understanding of segments of an interaction. These segments may
serve as opportunities for participants to formulate the conversation, which
involves describing, explaining, characterizing, explicating, translating, summarizing, providing the gist,
noting conformity with rules, or commenting on deviations from rules
(Garfinkel & Sacks, 1970, p. 350). An illustrative example of
this is the utterance “Pains—in your chest then.”
