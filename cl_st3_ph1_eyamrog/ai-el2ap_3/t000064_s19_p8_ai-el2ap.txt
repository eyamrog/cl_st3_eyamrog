The leaf mesophyll of control group plants was dorsiventral and
consisted of 21–25 layers of parenchyma, with cells elongated on
the adaxial side and gradually decreasing in height toward the
abaxial side, where they became more rounded in shape (Figure
6a, f). Both in vitro and greenhouse-grown plants also exhibited
a dorsiventral mesophyll (Figures 6d–e); however, the mesophyll in these
plants displayed a less dense cellular arrangement compared to the
mature leaves of the control group (Figures 6a, f). Furthermore,
in greenhouse, garden, and control plants, the mesophyll contained subepidermal
fibre fascicles on each leaf surface, with a higher abundance
observed in the control and garden plants (Figures 6a, f).
In contrast, these fibre fascicles were absent in the leaves
of in vitro-grown plants (Figure 6d).
