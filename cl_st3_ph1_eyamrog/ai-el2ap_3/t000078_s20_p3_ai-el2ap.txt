First, the results of the Global Moranâ€™s I test are
presented in Table 2, which reports the outcomes for the
employment variables using the previously discussed weighting matrices. All results
are statistically significant at the 1% level. The tests consistently
indicate positive spatial correlation, suggesting that employment levels are spatially
clustered such that areas with similar employment levels are located
near each other. This finding implies that the spatial distribution
of MSP employment is characterized by the concentration of similar
employment levels in neighboring areas.
