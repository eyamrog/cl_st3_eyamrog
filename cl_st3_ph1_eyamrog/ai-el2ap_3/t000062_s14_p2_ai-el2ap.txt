Sample units – To assess the effect of H. coronarium
on the composition of soil spider assemblages, a methodology similar
to that of Robertson et al. (2011) was employed. In
this study, three treatments were established, each with three replicates.
The primary difference from the approach of Robertson et al.
(2011) is that, in PEFI, the ongoing removal of invasive
plants has resulted in a limited number of areas affected
by H. coronarium. Study sites were selected based on their
proximity to minimize potential confounding influences from spatially distant areas.
Within the protected area, sufficient H. coronarium coverage was present
to allow for the implementation of all three treatments. The
treatments were defined as follows: (1) dominated areas (DA), where
H. coronarium exclusively covers the soil; (2) intermediate areas (IA),
where H. coronarium covers approximately 50% of the ground; and
(3) free areas (FA), where H. coronarium is absent. Each
sample unit comprised an area of 100 m² (see Figure
2a–c).
