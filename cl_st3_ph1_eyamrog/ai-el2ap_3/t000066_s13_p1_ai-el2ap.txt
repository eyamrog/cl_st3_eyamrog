Following the launch of the GPB on June 8, 2020,
workshops were made available, allowing Brigadiers to participate in weekly
meetings designed for the exchange of ideas, engagement in improvisational
activities, and the use of play and performance tools or
social therapy sessions. These meetings aimed to provide participants with
emotional support and personal development relevant to the activities and
initiatives promoted on the GPB website. Additionally, the meetings facilitated
collaboration among Brigadiers, enabling them to discuss and plan sessions
they intended to lead. In one such meeting, two Brigadiers
employed as English professors at government-owned colleges in SÃ£o Paulo,
Brazil, collaborated with a colleague from the same institution to
organize a workshop titled "Global Collaboration: What Can Young Professionals
Do?"
