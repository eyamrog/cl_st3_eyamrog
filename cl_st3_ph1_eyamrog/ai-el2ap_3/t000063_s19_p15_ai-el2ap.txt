Analysis of the official ANUIES reportsâ€™ databases indicates that total
applications increased by 6.5% from the 2019-2020 to the 2020-2021
academic years, rising from 2,053,348 to 2,186,739. Within this period,
applications to programs in natural sciences, mathematics, and statistics increased
by 21.5% (from 67,649 to 82,214), while applications to health
sciences programs increased by 17.1% (from 374,231 to 438,284). Thus,
during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, the growth
in first-year applications to scientific fields, including science and health
care, was substantially higher (21.5% and 17.1%, respectively) than the
overall increase observed across all fields of study (6.5%) (Fig.
5.a).
