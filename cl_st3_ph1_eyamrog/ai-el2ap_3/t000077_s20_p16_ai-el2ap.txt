With respect to employment status, the most notable difference is
observed within the public sector. Consequently, disparities in remote work
participation between salaried workers in the formal and informal sectors
appear to primarily reflect distinctions between the public and private
sectors, given the overrepresentation of public sector employees within the
formal sector. In the private sector, the difference in remote
work participation between individuals with formal contracts (9.52%) and those
without formal contracts (8.42%) was minimal.
