Figure 2 displays a clear monotonic trend, indicating that the
proportion of workers engaged in remote work increases notably from
the 60th wage percentile, with an even steeper rise observed
from the 80th percentile onward. This pattern suggests that the
effects of the pandemic exacerbated existing inequalities in the Brazilian
labor market, as higher-wage workers were disproportionately more likely to
have the opportunity to work from home.
