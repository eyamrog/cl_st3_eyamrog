For the empirical analysis, Probit models were employed to estimate
the conditional probability that individual 𝑖 works from home, given
a set of observable characteristics (𝑦𝑖 = 1|𝒙𝒊). This modeling
approach was selected because ordinary least squares (OLS) regression does
not account for the binary nature of the dependent variable
and does not restrict predicted probabilities to the [0,1] interval.
In accordance with Cameron and Trivedi (2005), the Probit model
ensures that 0 < 𝑝𝑖 < 1, as specified in
equation (1): <>, where Φ denotes the cumulative distribution function
of the standard normal distribution and 𝑥𝑖 represents the vector
of covariates detailed in Table 2. The marginal effects derived
from the Probit model are presented in equation (2): <>.
