The non-cichlid fishes of Lake Tanganyika, which exhibit lower species
diversification compared to the Cichlidae, have received limited scientific attention.
Nevertheless, they comprise 75 species across 11 families and display
an endemicity rate of 59%. While certain families, such as
Clupeidae and Latidae, have been the focus of ecological (Coulter
1976; Mannini et al. 1999), parasitological (Kmentová et al. 2018;
Kmentová et al. 2020), and genomic (De Keyzer et al.
2019) research, the Siluriformes remain understudied. Notably, Siluriformes account for
five of these 11 families (Bagridae, Claroteidae, Clariidae, Mochokidae, and
Malapteruridae), rendering Lake Tanganyika the most diverse lake globally in
terms of Siluriformes representation (Fermon 2007; Peart et al. 2014).
The present study therefore aims to investigate the Monogenea parasites
associated with this group.
