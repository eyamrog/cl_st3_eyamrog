In this study, a number of individuals were sampled; however,
the majority were young, which prevented identification at a specific
level. The observed species richness does not appear to be
associated with H. coronarium, in contrast to the findings for
V. minor reported by Bultman and De-Witt (2008). Instead, the
species richness may be related to anthropogenic impacts, as the
study area is adjacent to a dirt road with frequent
vehicle traffic and a high flow of residents and employees
working in the PEFI research areas, and is subject to
ongoing removal of this invasive plant.
