In Spinoza's Ethics, affectus are defined as the continuous variations
in an individual's power of acting (Spinoza, 2003, III, Def.
3), which arise from affectio, or the modifications experienced by
the body. The effects of these modifications are manifested as
affectus. Depending on the nature of the relations among bodies,
affectus can be classified as active, when they correspond to
an increase in perfection (joy), or passive, when they correspond
to a decrease in perfection (sadness). The increase or decrease
in an individual's power of acting, referred to as conatus,
results from encounters with other bodies. Consequently, such encounters can
either enhance or diminish an individual's power of acting.
