Despite the low species richness and the limited number of
adult individuals collected, a cluster analysis was conducted, revealing an
82% similarity in family composition between the IA and DA
treatments (Figure 4). The IA treatment exhibited the highest number
of species (14), followed by DA with nine species and
FA with four species (Table 1); however, the treatments were
not statistically differentiated from each other.
