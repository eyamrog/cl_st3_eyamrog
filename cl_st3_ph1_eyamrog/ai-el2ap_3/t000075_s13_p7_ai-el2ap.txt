Despite the emergence of new evidence, the mainstream economic literature
has generally not supported the use of capital controls as
an alternative policy tool for emerging economies. The authorsâ€™ recommendations
are grounded in the threshold approach, which posits that the
advantages of capital account liberalization may require a certain period
to materialize in emerging markets. Specifically, this approach suggests that
the positive effects of financial openness become significant only once
a particular level of financial integration, relative to GDP, has
been achieved.
