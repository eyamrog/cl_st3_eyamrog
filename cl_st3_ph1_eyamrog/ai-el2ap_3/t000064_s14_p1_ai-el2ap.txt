Plant material and treatments – The control group consisted of
five individuals of Vellozia squamata naturally occurring at Parque Ecológico
Burle Marx, Brasília, DF, Brazil, selected through convenience sampling based
on accessibility and apparent healthy condition. For detailed information on
climate and soil characteristics, refer to Bucci et al. (2006).
Voucher specimens were deposited in the UB herbarium under accession
numbers UB0028356 and UB0028358. Seeds were collected, germinated, and the
resulting plantlets were sectioned and subjected to the micropropagation protocol
described by Neto (2009). The main stages of this protocol
in the present study included: (a) cultivation of plantlets in
Murashige-Skoog medium supplemented with sucrose and the phytohormones kinetin, indole-butyric
acid, and gibberellin; (b) acclimatization of seedlings in a greenhouse
in pots containing soil; and (c) subsequent cultivation outdoors under
garden conditions. The experimental treatments were as follows: (a) plantlets
maintained in culture medium under photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) of
32 µmol m⁻² s⁻¹, a 12/12 h photoperiod, and a
controlled temperature of 27 ± 2 °C; (b) rooted seedlings
acclimatized in a greenhouse under partial shade, with a maximum
PAR of 412 µmol m⁻² s⁻¹, measured using an Apogee
Instruments® portable quantum sensor; and (c) micropropagated plants cultivated outdoors
in treated and fertilized soil, exposed to the natural environmental
conditions of the Cerrado, including the annual cycle of drought
and rainfall. Wild plants served as the control group.
