The infiltration capacity of the plinthic soil under riparian forest
was found to be intermediate when compared to values reported
for other tropical forests, such as the Amazon and Atlantic
Forest (Table 1). In general, elevated soil biological activity—including continuous
litter production, root growth and decay, and the presence of
soil fauna—combined with minimal disturbance from factors such as human
or animal trampling and the use of heavy machinery, is
associated with higher infiltration rates in forest soils (Bruijnzeel 1990;
Salemi et al. 2011).
