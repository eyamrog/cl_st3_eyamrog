This paper examines the recent developments in mainstream economic thought
regarding capital account liberalization and capital controls, with particular emphasis
on new empirical evidence and theoretical shifts following the global
financial crisis. To achieve this, a literature review was conducted,
focusing on highly regarded articles published in leading academic journals,
as well as working papers from the National Bureau of
Economic Research (NBER) and publications from the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), among others. The analysis suggests that recent mainstream models
represent a new phase in the theoretical treatment of capital
flow regulation. Currently, mainstream economics is more accepting of capital
controls, recognizing them as important policy tools available to central
banks. However, this shift does not constitute a complete turning
point, as significant limitations on the permanent use of such
regulatory measures persist, largely due to ongoing differences with the
Keynesian perspective on the contemporary international monetary and financial system.
