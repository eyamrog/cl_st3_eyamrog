Our results do not support the hypothesis that highly connected
species exert a stronger influence on trait evolution within mutualistic
networks (Table 3). The simulation outcomes indicate substantial variability in
mean trait disparity within scenarios and interaction types, as evidenced
by the 0.05 and 0.95 quantiles represented by the vertical
bars in Fig. 3a-b. Specifically, highly connected cheater species do
not generate higher levels of trait diversity compared to scenarios
in which cheating interactions are more evenly distributed across the
network (Fig. 3a). Additionally, the number of trait clusters observed
among species varies considerably between scenarios (Fig. 3b).
