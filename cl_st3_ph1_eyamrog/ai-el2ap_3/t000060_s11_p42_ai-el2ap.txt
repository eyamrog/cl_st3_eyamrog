While each formulation retains certain elements of the previously established
meaning, it simultaneously omits other elements and introduces new aspects
of meaning (Heritage and Watson, 1979, p. 129). Furthermore, there
is a reflexive relationship between the initial and subsequent versions:
formulations render explicit meanings that were previously implicit, or at
least are treated as if they were implied in the
prior version, while their local meaning is partially dependent on
the versions they are intended to replace. When analyzing the
semantic properties of formulations, it is essential to consider both
the sequential organization and the specific linguistic design of the
formulation (Deppermann, 2011, p. 122).
