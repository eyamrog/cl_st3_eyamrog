The cataloguing was conducted at the Parasitology Collection of the
Basic Pathology Department in the Biological Sciences Sector at the
Federal University of Paran√° (UFPR), which houses Culicidae specimens collected
by Dr. Ana Leuch Lozovei, her students, and collaborators. The
classification of Culicidae specimens followed the system proposed by Harbach
[12], with the classification of the tribe Aedini based on
Wilkerson et al. [13], and abbreviations adopted according to Reinert
[48].
