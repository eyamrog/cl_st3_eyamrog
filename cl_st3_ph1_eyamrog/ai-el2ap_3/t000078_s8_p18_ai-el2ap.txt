The SBD is characterized by the highest land prices, which
decrease proportionally with distance from the center, as well as
by the agglomeration of employment, serving as focal points for
firms and workers. The methodology employed by Plaut and Plaut
(1998) and Herman and Haddad (2005) may not be optimal
for identifying these centralities. Specifically, these studies utilized the error
term from a hedonic price econometric model, followed by the
application of the kriging technique. However, this approach may be
sensitive to the omission of relevant variables, such as unobservable
real estate characteristics or amenities that influence the price gradient.
