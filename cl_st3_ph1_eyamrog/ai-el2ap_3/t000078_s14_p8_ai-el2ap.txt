As these results may be influenced by the choice of
spatial weight matrices, robustness tests using alternative spatial matrices will
be conducted below to assess the internal validity of the
findings. Specifically, to evaluate the robustness of the weight matrix,
we allow for distance thresholds of 5% and 10%, thereby
increasing the initial cut-off and enabling the inclusion of larger
neighborhoods.
