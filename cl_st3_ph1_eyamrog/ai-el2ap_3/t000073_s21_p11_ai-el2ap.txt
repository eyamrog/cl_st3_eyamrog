Identification. This species is primarily characterized by a globose, compact
basidiome in its juvenile stage, which develops into a structure
with a basal portion resembling an inverted pear or a
loaf of bread at maturity. The surface is typically brown
and often exhibits a mosaic-like pattern of scales. At maturity,
the gleba becomes purplish and pulverulent (Zeller & Smith 1964;
Morales & Kimbrough 1978).
