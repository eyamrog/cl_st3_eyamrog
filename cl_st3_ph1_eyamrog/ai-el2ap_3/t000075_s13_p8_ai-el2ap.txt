The global financial crisis of 2007–2008 prompted a significant shift
in mainstream perspectives on capital account liberalization. In contrast to
the threshold approach to financial openness that characterized the period
between the crises in emerging economies and the global crisis,
recent mainstream studies increasingly advocate for the use of capital
controls in their policy recommendations. Two important clarifications should be
noted. First, capital controls and (macro)prudential policies targeting capital outflows
are designed to limit the outflow of domestic resources, rather
than to restrict the repatriation of investments by non-resident agents.
For instance, during the 1990s and 2000s, many emerging economies
further liberalized domestic capital outflows by easing restrictions on cross-border
financial activities—such as loans and investments—conducted by domestic residents, including
banking institutions, non-banking financial institutions (e.g., institutional investors), non-financial corporations,
and individuals. Second, the mainstream literature has increasingly adopted the
typology proposed by authors such as Ostry et al. (2010,
2011) and Ghosh et al. (2014), which defines capital controls
as regulatory measures that differentiate based on the residency of
the investor. For example, the imposition of the IOF tax
(Imposto sobre Operações Financeiras) on capital inflows from foreign investors
constitutes a capital control under this classification. In contrast, macroprudential
policies do not distinguish based on investor residency but rather
on the currency denomination of cross-border financial transactions; for example,
increasing restrictions on banking institutions’ ability to take open positions
in foreign currencies is considered a macroprudential policy, specifically classified
as a ‘foreign exchange-related measure’.
