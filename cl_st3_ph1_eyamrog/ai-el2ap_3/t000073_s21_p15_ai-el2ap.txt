Identification is primarily based on the presence of an orange
pigment that stains the basidioma upon cutting (Cortez et al.
2008). Additionally, the species is characterized by a long rhizomorphic
extension measuring 20–200 mm in diameter and 10–100 mm in
height, which is typically folded at the base and attached
by one or more thin rhizomorphs (Wright & Albertó 2006).
