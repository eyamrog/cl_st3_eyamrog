It is important to note that the number of species
reported for Rio Branco and Xapuri may differ from the
values presented in Table 2, as one of the referenced
articles combined results for both municipalities. Consequently, for this particular
article, all species records were grouped under the designation "Bujari/Rio
Branco/Xapuri" in Table 2. Additionally, there is an issue concerning
Psychodopygus corossoniensis, which is the only record for the state;
the author did not specify the municipality where the specimens
were collected, providing only the location reference "AC Highway Km
22." As a result, the municipality for this observation is
recorded as not available (NA).
