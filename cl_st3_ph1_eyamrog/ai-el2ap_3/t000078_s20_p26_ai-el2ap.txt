As described in the previous section, the coefficients of the
CBD variable estimated by OLS are robust across different functional
forms and model specifications, consistently exhibiting the expected signs in
all models (Table 4, columns 5–8). However, these models display
spatial dependence. When the model is estimated with SBD control
using the SLX estimator, the total effect of the CBD
variable also shows the expected signs for both spatial weight
matrices considered (Table 6, columns 18 and 19). These results
confirm the validity of the econometric estimation and provide empirical
support for the polycentric hypothesis in São Paulo.
