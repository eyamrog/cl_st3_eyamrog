From this perspective, the concept of biocoloniality is applied to
biodiversity management (Beltrán 2016), based on the premise that modern
science is regarded as the sole authority capable of discerning
truths and validating concepts. This perspective stems from a dominant
cultural rationale that originated with colonial domination and has been
perpetuated by modernity in various spheres—including political, social, and religious—over
Indigenous populations.
