The passage examines the use of the formulation introduced by
the discourse markers "and" and "so" in the phrase “And
so... when you’re saying you’re not sure.” Martinez introduces his
formulation with the conclusion “and so you’re saying,” while also
maintaining the content of Arias’s statement by essentially reiterating her
uncertainty. He then challenges her response by asking, “you were
a little bit more sure under direct examination weren’t you?”
This formulation omits her explicit expression of uncertainty and reframes
it to suggest an alternative interpretation: if she was previously
more certain, it raises the question of why she is
now uncertain. Martinez continues to seek more precise information that
could support his argument, as demonstrated by his subsequent prompt,
“But you were more... sure about the time... do you
remember back to you?”
