Carbohydrates are associated with the seed's ability to tolerate desiccation
and storage at subzero temperatures, as well as with various
structural and biochemical properties. Mollo et al. (2011) demonstrated that
the carbohydrates present in the seeds of Alcantarea imperialis (Carrière)
Harms (Bromeliaceae) activate adaptive mechanisms in response to cold when
seeds are exposed to low temperatures in growth chambers (5
± 2 °C, 15 ± 2 °C, 15 °C dark
/ 30 °C light, and 30 ± 2 °C, with
a 12-hour photoperiod). According to these authors, under cold conditions,
sucrose in the seeds can be replaced by trehalose, raffinose,
and stachyose. Additionally, starch concentrations were observed to change in
response to cold, likely being converted into carbohydrates that contribute
to the plant's cold tolerance and protection (Mollo et al.
2011). Therefore, it can be inferred that prolonged attachment of
fruits to the mother plant after anthesis results in greater
carbohydrate accumulation, as the present study indicates that higher days
after anthesis (DAA) at the time of fruit collection correspond
to increased water loss in the seeds.
