Spiders were collected using pitfall traps constructed from 2-liter plastic
pots, each with an opening measuring 18 Ã— 13 cm
and a depth of 12 cm (Figure 2d). Each trap
was filled with 500 ml of water mixed with neutral
detergent and was removed 48 hours after installation. A total
of 45 pitfall traps were collected each month over the
course of one year, with five traps placed in each
replicate. The traps were positioned such that one was located
at the center of the sampling unit, while the remaining
four were placed 1.5 meters from each vertex towards the
center (Figure 3).
