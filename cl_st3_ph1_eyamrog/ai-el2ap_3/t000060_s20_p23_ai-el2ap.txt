In the example above, the discourse marker well is used
twice to allow speakers additional time to organize their thoughts
and elaborate their responses. Additionally, the marker you know is
observed, serving primarily a social function within the interaction. Such
discourse markers are prevalent in spoken language and contribute to
the management and progression of conversational turns. Specifically, the use
of you know enables speakers to seek implicit agreement or
understanding from their interlocutors, thereby reducing the likelihood of disagreement.
This marker encourages listeners to align with the speakerâ€™s perspective
or discourages dissent, functioning as a strategy to minimize the
potential for conflict or communicative disruption.
