Climatic changes and ongoing environmental modifications have led to significant
shifts in biodiversity, particularly within insect populations, where increased dispersion
is observed, especially among species of medical and epidemiological relevance.
The data presented in this study may serve as a
valuable resource for future research on ecological, environmental, and biodiversity-related
topics, with a particular focus on medically important species within
the “One Health” framework. Notably, the current collection includes 18
species recorded for the first time in the state of
Paraná, providing a significant reference for studies on mosquito biodiversity.
These findings underscore the importance of maintaining and regularly updating
biological collections.
