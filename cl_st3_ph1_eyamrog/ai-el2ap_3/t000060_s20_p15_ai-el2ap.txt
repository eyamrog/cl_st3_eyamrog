The initial component of this type of question is a
statement that allows the lawyer to present their version of
events or relevant information. The subsequent component is a tag,
which applies various forms of interactive pressure on the witness
and serves a social function. This structure exemplifies the alignment
between linguistic form and pragmatic function in courtroom discourse. Consequently,
it is common for cross-examination questions to incorporate tags, and
a wide range of tag types can be observed in
this context, including some that are infrequent in everyday conversation.
