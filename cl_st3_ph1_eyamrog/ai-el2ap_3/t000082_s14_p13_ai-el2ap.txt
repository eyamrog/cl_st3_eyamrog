Some species do not provide benefits to any of their
interaction partners and rely exclusively on cheating interactions (Bronstein 2001).
We hypothesize that species that are exclusive cheaters may amplify
the effects of cheating interactions, resulting in greater impacts on
trait distributions than those observed in simulations where the same
number of cheating interactions are randomly distributed across all ecological
interactions (see previous set of simulations). We further expect that
this effect will be more pronounced if the exclusive cheater
species are highly connected or occupy central positions within the
network structure. To investigate the influence of these exclusive, highly
connected cheater species on coevolutionary outcomes, we identified the most
connected species in the network and designated them as exclusively
involved in cheating interactions. Degree centrality (Newman 2018), a standardized
measure of the number of interactions a species has within
the mutualistic network, was used for this purpose. The weighted
degree centrality \(C_i\) for a species \(i\) from a given
set (e.g., floral visitors) is calculated as \(C_i = k_i
/ N_o\), where \(k_i\) is the number of interactions of
species \(i\) and \(N_o\) is the species richness of the
opposite set (e.g., if species \(i\) is a floral visitor,
the opposite set comprises flowering plants). We computed a z-score
to identify species with extreme centrality values, using \(S_i =
(C_i - \overline{C}) / \sigma\), where \(\overline{C}\) is the mean
degree centrality of the network and \(\sigma\) is the standard
deviation of degree centrality values. To assess the effect of
central cheater species on trait evolution, we designated all species
with \(S_i > 1\) as exclusive cheaters, thereby creating a
network in which the most central species function as obligate
cheaters, referred to as the Central scenario.
