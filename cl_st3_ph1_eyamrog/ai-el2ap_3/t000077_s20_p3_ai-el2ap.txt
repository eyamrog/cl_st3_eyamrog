The disparity between the highest and lowest share values of
remote work, as illustrated in Figure 1, is substantial. The
occupational category comprising kindergarten, elementary, and high school teachers, as
well as college professors, exhibited the highest average share of
remote work, approaching 80% during the observed period. This finding
is consistent with the results of Crowley and Doran (2020),
who also identified a high potential for remote work within
this category in their study of the Irish labor market.
