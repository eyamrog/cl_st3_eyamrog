We propose a two-stage approach that integrates the a priori
identification of sub-central business district (SBD) candidates into the hedonic
price model. In the first stage, all potential SBD candidates
are identified using an exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) method.
In the second stage, the hedonic house price model is
estimated, incorporating as explanatory variables the distances to the SBD
candidates identified in the first stage. This two-stage strategy allows
for control over potential overidentification that may arise from relying
solely on employment concentration at the centroid of each polygon.
In both stages, it is possible to test the null
hypothesis that each region does not constitute an SBD.
