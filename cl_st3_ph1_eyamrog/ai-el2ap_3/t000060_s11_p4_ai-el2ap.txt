It is also important to consider that turn allocation can
occur in conversation. Unlike the prototypical sequence of “Question 1-Answer
1-Question 2-Answer 2” (Q1-A1-Q2-A2), not all first pair parts necessarily
receive their corresponding second pair parts immediately. In some cases,
the response to an initial question is delayed due to
the intervention of another question-answer sequence. Yule (1996, p. 77)
describes this as a sequence taking the form Q1-Q2-A2-A1, where
the intervening pair (Q2-A2) is referred to as an insertion
sequence. In this structure, the Q2-A2 pair is embedded within
the Q1-A1 pair, and thus functions as an insertion sequence.
Yule further notes that although Q2 appears to be a
question in response to Q1, it is generally assumed that
once the second part (A2) of the insertion sequence is
provided, the second part (A1) of the initial question (Q1)
will subsequently occur. As Coulthard and Brazil (1992, p. 52)
observe:
