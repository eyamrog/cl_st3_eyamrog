Several strategies have been employed to enhance the understanding and
conservation of Bromeliads. In the case of V. reitzii, biotechnological
approaches such as in vitro cultivation and the production of
nodular cultures (NCs) have been utilized as conservation tools. NCs
represent a morphogenic response with high regenerative capacity, demonstrated by
their ability to generate over 5,300 microshoots per gram within
10 weeks of cultivation, originating from either the leaf base
(Dal Vesco & Guerra 2010; Guerra & Dal Vesco 2010;
Dal Vesco et al. 2014a) or seeds (Dal Vesco et
al. 2014b). Research has included morphological and histochemical characterization of
NC induction and origin (Corredor-Prado et al. 2015), proteomic analyses
and identification of differentially expressed proteins during NC induction and
regeneration (Corredor-Prado et al. 2016, 2019), as well as investigations
into the dynamics of protein, carbohydrate, and global DNA methylation
levels during NC induction (Corredor-Prado et al. 2020).
