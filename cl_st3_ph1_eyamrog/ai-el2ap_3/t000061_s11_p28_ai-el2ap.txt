It is necessary to revisit a central controversy regarding the
formative potential of mimesis, particularly the debate between Plato and
Aristotle concerning the alleged passivity associated with mimetic learning. The
assertion that Undergraduate Student Research (USR) promotes moral learning through
mimetic behavior does not imply that students will automatically become
accomplished researchers. As Wulf (2016: 559), drawing on Benjamin, states,
imitation should not be understood as mere copying, but rather
as the creation of an image that, while based on
a model, is not a direct replica. This process involves
the individual's active engagement in generating similarities by addressing gaps,
as illustrated in the provided example. Therefore, the educational value
of mimesis lies in the fact that imitation constitutes an
active process through which learners attempt to integrate themselves into
a domain to which they do not yet fully belong
(Benjamin, 1987), such as young adults seeking initiation into the
academic community.
