A significant area of recent research on capital controls involves
the comparative analysis, using various methodologies, of the effectiveness of
capital controls implemented by emerging and developing economies versus the
financial regulatory measures adopted by developed countries. The latter are
typically characterized by prudential regulations that, even if indirectly, influence
the outward investment activities of domestic agents. Several studies indicate
that prudential measures imposed by developed countries on capital outflows
are more effective in managing cross-border financial flows than the
inflow controls implemented by emerging economies. The evidence summarized below
is particularly relevant in the context of ongoing debates regarding
the multilateral dimensions of capital controls and the necessity for
international coordination between capital-receiving and capital-originating countries.
