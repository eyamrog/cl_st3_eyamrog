Insects of the family Culicidae (order Diptera), commonly referred to
as mosquitoes, exhibit a broad geographic distribution. Currently, 3,591 species
have been described, classified into two subfamilies (Anophelinae and Culicinae)
and distributed across 113 genera, with approximately 31% of these
species occurring in the Neotropical region. In Brazil, 530 species
have been recorded, representing 23 genera present in all biomes,
of which six species are endemic to the country. In
the state of Paran√°, 191 Culicidae species have been documented;
however, this number is likely to increase as research efforts
intensify, given the epidemiological significance of this group.
