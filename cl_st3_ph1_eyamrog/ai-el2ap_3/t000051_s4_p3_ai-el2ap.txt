The shift is framed as a necessity rather than a
choice, aimed at safeguarding Germany’s security against Russian aggression “today
and in the future.” Although a prolonged conflict with Russia
and a fundamental change in diplomatic stance are anticipated, the
war in Ukraine is characterized as “Putin’s war,” depicted as
an act of aggression by an isolated leader lacking domestic
support. Consequently, the primary concern appears to be Putin’s challenge
to the NATO-led international order, rather than an immediate military
threat, which in Scholz’s view marks the beginning of a
new era and is reflected in an implicit regime change
narrative. Scholz’s interpretation of Putin’s motives relies solely on the
fact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with no additional justification
provided, as his perspective is grounded in the context of
NATO hegemony (see Section 3). The invasion is presented without
reference to its broader context or historical background, serving as
sufficient grounds for making extensive claims about Putin’s intentions and
ambitions, which are not substantiated by detailed political or historical
analysis. Alternative perspectives, such as the argument that Putin pursued
dialogue over several decades, are dismissed (see example 6). Instead,
through strategies of neutralization (Baxter, 2011, p. 171; Deetz, 1992),
the conflict is constructed as a binary struggle between good
and evil, or the free world versus oppression.
