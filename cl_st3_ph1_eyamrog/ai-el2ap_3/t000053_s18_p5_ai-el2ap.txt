All scientific articles and books were reviewed to extract data
corresponding to 32 standardized variables defined by Darwin Core Terms
(Darwin Core, 2022) (Table 1). These variables were categorized into
four groups to facilitate the identification of the dataset, description
of essential information regarding specimen condition and quantity, documentation of
capture location and methods, and determination of the taxonomic status
for each observation (Table 1).
