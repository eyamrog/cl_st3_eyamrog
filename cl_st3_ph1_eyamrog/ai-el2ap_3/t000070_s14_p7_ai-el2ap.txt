Representative seed samples were fixed in 2.5% paraformaldehyde solution prepared
in 0.2 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.2 for 72
hours at 4 °C for anatomical analysis. Dehydration was performed
using a graded ethanol series (0–100 °Gl), followed by pre-infiltration
in a 1:1 (v/v) solution of 100% ethanol and glycol
methacrylate (GMA) historesin for 6 hours. The samples were then
infiltrated with Historesin (Leica Historesin, Heidelberg, Germany) and embedded in
histological molds at 35 °C in an oven for 24
hours.
