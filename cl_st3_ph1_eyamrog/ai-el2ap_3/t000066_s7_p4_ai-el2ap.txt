In Brazil, this occurred with the formation of the Brincadas
group, an initiative launched by the LACE Research Group following
the participation of its leader, Fernanda Liberali, in the GPB.
Brincadas subsequently developed into a Brazilian community that provided support
to educators, principals, coordinators, parents, and students within school settings,
as well as assistance to individuals in need through the
distribution of food, medicine, and opportunities for social interaction. Additionally,
the group implemented various intervention services via national campaigns and
international sponsorships, including the donation of masks and other personal
protective equipment to healthcare professionals who were required to address
the challenges of COVID-19 without sufficient governmental support at that
time.
