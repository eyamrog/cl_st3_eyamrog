Job losses in Brazil were disproportionately higher among employees without
a formal contract. Bridi (2020) reports that, between the first
and second quarters of 2020, the number of private sector
workers with a formal contract declined by 8.9%, whereas the
reduction among those without a formal contract was 21.6%. However,
among informal workers who retained their jobs, the rate of
participation in remote work was similar to that observed in
the formal private sector (Figure 3).
