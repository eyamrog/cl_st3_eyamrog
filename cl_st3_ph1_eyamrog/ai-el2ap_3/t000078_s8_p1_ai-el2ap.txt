Employment decentralization within cities is a significant factor contributing to
urban landscape transformation, affecting wages, housing prices, transportation demand, and
commuting patterns (Fujita and Ogawa, 1982; Anas and Kim, 1990;
Helsley and Sullivan, 1991). This decentralization is primarily driven by
the process of suburbanization (Glaser and Kahn, 2001), in which
economic activity expands from the central business district (CBD) toward
the urban periphery, capitalizing on relative advantages in transportation costs,
wages, and land prices (McMillen and Smith, 2003). According to
McMillen (2001b), urban growth facilitates the emergence of substantial employment
concentrations outside the CBD, a pattern commonly observed in large
American cities where suburbs accommodate significant numbers of households, offices,
and jobs. In certain cases, suburban areas employ more workers
than the city center itself (McMillen, 2001a). The development of
these new sub-centralities has a considerable impact on urban structure,
and the urban economics literature typically refers to these employment
clusters as employment subcenters or Small Business Districts (SBDs).
