Cross-country studies indicate that capital flow management measures (CFMs) are
relatively effective in enhancing monetary policy autonomy, extending the maturity
of external liabilities, and mitigating credit booms, although the latter
objective is primarily achieved through macroprudential policies. In contrast, evidence
regarding the effectiveness of CFMs in countering exchange rate appreciation
pressures is mixed, and there is limited support for their
ability to significantly reduce the net volume of capital flows.
These findings are primarily drawn from the works of Magud
et al. (2011), Habermeier et al. (2011), Fern√°ndez et al.
(2015), Aizenman and Binici (2016), Pasricha et al. (2018), and
Forbes et al. (2016). Figure 1 summarizes the main conclusions
on the effectiveness of CFMs as identified through the joint
analysis of these studies.
