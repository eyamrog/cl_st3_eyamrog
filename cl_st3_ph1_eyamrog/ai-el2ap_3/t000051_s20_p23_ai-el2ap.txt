A latent discourse of intra-EU discipline is evident at the
level of implicit communication, as seen in the characterization of
preserving “Geschlossenheit” (translated as ‘unity’, though the official translation uses
the more militaristic term “united front”) as an opportunity. This
is further reflected in the dialogically contractive assertion that unity
requires member states to prioritize the interests of the Union
as a whole over national interests when making decisions in
Brussels. This discourse is linked to the narrative of a
historical turning point (“die Zeitenwende […] trifft ganz Europa”, ‘the
watershed affects all of Europe’), indicating that the new reality
being constructed by German politicians is intended to encompass all
of Europe.
