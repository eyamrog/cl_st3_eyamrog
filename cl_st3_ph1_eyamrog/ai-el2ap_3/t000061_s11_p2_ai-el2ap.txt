According to Plato (1997), the human inclination to engage in
mimetic behavior is both strong and pervasive. This tendency is
attributed to the pleasurable aspects of the mimetic experience, which
is regarded as an aesthetic experience that fosters a sense
of fulfillment and connection with nature and the environment. Through
the observation of their surroundings and the imitation of images
and behaviors, individuals learn by representing and internalizing these models.
Plato (1997) argues that the propensity for imitation is so
pronounced that it warrants restricting young people's exposure to artistic
works, as art is considered an imperfect representation of reality;
instead, conceptual reasoning is viewed as the preferred means of
accessing true knowledge. Additionally, Plato expresses concern that art may
present negative examples, particularly in the context of Greek tragedy
and comedy, which could be emulated by young people (Gagnebin,
1993; Wulf, 2008). Furthermore, Plato (1991) criticizes mimesis for its
passive nature, characterizing it as a mere reproduction of existing
forms and lacking creative agency on the part of the
imitator. Consequently, Plato rejects the use of mimetic behavior as
an educational tool for the development of young individuals.
