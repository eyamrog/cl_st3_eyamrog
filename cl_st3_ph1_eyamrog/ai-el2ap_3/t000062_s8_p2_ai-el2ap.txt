Hedychium coronarium J. KÃ¶nig (Zingiberaceae), commonly known as the "White
garland-lily," is a monocotyledonous invasive alien species of significant ecological
impact. It exhibits a herbaceous growth habit and demonstrates a
competitive advantage over native species due to its rapid growth
rate and distinctive phytochemical properties (Castro 2013). The species produces
aromatic inflorescences that attract nocturnal pollinators, such as moths, primarily
from January to March. Seed dispersal is facilitated by birds
(Ferreira et al. 2016). Additionally, H. coronarium propagates asexually through
rhizomes, enabling it to outcompete and displace native vegetation (Santos
et al. 2005).
