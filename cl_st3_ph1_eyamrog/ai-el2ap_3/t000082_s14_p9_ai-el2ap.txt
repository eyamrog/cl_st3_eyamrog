This study investigates the impact of varying frequencies of cheating
interactions on coevolutionary dynamics. Specifically, it examines how changes in
the prevalence of cheating behaviors influence the evolutionary trajectories of
both cheaters and their cooperative counterparts. By systematically manipulating the
frequency of cheating within experimental or simulated populations, the research
aims to elucidate the resulting effects on adaptation rates, stability
of cooperative strategies, and the potential emergence of counter-adaptations. The
findings are expected to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding
of the mechanisms underlying coevolution in systems where cheating is
a recurrent interaction.
