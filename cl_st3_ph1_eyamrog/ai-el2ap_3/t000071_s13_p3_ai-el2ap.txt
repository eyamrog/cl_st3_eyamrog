In the initial phase of the study, conducted from July
to December 2018, we systematically reviewed Beall’s 2017 list and
identified 50 publishers and 51 standalone journals utilizing Open Journal
Systems (OJS). We contacted the publishers and editors by email,
informing them of their inclusion on Beall’s list and offering
guidance on improving their journal websites. Of those contacted, 14
publishers (representing 113 journals) and two standalone journals expressed interest
in receiving assistance. We subsequently reviewed sample journals from each
publisher, using Beall’s Criteria for Determining Predatory Open-Access Publishers as
a reference. These criteria include indicators such as the absence
of a named editor for specific journals and the presence
of optional, fee-based expedited peer review services that may guarantee
publication with minimal or no vetting. Following our outreach, two
publishers, Scholar Science Journals and Khalsa Publisher, implemented several website
improvements within one month, while COES&RJ (Center of Excellence for
Scientific & Research Journalism) reported that it was acting on
our recommendations. Additionally, three of the fourteen publishers indicated that
they had unsuccessfully requested removal from Beall’s list, and a
fourth publisher succeeded in having Beall acknowledge its inclusion in
the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ).
