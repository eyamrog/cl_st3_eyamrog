The study analyzed 568 journals, each with a median of
166 signed articles. The median percentage of papers by the
most prolific author (PPMP) was 4.5%, with the 95th percentile
at 12.9%. The median Gini coefficient was 0.149, with the
95th percentile at 0.310. An increase in journal size was
associated with a higher PPMP and a lower Gini coefficient.
Journals indexed in MEDLINE exhibited lower PPMP values and higher
Gini coefficients compared to non-MEDLINE journals; however, these differences were
not observed after reweighting the data.
