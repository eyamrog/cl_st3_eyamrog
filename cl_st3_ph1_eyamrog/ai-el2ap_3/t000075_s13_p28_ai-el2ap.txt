Aizenman and Binici (2016) make a significant contribution to the
literature by analyzing the effects of capital flows and capital
flow management measures (CFMs) on exchange rates and international reserves
in both emerging and OECD countries during the period 2000â€“2014,
focusing specifically on their impact on exchange market pressure (EMP).
Their findings indicate that the implementation of CFMs by OECD
countries alleviated some of the pro-cyclical pressures on EMP, with
regulatory measures targeting capital inflows proving to be substantially more
effective than those targeting outflows. In contrast, the use of
CFMs by emerging economies did not significantly reduce the pro-cyclical
pressures associated with short-term capital flows on EMP, despite these
countries employing such measures more frequently and intensively. Aizenman and
Binici (2016, p. 86) conclude that while capital controls can
mitigate exposure to capital flow volatility, their effectiveness is contingent
upon institutional quality and tends to be higher in OECD
countries compared to more vulnerable emerging market economies.
