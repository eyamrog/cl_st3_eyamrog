The historically documented Russian position (see Section 4) is represented
here by the discourse of indivisible security, which is characterized
as centrifugal. As previously discussed, the marginalization of this discourse
contributes to the reinforcement of Putin’s war narrative by portraying
the concept of indivisible security as a notion exclusively associated
with Putin, rather than as a legitimate subject of international
debate. This perspective is further supported by the prevalent watershed
discourse, which maintains that Putin will remain a security threat
for the foreseeable future, thereby delegitimizing alternative discourses on indivisible
security and calls for diplomatic engagement. When alternative viewpoints are
acknowledged, they typically advocate for a more confrontational approach than
Putin’s own, such as supporting the cessation of dialogue with
Russia or asserting that values such as freedom, tolerance, and
human rights are generally absent in the Russian context.
