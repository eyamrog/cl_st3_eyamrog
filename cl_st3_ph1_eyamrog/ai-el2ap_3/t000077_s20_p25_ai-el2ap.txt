With respect to age, the models indicate that the probability
of remote work is higher for workers aged 16 to
19 years, except when compared to those aged 60 to
65. Although the marginal effects associated with age are small,
this finding is notable because it initially appears to contrast
with the results presented in Figure 3. When controlling for
all other observable characteristics (Table 3), younger workers are somewhat
more likely to work remotely than older workers. However, when
these characteristics are not controlled for, the participation of young
workers in remote work is lower than that of other
age groups (Figure 3). As discussed by Yasenov (2020) and
Gallacher and Hossain (2020), the lower participation rate of young
workers in remote work, relative to their total population, is
likely attributable to their concentration in occupations that are less
amenable to remote work. Specifically, 41% of workers aged 16
to 19 were employed in occupations such as store salesperson,
farmer/gardener, office clerk, bricklayer and related roles, and production assistant,
all of which have a very low incidence of remote
work (see Figure 1). Furthermore, only 1.2% of young workers
were employed in the public sector. Therefore, the result observed
in Figure 3 reflects the occupational distribution of young workers
rather than an intrinsic age effect.
