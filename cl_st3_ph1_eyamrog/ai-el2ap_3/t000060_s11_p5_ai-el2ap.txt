During the inserted sequence, the original question maintains its transition
relevance, and if the second speaker does not subsequently provide
an answer, the absence of a response is as apparent
as it would be without the intervening sequence. The questioner
can address the lack of an answer in the same
manner in both cases. This supports the argument that adjacency
pairs function as normative structures in which the occurrence of
the second pair part is expected. Consequently, other sequences can
be considered as being inserted between the initial pair part
and the anticipated second pair part.
