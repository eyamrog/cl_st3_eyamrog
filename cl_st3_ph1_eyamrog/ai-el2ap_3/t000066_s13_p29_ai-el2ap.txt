For college students and young professionals participating in the workshop,
the conversation had a notable impact, as they were able
to relate it to their own experiences with the challenges
of online learning, the state of the job market in
their region, and their personal strategies for managing various demands.
These responses are consistent with the Spinozian concept of affectus,
which refers to the transformation of the self through the
formation of positive interactions with others (Spinoza, 2003). Excerpts 2
and 3 present additional testimonials that illustrate the extent to
which participants felt comfortable sharing their experiences during the workshop.
