The primary centripetal discourses identified are the "watershed" and "Putin’s
war" discourses, which are prominent due to their high frequency
and the specific engagement strategies employed in their articulation. The
watershed discourse frames the invasion of Ukraine as a transformative
event necessitating a fundamental paradigm shift, as articulated three days
after the onset of the conflict. This invasion is characterized
as an unprecedented act of aggression in Europe since World
War II, perpetrated by an isolated and ruthless aggressor with
the intent to eliminate Ukraine as a sovereign state and
to expand Russian territorial ambitions. This perspective is herein referred
to as the "Putin’s war" discourse.
