Adolescents and young adults frequently post selfies on social media
to attain popularity, recognition, and appreciation (McLean et al., 2019).
Chua and Chang (2016) found that adolescents identified peer recognition
as the primary motivation for sharing selfies, suggesting that both
the quantity and positivity of feedback significantly influence self-esteem and
perceived social acceptance. Conversely, when posts do not receive the
anticipated number of "likes" or comments, individuals may experience reduced
well-being (Jong & Drummond, 2016). The association between social media
photo sharing and well-being among young people underscores the relevance
of investigating selfie-related behaviors. Advancing knowledge in this area is
particularly important, as adolescence represents a critical period for identity
formation, self-image, and social relationships, all of which may be
affected by engagement with selfie practices.
