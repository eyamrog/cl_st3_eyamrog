While Borges (2015) reported only partial success in the micropropagation
of V. sincorana, Neto (2009) successfully micropropagated V. squamata. Some
individuals of micropropagated V. squamata were subsequently planted in gardens,
where they have continued to grow for over a decade
and have reached approximately 20 cm in height (Figure 5e;
C.E.S. Silveira, unpublished data). These results indicate that the in
vitro propagation protocol for Vellozia squamata was effective in overcoming
factors that typically result in high seedling mortality when propagation
is attempted via seeds.
