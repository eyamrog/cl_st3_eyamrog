According to Van Huylenbroeck et al. (1998) and Kaur (2015),
in vitro propagated plants can be classified into two functional
categories with respect to their transition from the in vitro
to the greenhouse phase: those that are photosynthetically incapable, in
which the leaves function primarily as storage organs for sprouting,
and those that are photosynthetically active, with leaves exhibiting at
least partial development. In the latter group, it is commonly
observed that during the initial days following transplantation, plants exhibit
a pronounced acute stress response, characterized by elevated rates of
transpiration and respiration, as well as a potential reduction in
chlorophyll content (photobleaching) (Van Huylenbroeck et al., 1998; Kaur, 2015).
