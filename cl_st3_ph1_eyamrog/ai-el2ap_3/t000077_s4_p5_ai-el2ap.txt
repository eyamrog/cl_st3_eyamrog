Several variables continued to exhibit significant independent effects after controlling
for fixed effects related to types of work. Notably, higher
educational attainment (specifically, holding a college degree), being a salaried
employee (as opposed to being self-employed or an employer), and
higher labor income were all positively associated with the probability
of engaging in remote work. These findings suggest that the
likelihood of remote work varies not only across different occupations
but also within the same occupational categories. Additionally, holding other
factors constant, younger workers, women, and white workers demonstrated a
somewhat higher probability of working remotely.
