Content validity was also assessed, reflecting the extent to which
abstract concepts are accurately represented by observable and measurable indicators
of the construct under investigation (Wynd et al., 2003). This
form of validity evaluates the relevance and representativeness of each
scale item in relation to the specific construct and the
intended purpose of the assessment (Haynes et al., 1995). In
this study, content validity was examined through factor analysis and
by an expert committee, which consisted of the studyâ€™s authors,
following a procedure similar to that described by Toledo Junior
et al. (2018).
