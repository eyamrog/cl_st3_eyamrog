The methodology for this study was developed based on a
review of several published articles. It was noted that sampling
methodologies varied considerably among studies, particularly with respect to plot
size. However, the use of a 25 cm x 25
cm quadrat and sampling to a depth of 5 cm
was consistent across the articles reviewed (Braga et al. 2008;
Martins et al. 2008; Martins 2009; Franco et al. 2012;
Cerón 2015; Correia & Martins 2015; Kunz & Martins 2016).
To increase the likelihood of capturing a greater number of
seeds, this study adopted a sampling depth of 0–10 cm,
as described in detail below.
