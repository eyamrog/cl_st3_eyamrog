Since 1967, the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE)
has systematically collected data on population characteristics, education, labor, income,
and housing through the National Household Sample Surveys (PNADs). In
2016, the survey was restructured as the Continuous PNAD, which
is conducted quarterly to monitor fluctuations in the labor force
and to provide comprehensive socioeconomic indicators.
