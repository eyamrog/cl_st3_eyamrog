Our results indicate that incorporating the selection pressures imposed by
cheating interactions, which naturally arise within mutualisms, is essential for
a comprehensive understanding of coevolutionary dynamics in species-rich mutualistic systems.
Cheating interactions alter the outcomes of mutualistic coevolution by increasing
interspecific trait variation and promoting trait clustering. This study provides
insights into the effects of multiple interaction types within ecological
networks and demonstrates how contrasting selective forces can drive both
trait convergence and divergence among interacting species (Sauve et al.
2016). The structure of simulated networks changed significantly with increased
frequencies of cheating interactions, raising new questions regarding the balance
of positive and negative effects that sustain the structure of
empirical networks. Our theoretical predictions may also contribute to understanding
how ecological networks could evolve in response to rapid environmental
change, particularly as anthropogenic impacts lead to the loss of
interactions, with potentially unknown consequences for ecosystem functioning.
