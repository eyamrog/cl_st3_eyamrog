The discussion does not depend on whether the exchange structure
consists of two or three parts. As Sinclair (1992, p.
85) notes, the issue cannot be resolved simply by quantifying
the occurrences of two-part versus three-part exchanges. Instead, it is
necessary to investigate the underlying factors that account for the
variability observed in exchange structures.
