The desired changes include the promotion of respect and inclusivity,
the elimination of hate speech, increased recognition and respect for
scientific knowledge, and the affirmation of the rights and dignity
of Black individuals and LGBTQI+ communities. Additionally, there is a
call for greater interdisciplinary collaboration that benefits society as a
whole, enhanced respect for cultural diversity, and improvements in housing
systems.
