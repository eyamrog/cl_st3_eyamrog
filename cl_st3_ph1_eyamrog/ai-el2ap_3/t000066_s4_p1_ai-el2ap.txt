In response to the global pandemic, GPB can be characterized
as an international community whose collaborative orientation, drawing on Spinozian
concepts, has influenced partners across various sectors and practices, with
the aim of promoting transformative actions on a global scale.
This approach is based on the recognition of the necessity
to address and overcome oppressive conditions in pursuit of the
common good. It involves both the exploration of strategies to
confront existing challenges and the implementation of concrete actions. This
activist perspective acknowledges the urgency of social change and emphasizes
that such change relies on sustained political and ethical engagement.
Critical engagement is thus identified as essential for achieving justice,
more equitable living conditions, and improved well-being worldwide.
