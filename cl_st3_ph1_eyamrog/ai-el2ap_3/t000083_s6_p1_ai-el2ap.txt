The cross-cultural adaptation of a scale necessitates careful procedures to
ensure equivalence between the original and the translated versions, with
particular attention to contextual appropriateness and comprehensibility for the target
population. In this study, all relevant international guidelines for high-quality
translation and cross-cultural adaptation were followed, including those proposed by
Brislin (1970, 1973, 1980, 1986), Beaton et al. (2007), Guillemin
et al. (1993), Eremenco et al. (2005), and Herdman et
al. (1997). Face validity was assessed using a pilot sample,
content validity was evaluated by an expert committee as well
as through factor analysis, corrected item-total correlation, and Pearson correlation,
and construct validity was examined using both exploratory and confirmatory
factor analyses.
