The first activity, titled "Find Someone Who," was designed to
facilitate participant introductions and promote interpersonal interaction by encouraging participants
to ask questions and learn about one another. The primary
objective was to demonstrate that language use extends beyond the
mere retrieval of specific information; it also serves as a
tool for initiating conversations, establishing connections through nonverbal cues such
as eye contact and facial expressions, and selecting appropriate language
to foster familiarity and comfort among participants. To implement this
activity, facilitators assigned participants to three breakout rooms and provided
them with a table listing the job titles, cities, and
countries of the guests (see Figure 2). Using this information,
participants formulated and asked questions in an attempt to identify
the individuals present in their breakout room within the allotted
time for the activity.
