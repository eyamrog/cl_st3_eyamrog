Following the careful and detailed processes of translation, adaptation, semantic
equivalence assessment, and pilot testing, the Brazilian Portuguese version of
the SBS was back-translated into English by a professional whose
native language is English and who is fluent in Brazilian
Portuguese. The back-translation was conducted independently, without access to the
original questionnaire or subject-specific technical knowledge, in accordance with established
guidelines (Beaton et al., 2000; Beaton et al., 2002; Beaton
et al., 2007; Guillemin et al., 1993; Eremenco et al.,
2005). Subsequently, the original and back-translated versions were compared to
evaluate whether the translated version preserved both semantic and conceptual
equivalence, ensuring that the items retained their intended meaning. The
review of the back-translation is a critical step in cross-cultural
adaptation, particularly for confirming conceptual equivalence (Herdman et al., 1998).
This comparison, aimed at identifying any discrepancies, was conducted by
a committee of experts, who in this study were the
principal investigators. No discrepancies were identified between the original and
the translated versions. After this evaluation, the back-translated version was
submitted to the original authors of the questionnaire, who confirmed
the equivalence of the items and reaffirmed their authorization for
the use of the scale in Brazil.
