Among the five Bagrobdella species described from A. occidentalis, three
are found in the watershed of the Nilo-Sudanian province, while
the other two newly identified species are from the Tanganyika
province. This distribution suggests either that these monogenean species are
specific to their respective ichthyofaunal provinces, or that there may
be two distinct host species involved, given that the systematic
status of A. occidentalis remains under debate (see, for example,
Geerinckx & Vreven, 2013).
