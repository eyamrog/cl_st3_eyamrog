They establish constraints regarding what actions are relevant in the
subsequent turn (for example, a ‘question’ makes an ‘answer’ particularly
relevant in the next turn), but they do not, in
themselves, assign the next turn to a specific speaker. Nevertheless,
they constitute the fundamental element in the process of selecting
the next speaker, as it is primarily through affiliation with
a first pair-part that the most effective mechanism for selecting
the next speaker—namely, addressing a particular individual—operates (Sacks et al.,
1974, p. 717).
