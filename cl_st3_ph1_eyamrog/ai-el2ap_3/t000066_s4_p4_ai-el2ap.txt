Play also facilitated this connection by establishing a collaborative environment
in which participants could address immediate communication barriers and, more
significantly, engage with broader contexts to consider viable possibilities for
their existence. Through play, the process of overcoming obstacles is
maintained as a collective experience that enhances participantsâ€™ potential to
contribute to social justice. Play thus functions as a continuous,
reflexive, and practical exercise for navigating otherness, managing related conflicts,
and responding to the inherent drive for progress, all of
which are persistent and essential aspects of human development.
