Therefore, identifying sub-centralities enhances the understanding of microeconomic development issues
by linking firm cost structures—such as congestion, labor force accessibility,
and land prices—to workers’ welfare and productivity, including factors like
spatial segregation, commuting patterns, wages, and labor supply. Furthermore, the
implementation of subcenter-based development (SBD) as a public policy can
stimulate the creation of new business subcenters, reduce congestion by
decreasing the distance between firms and workers, promote a more
balanced spatial distribution of land prices, and inform the restructuring
of public transportation and taxation systems.
