Korinek (2011) was among the first theorists to provide a
formal framework for the prudential use of capital controls in
emerging economies. The model demonstrates that these economies tend to
accumulate excessive external debt as a result of capital inflows,
primarily because private agents fail to internalize the potential consequences
of future debt constraints arising from over-borrowing. During periods of
capital inflow, the model predicts increases in domestic consumption, asset
price inflation (with assets serving as collateral in financial transactions),
and currency appreciation. However, a negative shock to any of
these variables can trigger financial amplification, characterized by currency depreciation,
asset price deflation, and a contraction in aggregate demand. Under
such conditions, private agents may face a feedback loop that
results in either a partial cessation of external financing or
an increase in its associated costs.
