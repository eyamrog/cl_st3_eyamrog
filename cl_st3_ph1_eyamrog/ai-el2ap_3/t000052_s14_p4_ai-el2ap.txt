Measurements followed the methodology of Euzet and Le Brun (1990)
and were obtained using LAS version 4.12.0 software (Fig. 3).
Results are presented in micrometers (Âµm) as the mean, with
the range in parentheses and the number of individuals examined
indicated. Illustrations of the sclerotized structures of the Monogeneans were
produced in CorelDRAW 2019, based on photographs captured with a
digital camera. All statistical analyses were conducted using R version
4.1.2 (R Core Team, 2022).
