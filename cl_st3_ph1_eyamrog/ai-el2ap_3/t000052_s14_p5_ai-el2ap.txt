Data from 45 individuals of one new species, 10 individuals
of a second new species, and 10 individuals of Bagrobdella
parauchenoglanii were analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The analysis
was conducted with the FactoMineR (Husson et al. 2020) and
factoextra (Kassambara & Mundt 2020) packages in R. Additionally, Bagrobdella
auchenoglanii, B. fraudulenta, and B. anthopenis, each represented by the
mean values of the parameters reported by Euzet and Le
Brun (1990), were included in the analysis as supplementary individuals.
