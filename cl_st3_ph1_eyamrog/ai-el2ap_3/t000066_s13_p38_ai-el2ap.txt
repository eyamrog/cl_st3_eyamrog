Liberali (2020) argues that the construction of social change is
essential for effectively addressing and transforming the persistent and expanding
social inequalities observed in contemporary society. The workshop described in
this study was designed to facilitate participants' engagement in activities
guided by political and ethical considerations. Such engagement necessitates adopting
a critical perspective on personal values and aspirations. Self-development occurs
in tandem with societal change, with each influencing the other.
Therefore, fostering agency for social transformation is urgently required to
overcome the divisions perpetuated by everyday social realities.
