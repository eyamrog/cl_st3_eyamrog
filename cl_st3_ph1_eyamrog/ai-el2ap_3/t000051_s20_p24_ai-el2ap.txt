The fifth and final point made by Scholz is that
“Putin’s war” constitutes a “Zäsur” (‘caesura’) for German foreign policy,
thereby invoking the concept of a watershed moment. In contrast
to his previous statements, Scholz provides limited detail regarding the
specific direction of future foreign policy, aside from stating that
“wir werden uns Gesprächen mit Russland nicht verweigern” (‘we will
not refuse talks with Russia’), which suggests a passive stance
toward initiating dialogue. His assertion that “Alles andere halte ich
für unverantwortlich” (‘Anything else, I believe, would be irresponsible’) appears
to address those advocating for a complete diplomatic break with
Russia, while not considering perspectives that support actively seeking dialogue.
Scholz emphasizes the importance of avoiding “naivety,” which he defines
as “kein Reden um des Redens willen” (‘no talking for
the sake of talking’). Through a dialogically contractive concurrence, he
asserts that Putin has never demonstrated an interest in dialogue
(example 6), thereby attributing full responsibility for the lack of
communication to Putin and expressing a lack of confidence in
the efficacy of dialogue. Consequently, the proposed caesura in German
foreign policy appears to involve, as previously indicated, a sustained
conflict with Russia.
