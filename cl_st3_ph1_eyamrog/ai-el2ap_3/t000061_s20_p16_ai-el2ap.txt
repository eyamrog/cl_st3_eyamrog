The experience in the Undergraduate Scientific Research (USR) program has
been a significant factor in shaping my interest in pursuing
further research activities. Participation in a research group has contributed
substantially to my learning, and I have developed a greater
sense of autonomy and responsibility since becoming involved in this
environment (USResearcher 03, Questionnaire, 2021).
