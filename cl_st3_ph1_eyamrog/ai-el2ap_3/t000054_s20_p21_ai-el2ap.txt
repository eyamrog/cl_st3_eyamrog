Epibatidine was not developed as a therapeutic agent due to
its narrow margin between effective and toxic doses; however, it
served as a structural template for Abbott Laboratories, which synthesized
and patented the derivative ABT-594 in 1995. ABT-594 exhibits analgesic
potency approximately 200 times greater than that of morphine and
lacks the severe adverse effects associated with epibatidine (Angerer 2015).
