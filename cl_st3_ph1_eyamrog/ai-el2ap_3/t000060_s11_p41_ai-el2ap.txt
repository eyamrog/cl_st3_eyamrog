Deppermann (2011, p. 122) contends that same-speaker formulations, which involve
reworking a previous reference or description, serve functions such as
explicating, clarifying, specifying, or generalizing meanings, while other-speaker formulations primarily
function as displays of understanding and may also clarify or
explicate meanings. However, in both cases, formulations do not constitute
a transparent mechanism for rendering meanings clear. Rather, formulations possess
both explicative and transformative dimensions.
