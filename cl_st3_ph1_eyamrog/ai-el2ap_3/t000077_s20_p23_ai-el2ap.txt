The positive association between hourly earnings and the probability of
remote work persisted in column (4), indicating that, among otherwise
similar workers, higher income is correlated with a greater likelihood
of working from home. The most substantial effect observed in
the column (4) model was attributed to college education; specifically,
workers with a college degree exhibited an 11.78 percentage point
higher probability of engaging in remote work compared to those
with no education. This effect was reduced by nearly half
after controlling for labor activities, suggesting that the higher incidence
of remote work among more educated workers is partly explained
by occupational selection within the labor market. As noted by
Gaudecker et al. (2020), the significant role of education, even
after accounting for income, suggests that the feasibility of remote
work is primarily determined by the nature of job tasks
rather than the mere availability of resources for home-based work.
