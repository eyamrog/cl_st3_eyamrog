Subsequently, descriptive and Contrastive Interlanguage Analysis (CIA) research utilizing data
from CorIFA were presented to demonstrate the contributions the corpus
has made to research on learner interlanguage. The studies referenced
in this paper support the assertion that compiling and analyzing
a learner corpus constitutes a valuable resource for language teachers
seeking to improve their understanding of learner output, thereby facilitating
more informed and effective pedagogical decision-making.
