The species recorded in the seed bank overlap by 30%
(12 species) with those identified in the concurrent floristic survey
conducted in the same area. This level of similarity aligns
with the findings of Marcante et al. (2009), who report
substantial differences between the species composition of seed banks and
that of extant vegetation. Typically, vegetation exhibits greater species diversity
than the seed bank, as certain dispersed seeds are unable
to remain viable in the soil for extended periods in
a dormant state while awaiting favorable conditions for germination (Martins
et al. 2015).
