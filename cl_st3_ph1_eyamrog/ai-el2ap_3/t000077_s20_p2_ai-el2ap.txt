The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the adoption of various remote work
arrangements for a significant portion of the employed population in
Brazil, with the feasibility of continued employment under these conditions
largely determined by occupational characteristics. Given that the nature of
work tasks is a key factor influencing the potential for
remote work, the analysis of the results is based on
this classification. Figure 1 presents the proportion of workers who
engaged in remote work, disaggregated by categories of work type,
position, or function.
