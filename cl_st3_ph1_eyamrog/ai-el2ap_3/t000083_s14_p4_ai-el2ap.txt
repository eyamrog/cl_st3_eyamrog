In the first stage, the original version of the questionnaire
was translated into Brazilian Portuguese by the authors of this
study, who are fluent in English. The translation process involved
a comprehensive analysis of each questionnaire item, with direct comparison
to the original English version. This analysis extended beyond literal
word-for-word translation to consider more nuanced factors, such as the
potential impact of specific terms within the cultural context of
the target population. Such comparative analysis between the translated and
original versions is essential, as literal equivalence does not necessarily
result in equivalent interpretations across different cultures (Giusti & Befi-Lopes,
2008). This approach recognizes that cultural factors significantly influence the
interpretation of variables, thereby requiring cross-cultural adaptation to ensure that
the original intent of the scale is maintained in the
adapted language (Herdman et al., 1998).
