Identification. This species is distinguished by its large basidiomata, which
can reach up to 8 cm in diameter, involute lacinias,
and non-hygroscopic nature. It possesses a prominent and conspicuous collar
around the endoperidium, derived from the pseudoparenchymal layer of the
exoperidium. The endoperidium is sessile, and the peristoma is either
delimited or unbounded and fibrous (Sunhede 1989).
