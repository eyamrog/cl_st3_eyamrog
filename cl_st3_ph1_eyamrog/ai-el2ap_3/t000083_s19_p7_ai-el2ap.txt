Table 3 displays the corrected item-total correlation coefficients and the
internal consistency of the SBS, as assessed by Cronbach's Alpha
(α) and McDonald's Omega (ω), including their respective values if
individual items were deleted. Both alpha and omega coefficients demonstrated
satisfactory levels of internal consistency, ranging from 0.60 to 0.89,
consistent with established benchmarks (Toledo Junior et al., 2018; Bowling,
2005; Tavakol & Dennick, 2011), across both the overall scale
and its individual factors. In several cases, omega values were
marginally higher than alpha values for certain factors and items.
The overall reliability of the scale was α = .80
and ω = .81, while the reliability coefficients for each
of the five factors exceeded 0.78 for both α and
ω. For some items, the deletion resulted in decreased α
and ω coefficients, indicating that these items contributed positively to
the reliability of the scale. The "Corrected Item-Total Correlation" column
reports the correlation between each item and the total scale
score; values above 0.3 are generally considered acceptable for reliability
purposes. In this study, all items demonstrated corrected item-total correlations
above 0.52, supporting the reliability of the scale (Hair et
al., 2009).
