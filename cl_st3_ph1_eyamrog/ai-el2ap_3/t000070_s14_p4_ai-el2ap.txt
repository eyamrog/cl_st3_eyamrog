The germination test was performed in vitro by placing seeds
in 60 x 15 mm Petri dishes containing sterilized filter
paper moistened with 2.0 mL of Murashige and Skoog (MS)
liquid culture medium (Murashige & Skoog, 1962), supplemented with Morel
vitamins (Morel & Wetmore, 1951) and 30 g L⁻¹ sucrose.
The pH of the medium was adjusted to 5.8 prior
to sterilization, which was carried out in an autoclave at
121 °C and 1.3 atm for 20 minutes. The cultures
were incubated in a BOD chamber at 25 ± 2
°C under a 16-hour photoperiod with a light intensity of
55 ± μmol m⁻² s⁻¹.
