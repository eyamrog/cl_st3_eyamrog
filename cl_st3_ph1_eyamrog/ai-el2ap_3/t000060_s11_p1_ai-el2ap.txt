A central concept in conversation analysis is the sequential unit
known as the adjacency pair. This concept posits that conversational
turns are organized in pairs, with the initial turn, or
first pair-part, establishing expectations that constrain the range of appropriate
responses in the subsequent turn. As described by Sacks et
al. (1974, p. 716), adjacency pairs encompass sequences such as
"greeting-greeting" and "invitation-acceptance/decline," among others. The initial utterance in such
a sequence is referred to as the "first pair-part," which
functions to project and delimit the possible forms of the
second pair-part in the interaction.
