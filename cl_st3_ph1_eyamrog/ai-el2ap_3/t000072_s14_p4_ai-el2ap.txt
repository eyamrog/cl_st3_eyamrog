For seed bank sampling, five plots measuring 10 × 10
meters were established 5 meters from the Mogi Guaçu River
(designated as R plots), with a minimum distance of 30
meters between each plot. Additionally, five plots of the same
size were established approximately 30 meters from the river (designated
as I plots). Both R and I plots were numbered
from one to five. The R1 and I1 plots were
specifically positioned 250 meters downstream from the Water Treatment Station
to minimize its potential influence on the sampled areas. The
distances from the fragment entrance to the beginning of each
plot, as well as the geographical coordinates of each plot
(see Figure 3), were determined using a GARMIN Mark 20x
Global Positioning System (GPS) device.
