Theridiidae exhibited the highest species richness, with five species recorded,
followed by Corinnidae and Linyphiidae, each represented by three species.
Among the 20 species identified, only two were notably more
abundant: Ianduba varia (Keyserling, 1891), with six individuals (17.14% of
the total adults), and Agyneta sp., with five individuals (14.28%).
The remaining species were represented by one or two individuals
each (Table 1).
