In addition, the sample size satisfies the recommended minimum of
200 participants for advanced statistical analyses, such as confirmatory factor
analysis (Watkins, 1989). The Structural Equation Model used in the
factor analysis demonstrated an excellent fit, as indicated by the
following indices: CFI = 0.93, TLI = 0.96, RMSEA =
0.041, GIF = 0.92, AGIF = 0.89, and NNFI =
0.92. The reliability of the factors, as measured by Cronbach's
α and McDonald's ω, as well as the overall reliability
of the scale, were satisfactory, with coefficients exceeding 0.80 for
α and 0.81 for ω, respectively (Bentler, 1995).
