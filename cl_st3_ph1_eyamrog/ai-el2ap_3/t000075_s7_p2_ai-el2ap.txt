On the other hand, it is widely recognized that mainstream
economics did not adopt this interpretation during the 1970s and
1980s, a period in which the purported benefits of free
capital mobility were emphasized. However, the mainstream perspective on financial
openness and capital controls has changed significantly over the past
two and a half decades for several reasons. The orthodox
assumptions that underpinned financial liberalization in the 1980s and 1990s
were challenged by the financial crises that affected emerging economies
in the late 1990s. Furthermore, the global financial crisis of
2008 marked another significant turning point in mainstream research, which
was further influenced by the adoption of capital controls by
several emerging economies in the post-crisis period. In this context,
recent mainstream literature is characterized by: (i) new recommendations regarding
regulatory measures on capital flows; (ii) empirical studies assessing the
effectiveness of capital controls and macroprudential policies; and (iii) the
development of new orthodox models that justify the use of
capital controls. Unlike two decades ago, when mainstream economics generally
advocated for unrestricted capital movement, recent empirical studies and theoretical
models indicate that countries—particularly emerging economies—may employ capital controls to
promote financial stability, maintain monetary policy autonomy, and potentially achieve
higher rates of economic growth.
