The formative potential of University Social Responsibility (USR) is primarily
based on its capacity to facilitate learning through imitation, a
process widely acknowledged by the authors central to this study.
Adorno (1993: 147), in Minima Moralia, asserts that “the human
clings to imitation: a human being becomes truly human only
when he imitates other human beings.” This perspective is critical
for conceptualizing USR as a significant context for the moral
development of researchers, as Adorno (2009) argues that human formation
occurs through mimetic identification with individuals who embody universal human
qualities.
