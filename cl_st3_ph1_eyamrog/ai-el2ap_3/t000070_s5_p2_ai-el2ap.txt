In this context, the water content of plant material used
in cryopreservation protocols is a critical parameter to monitor, as
it can significantly influence the effectiveness of strategies designed to
prevent damage caused by intracellular water crystallization (Vendrame et al.
2014). In the present study, this factor was not specifically
assessed; however, ultrastructural analyses indicated no evidence of lysis or
damage to membranes and cell walls. According to González-Arnao and
Engelmann (2013), a reduced water content in plant material can
induce a phase change during immersion in liquid nitrogen, known
as the “vitrification” phase. This phase transition prevents the formation
of ice structures by inhibiting the aggregation of water molecules,
thereby preserving the physical properties of the material in an
amorphous solid state (Kulus & Zalewska 2014).
