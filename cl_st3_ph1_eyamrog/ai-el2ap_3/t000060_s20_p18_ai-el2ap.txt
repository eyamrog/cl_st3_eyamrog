From a pragmatic perspective, questions that conclude with the discourse
markers "correct" and "right" can be considered functionally equivalent to
tag questions, as they serve a similar illocutionary purpose. This
is exemplified in Excerpts 1 and 2, where Mr. Martinez
states, “So... after two o’CLOCK... that... you... took everything and
put it down in the car correct?” and “it was
at two specifically it was around two o’clock when you
actually put the luggage in the car right?”. Drawing on
Gibbons (2003, p. 95), Holt and Johnson (2010, p. 25)
identify two primary objectives of questions in legal contexts: (1)
eliciting information and (2) obtaining confirmation of a version of
events that the questioner has in mind. The examples analyzed
here appear to function primarily as devices aimed at achieving
the latter objective.
