Adorno and Horkheimer (1985) identify education as a central factor
in understanding modern society, emphasizing its role in facilitating processes
of clarification, particularly within formal educational institutions. According to the
authors, adopting a critical perspective, "a pedagogy that makes children
unaccustomed to being infantile â€“ is the very condition of
civilization" (Adorno and Horkheimer, 1985: 85). They argue that the
modern educational process does not utilize mimesis as a foundation
for the development of rationality; rather, it begins by repressing
mimetic behavior in order to regulate childish impulses.
