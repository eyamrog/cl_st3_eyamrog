Firms encounter a tradeoff when choosing to locate in suburban
business districts (SBD) rather than central business districts (CBD). Firms
situated in the CBD benefit from agglomeration economies, which can
enhance productivity and efficiency. In contrast, firms considering relocation to
the suburbs may face several disadvantages, including increased commuting difficulties
and a smaller available labor pool, which can act as
deterrents to suburbanization (McMillen, 2001b).
