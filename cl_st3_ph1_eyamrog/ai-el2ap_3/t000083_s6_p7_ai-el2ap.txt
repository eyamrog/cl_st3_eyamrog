Self-esteem is a psychological construct through which individuals may attempt
to improve their mood by enhancing self-confidence, which can increase
the likelihood of taking and posting selfies. Evidence suggests that
selfie sharing is associated with higher self-confidence, particularly in contexts
where individuals carefully select selfies or anticipate positive feedback (Chang
et al., 2019). Although selfie posting may be linked to
improved self-esteem and confidence, its effects in the short to
medium term appear to be variable and are influenced by
the nature of the feedback received (Rosenthal-von der Puetten et
al., 2019). Further research is required to clarify the role
of mood modification in selfitis, including both the positive and
negative consequences of selfie-related behaviors. The present study found that
individuals in the early (mild) stages of selfitis scored higher
on the "mood and confidence" factor, indicating greater susceptibility to
mood enhancement and increased confidence following selfie posting. Additionally, participants
with moderate levels of selfitis scored higher on the "subjective
conformity" factor, which reflects the need for group belonging. This
need, when excessive, may lead individuals to engage in behaviors
aimed at gaining acceptance within online groups or obtaining "likes"
(McLean et al., 2019; Rosenthal-von der Puetten et al., 2019).
Chua and Chang (2016) reported that among girls in Singapore,
the need for online group acceptance was associated with self-esteem
and the pursuit of positive feedback. Consistent with these findings,
the present study observed that individuals with moderate selfitis exhibited
a greater need for acceptance compared to other groups. Furthermore,
the "subjective conformity" factor demonstrated strong correlations with the "social
competition," "attention seeking," and "mood and confidence" factors, suggesting that
a higher need for acceptance is associated with increased competitive
behaviors (e.g., taking selfies in various poses or posting selfies
to receive more "likes"), greater attention-seeking through efforts to enhance
online popularity, and elevated confidence when taking and posting selfies.
