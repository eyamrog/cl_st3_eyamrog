Identification. This species can be readily distinguished by the presence
of a persistent membranous exoperidium in mature specimens, an endoperidium
exhibiting a velvety texture with numerous mycosclereids that are clearly
visible under a stereomicroscope, a mamiform and fimbriated mouth, and
globose basidiospores characterized by ridges that display a distinctive cross-linked
to sub-crosslinked morphology (Campi et al. 2016a).
