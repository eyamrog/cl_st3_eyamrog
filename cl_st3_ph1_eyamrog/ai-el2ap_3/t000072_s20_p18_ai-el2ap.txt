According to information provided by the administration of the Guarnição
da Aeronáutica de Pirassununga, certain areas adjacent to the Mogi
Guaçu River within the Pirassununga Municipality require ecological restoration (S.M.
Barroso, personal communication). In this context, the species identified in
the present study were compared with the List of Species
Specified for Ecological Restoration for Various Regions of the State
of São Paulo (Barbosa 2017), and 18 of the recorded
species are recommended for restoration purposes. These findings suggest that
the studied fragment has potential to serve as a source
of propagules for the rehabilitation of degraded areas, either through
the selection of seed trees for seed collection and subsequent
seedling production, or through the translocation of soil and/or litter
(Brancalion et al. 2015).
