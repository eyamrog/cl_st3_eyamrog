Moraceae was the second most diverse family in terms of
species richness, represented by five morphospecies and ten individuals: four
of Ficus hirsuta Schott, three of Ficus guaranitica Chodat, and
one of Ficus eximia Schott. Two individuals could not be
identified to species level and were designated as Ficus sp.
1 and Ficus sp. 2. Based on the work of
Mendonça-Souza (2006), these unidentified individuals were tentatively considered to be
Ficus adhatodifolia Schott in Spreng. and Ficus obtusiuscula (Miq.) Miq.;
however, due to overlapping vegetative characteristics between these species, additional
information regarding the pseudofruit is required for accurate identification. The
seedlings collected in this study were in the vegetative stage,
and therefore species-level identification was not attempted. The genus Ficus
is the most species-rich within the Moraceae family, comprising approximately
800 species distributed primarily in tropical and subtropical regions, with
limited occurrence in temperate zones (Pelissari & Romaniuc-Neto 2013). Species
of this genus play a significant role in forest ecosystems,
as their pseudofruits (syconia) serve as a food source for
a wide range of animals, including mammals, birds, and fish,
thereby facilitating extensive seed dispersal (Mendonça-Souza 2006). Pollination in Ficus
is mediated by wasps through a highly specialized mutualistic relationship
(Pelissari & Romaniuc-Neto 2013).
