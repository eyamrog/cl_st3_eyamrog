According to Benjamin (as cited in Buck-Morss, 1995, p. 290),
the decline of mimetic ability in adulthood is attributed to
the loss of the capacity to perceive non-sensory similarities, which
are defined as those lacking a rational, specifically scientific, basis.
Benjamin (as cited in Lavelle, 2014, p. 82) discusses certain
mimetic practices characteristic of children's play, suggesting that these practices
once formed the foundation of a magical worldview. He establishes
a parallel between the historical devaluation of mimetic behavior—marked by
its replacement with the inductive reasoning central to modern science—and
its decline within the individual, particularly evident in the diminished
imaginative capacity observed as children mature. Within this framework, Benjamin
identifies the school as a primary agent in suppressing the
mimetic impulse in children (Schlesener, 2019).
