In comparison with the study by Neto et al. (2020),
the dominant species identified were largely similar, as the seed
bank of a mature semideciduous forest examined by these authors
was primarily composed of T. micrantha (L.) Blume, Cecropia hololeuca
Miq., and Solanum sp. These species are recognized for their
ability to persist in the soil for extended periods and
typically require high light availability for germination (Martins 2016). They
play a significant role in forest regeneration due to their
pioneer characteristics, often germinating in canopy gaps and at forest
edges (Pereira et al. 2010; Correia & Martins 2015), and
are predominantly dispersed by animals, particularly birds (Ruschel et al.
2008).
