While the lack of transparency and clarity regarding the extent
to which journals adhere to scholarly standards is a widespread
issue in scholarly publishing, the implementation of verification and communication
systems can contribute to reducing the misclassification of journals as
“predatory.” Making journal adherence to scholarly standards explicit and publicly
accessible may promote broader utilization of this information. Journalists and
other professionals may increasingly consult these labels before referencing research,
and incorporating the interpretation of such labels into science education
could enhance students’ understanding of research quality. Establishing an industry
standard for scholarly publishing aligns with the goals of universal
open access and increased public support for research.
