Although previous research suggests that selfie behavior may develop into
an addictive pattern (Kaur and Vig, 2016; Kela et al.,
2017; Shah, 2015; Singh and Lippmann, 2017; Griffiths and Balakrishnan,
2018), the specific positive or negative impacts of this behavior
remain insufficiently explored. While several instruments and studies have been
developed in Brazil to assess problematic internet use and its
effects on individuals, there is, to the best of our
knowledge, no Brazilian research specifically addressing selfie-taking behavior. This gap
in the literature may be attributed to the lack of
a validated instrument for assessing selfie behavior in the Brazilian
context.
