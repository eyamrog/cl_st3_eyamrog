Analysis of selfie behavior levels (low, mild, moderate, and severe)
indicated that individuals with low levels of selfie engagement scored
higher on the "environmental enhancement" factor. This factor reflects the
tendency of individuals to use selfies as a means of
connecting with their environment and creating emotional memories, often associating
the act of taking selfies with specific settings or social
contexts, such as being with friends or visiting locations like
bars and restaurants, in order to document the experience (Boursier
& Manna, 2018; Kiprin, 2013).
