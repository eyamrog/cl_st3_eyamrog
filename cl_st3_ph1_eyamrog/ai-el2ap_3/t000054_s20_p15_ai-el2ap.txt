Peyote is a cactus species indigenous to the arid regions
of Mexico and the southern United States. The term "peyote"
encompasses two species: Lophophora williamsii and Lophophora diffusa. Lophophora williamsii
primarily produces the alkaloid mescaline, while Lophophora diffusa predominantly synthesizes
pellotine. Both mescaline and pellotine are psychoactive alkaloids, exhibiting psychotropic
effects that are comparable to those of lysergic acid.
