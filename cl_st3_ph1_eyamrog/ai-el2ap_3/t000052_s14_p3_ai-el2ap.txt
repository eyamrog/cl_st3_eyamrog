The gills were examined using a Wild Heerbrugg® M8 binocular
microscope. Monogeneans were recovered with an entomologist needle, and selected
individuals were mounted in a drop of Hoyer’s medium (Anderson
1954) on a slide and covered with a coverslip to
flatten the specimens. The slides were allowed to dry in
a horizontal position for 24 hours before the coverslips were
sealed with Glyceel (Bates 1997). Additional specimens were mounted in
tap water and identified using a Leica® DM 2500 microscope
equipped with a Leica DMC 4500 digital camera. Following identification,
monogeneans were individually stored in Eppendorf® tubes containing 96% ethanol
for subsequent genetic analyses.
