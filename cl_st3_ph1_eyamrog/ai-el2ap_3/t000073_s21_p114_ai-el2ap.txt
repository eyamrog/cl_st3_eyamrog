Identification. This species is distinguished by its obovoid, perforate receptacle,
which ranges in color from white to yellowish and exhibits
isodiametric meshes. The receptacle arms are joined at the base,
and a prominent yellow basal mycelium is present. Additionally, the
gleba is restricted to glebifers located on the inner side
of the intersections of the arms (Dring et al. 1971;
Dring 1980).
