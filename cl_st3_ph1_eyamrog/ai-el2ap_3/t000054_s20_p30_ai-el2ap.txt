The growing demand for food to support both the human
population and captive-bred animal species has prompted the exploration of
alternative nutrient sources. One such alternative is the use of
insect-derived flours. The larvae of the black soldier fly (Hermetia
illucens L.), originally native to America and now distributed globally,
can be processed into a protein-rich flour that has demonstrated
utility in the diets of fish (Meitiyani et al. 2020)
and birds (Wahid et al. 2021).
