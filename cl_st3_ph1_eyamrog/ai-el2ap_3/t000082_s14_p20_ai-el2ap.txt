In our model, coevolutionary dynamics may lead to a reduction
in the total number of interactions, thereby promoting specialization. To
assess whether the removal of interactions through coevolutionary dynamics differs
from random removal, we generated, for each simulation, a third
network by randomly removing F interactions from the initial network,
where F corresponds to the number of interactions lost in
the coevolved network. This approach ensured that the randomly altered
network contained the same number of interactions as the coevolved
network, although the specific interactions removed were selected at random.
We then compared changes in network structure resulting from random
loss of interactions to those resulting from the loss of
interactions due to trait dissimilarity as determined by coevolutionary outcomes.
