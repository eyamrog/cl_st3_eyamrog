In response to the challenges posed by the pandemic, the
GPB community actively promotes global collaboration in various forms. The
workshops, including the one examined in this study, aim to
engage participants in processes of social transformation by fostering affectus
(Spinoza, 2017) through interactive play and discussion sessions. These workshops
encourage the development of new perspectives and realities through dialogue
and a range of creative practices, such as imagination, improvisation,
and performance. This initiative seeks to counteract forces that hinder
the possibility of coexistence, which is understood as the integration
of diverse elements that constitute individual and collective identity.
