Another characteristic relevant to the corpus design is its suitability
for longitudinal studies, as the data can facilitate analysis of
the relationship between students’ writing development and proficiency level over
time. There is a limited number of learner corpus studies
that adopt a longitudinal approach (with the exceptions of Biber
et al., 2020; Goutéraux, 2013; Littré, 2015; Meunier & Littré,
2013). Up to 2019, 217 students submitted texts across more
than one semester; of these, 197 students submitted texts over
a one-year period (two semesters), while 20 students contributed over
a period exceeding one year (three semesters or more). Additionally,
CorIFA data may include contributions from students who began IFA
classes as undergraduates and continued to participate after enrolling in
a graduate program.
