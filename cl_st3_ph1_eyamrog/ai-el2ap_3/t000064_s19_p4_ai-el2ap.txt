Leaf transpiration rates were maintained at constant levels during the
measurement of light response curves; however, these rates differed among
the experimental groups. Wild plants exhibited the highest transpiration rates,
followed by in vitro plants. Greenhouse-grown and garden-grown plants demonstrated
similar transpiration rates, both of which were lower than those
observed in wild plants. Consequently, instantaneous water use efficiency was
greater in the young, garden-grown plants compared to the adult
wild plants (Table 1).
