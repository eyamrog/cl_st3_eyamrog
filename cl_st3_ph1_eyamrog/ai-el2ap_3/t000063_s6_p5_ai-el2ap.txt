Future research should examine the duration and long-term effects of
the COVID-19 pandemic on scientific and healthcare careers to accurately
assess the impact of the "Fauci effect." Recent studies have
begun to explore the pandemic's influence on perceptions of science,
scientists, and healthcare professionals, as well as its effects on
professional trajectories in various global contexts. Comparing the findings of
this study with those from other regions, where adolescents were
exposed to different public health policies, pandemic communications, and COVID-19
outcomes, would provide valuable insights into the broader implications of
the pandemic on career interests and perceptions.
