In addition to identifying the subcenters, this study characterized the
predominant activities within each SBD and analyzed the distribution of
wages and educational attainment among SBD workers. SBDs with a
higher proportion of low-wage employees also exhibited a greater concentration
of workers with lower educational levels, primarily engaged in retail
trade activities. In contrast, SBDs with a focus on financial
activities demonstrated higher average wages and a greater proportion of
workers with higher educational attainment. These findings indicate that the
identified sites function as centralities within the MSP and display
considerable heterogeneity.
