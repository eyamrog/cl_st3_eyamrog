Brazil faces the challenge of compensating for historical delays in
pharmaceutical development, a situation that extends to the broader Latin
American region (Valli, Russo, & Bolzani, 2018). The subcontinent is
at a disadvantage in this sector; between 1981 and 2014,
1,211 new pharmaceutical products were introduced globally, with 60% derived
from natural substances or inspired by natural structures (Newman &
Cragg, 2016).
