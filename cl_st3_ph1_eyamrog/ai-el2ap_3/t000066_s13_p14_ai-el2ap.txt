As a result, facilitators structured the sequence of activities, including
the opening and closing songs, and ensured that play and
discussion were aligned with the topic of global collaboration. This
approach enabled the young professionals participating as guests in the
workshop to connect the content to their own experiences and
encouraged engagement with others both during and after the workshop,
with the aim of fostering creative approaches to enhancing their
agency. The intention was to create an environment in which
the group could develop their conatus, as defined by Spinoza
(2003, III, Prop. VII), referring to the potential to improve
and sustain oneâ€™s existence.
