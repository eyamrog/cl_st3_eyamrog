Two of the largest learner corpora compiled in the 1990s,
the International Corpus of Learner English (ICLE) and the Longman
Learnersâ€™ Corpus (LLC), are notable for their approaches to language-,
task-, and learner-related features (Granger, 1998; Tono, 2003). In terms
of language-related features, both corpora consist of written texts, but
differ slightly in other aspects: ICLE primarily contains argumentative essays
on a predetermined set of topics, while LLC includes both
essays and exam scripts on a wider range of topics.
Task-related characteristics include (a) data collection, which is sectional rather
than longitudinal; (b) type of elicitation, with a preference for
spontaneous over prepared or edited texts; (c) production time, which
may be fixed, timed, untimed, or completed as homework; and
(d) the use of reference materials, such as dictionaries, with
such usage systematically recorded. Regarding learner-related features, ICLE comprises texts
produced by university-level students, whereas LLC includes contributions from learners
at various academic levels. Both corpora contain texts written by
learners from diverse first language backgrounds. ICLE focuses on high-intermediate
to advanced proficiency levels, while LLC accepts texts from all
proficiency levels. ICLE was the first large-scale computerized learner corpus
made available for research, whereas LLC has been commercially available
for research purposes (Tono, 2003, p. 800). The most recent
version of ICLE contains over 5.5 million words (Granger et
al., 2020), while LLC comprises 10 million words (Tono, 2003),
although more recent updates for LLC are not available on
its website.
