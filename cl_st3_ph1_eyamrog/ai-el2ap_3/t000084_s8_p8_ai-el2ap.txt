Garrison et al. (1999) define cognitive presence as a crucial
component of critical thinking, which is often regarded as a
primary objective of higher education (p. 93). Cognitive presence can
be observed in asynchronous written communication when students exchange information,
connect ideas, and apply new concepts. Within the Community of
Inquiry (CoI) framework, Garrison et al. identify cognitive presence as
one of its core elements, developed through participantsâ€™ interactions and
the collaborative construction of meaning via sustained communication.
