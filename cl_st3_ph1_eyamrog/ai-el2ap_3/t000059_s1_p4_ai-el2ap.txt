Conclusions: The inclusion criteria employed by LILACS effectively mitigate potential
pro-endogeneity effects that university ownership may exert on regional journals.
When evaluating journals, it is important to consider journal size
in the analysis of authorship concentration indexes. A formal derivation
of the relationship between these indexes and journal size would
enable a more precise interpretation of authorship concentration metrics.
