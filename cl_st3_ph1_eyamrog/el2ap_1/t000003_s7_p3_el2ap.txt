Our research revealed the situated and multifaceted ways in which
these Timorese migrants were constructing identities within this particular life
world, along with the agentive ways in which they drew
on different linguistic, cultural and semiotic resources, in doing so.
It demonstrated the need to rethink the design and scope
of contemporary research into language, migration and deterritorialization. While we
need to document the specific ways in which linguistic repertoires
and language practices are shaped by language policies and educational
experiences in countries of origin, attention also need to be
given to the social processes associated with reterritorialization, and what
Hannam et al. (2006) referred to as mooring and to
the communicative practices that unfold during specific, situated processes of
mooring. It is only by adopting a dual focus on
migration and mooring that we can build a full picture
of the ways in which multilingual resources are reconfigured in
the context of transnational migration and the ways in which
identities are constructed in different domains of social life.
