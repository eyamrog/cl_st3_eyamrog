Bromeliaceae genera have different life habits in nature, such as
epiphytes, rupicolous, saxicolous, terricolous and facultatives that can live both
on the ground and on trees (Fischer & Araújo 1995)
and have been considered a highly important functional group of
tropical forests (Barrancos et al. 2016). This ability to potentially
adapt to different conditions is a requirement for survival after
removal from the area of origin. In the relocation as
epiphytes, bromeliad specimens are generally fixed onto tree pitchforks using
cotton strings (Jasper et al. 2005). However, over time, specimens
might experience inclination in relation to the trunk axis, which
may cause decreased survival because it might damage the water
storage in the cistern of bromeliads, which can lead to
water stress, and cause the plants’ fall to the soil
(Freitas et al. 1998). Therefore, the direct relocation on the
ground in the upright position could guarantee greater rosette stability,
especially in large bromeliads. The stabilised rosette would also favour
accumulating rainwater and nutrients between the leaves, which would be
absorbed by the plant or used by the associated fauna
(Benzing 2000).
