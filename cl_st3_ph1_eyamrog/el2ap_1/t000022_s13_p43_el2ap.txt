In effect, collaboration is one of the fundamental factors in
the remarkable growth of Brazilian authors' publications in recent decades.
In this regard, Sidone, Haddad, & Mena- Chalco (2016) showed
the central role of institutions in the Southeastern states in
intra- and inter-regional collaborations within Brazil. Although such states continue
to have this central role - particularly SÃ£o Paulo -
in recent years collaboration between other states in the same
or different regions has increased, a phenomenon that is particularly
strong in the Northeast and the South.
