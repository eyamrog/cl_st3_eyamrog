The need to formulate dialectical thinking at all stages of
education is a necessity. [...] Theoretical thinking does not arise
or develop in people's daily lives; it develops only in
response to instruction, where programs are based on the dialectical
understanding of thought. It is precisely this teaching that has
a developmental character. (Davydov, 1999, p. 5; 7).
