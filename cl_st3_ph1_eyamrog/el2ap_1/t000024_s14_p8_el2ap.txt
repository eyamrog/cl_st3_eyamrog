The specimens of W. cyathiformis, which also consisted of 60
plants, were all relocated with 100% of them in the
vegetative stage, with no plants with evidence of floral scape.
Statistical analyses - A generalized mixed linear modeling (GLMM) approach
was used to analyze the leaves and sprouts of Aechmea
distichantha and the means were compared by the Bonferroni test.
Also, the data of the variables number of leaves and
sprouts of the specie Wittrockia cyathiformis were analysed by the
Shapiro-Wilk test to verify the assumptions of normality. Thus, the
data were submitted to the Friedman test, whose medians were
compared using the Parwise Comparisons test (Durbin-Conover). Data were analyzed
using JAMOVI software (The Jamovi Project 2022). The survival of
the two species of bromeliads was analyzed using the SISVAR
program (Ferreira 2011), whose experimental design was split-plot in time,
distributed in three blocks, with the main treatment being the
relocation form.
