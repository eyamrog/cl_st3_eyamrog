For example, Extract 1 shows an example of dialogic talk
that did emerge in these groups: a episode carefully selected
to illustrate how students interacted in high levels of dialogicity.
The identification of such episode among the others was only
possible after the systematic codification and frequency counting of the
entire dataset. Quantitatively, more than half of the utterances was
considered dialogic (17 out of 30; around 57%). For a
brief comparison, the average of the dialogicity across the seven
tasks was something around 33% (Figure 3).
