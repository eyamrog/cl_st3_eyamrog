Finally, to fill the gap caused by inadequate training, non-beginner
teachers emphasized the importance of career time in expanding the
emotional and pedagogical repertoire. In contrast, beginners tended to rely
on social support, which was not widely shared because many
do not perceive the support of colleagues and superiors. These
findings reinforce Sutton's (2004) assumption that teachers mainly learn to
regulate negative emotions through their classroom practice.
