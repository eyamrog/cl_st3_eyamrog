Consistent with previous findings, situation modification was mainly used to
deal with inappropriate behavior (CHANG; DAVES, 2009; SUTTON, 2004; TAXER
& GROSS, 2018), demotivation, and learning difficulties (AKBARI et al.,
2018; SUTTON, 2004; YIN, 2016). It seems that, in anticipating
unpleasant circumstances, teachers avoid or decrease negative emotions in self
(self-regulation) and students (hetero-regulation) (BURIÄ† et al., 2016; TAXER; GROSS,
2018), thus avoiding unnecessary conflicts and interruptions ( SUTTON, 2004).
