For didactic purposes, the next sections are divided into quantitative
or qualitative methods. For each of them, there is a
brief presentation of one analytical procedure and its application to
real classroom discursive data from a previous project. The research
questions and findings are presented here just as an exemplary
model of operationalising paradigms and methods. Thus, the goal is
not to discuss the new knowledge on dialogic teaching generated
from this data.
