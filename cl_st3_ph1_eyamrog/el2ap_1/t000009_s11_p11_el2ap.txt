Hyland (2007) explains that early studies focused on lexical and
syntactic features of particular registers. Later, interest moved to the
rhetorical macro-structure of specialist texts. Now a deeper interest in
specific discourse communities leads to a pursuit of the understanding
of community-situated language use and describing specific target texts required
by learners. This investigation typically involves either experienced members of
the community, the genres produced and consumed by them, or
both.
