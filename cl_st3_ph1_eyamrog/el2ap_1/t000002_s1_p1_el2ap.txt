This article presents a theoretical work whose objective is the
discussion of methodologies and methods in educational research, in particular
those that analyze classroom discursive interactions. The first part discusses
the two main research paradigms and their ontological and epistemological
bases: positivism and interpretivism. Next, two methods for analyzing discursive
interactions are presented and discussed, one for each paradigm. Systematic
coding - within the quantitative context - is indicated to
treat data from large samples, to describe general patterns and,
by transforming the discourse into variables, to statistical comparisons or
temporal analyses. The method is applied in a set of
42 episodes of group dialogue and the results are discussed
in light of the nature of the research questions, showing
what types of statistical tests can be performed. Within the
interpretivist paradigm, sociocultural discourse analysis is presented as an example
of qualitative method an it is applied to excerpts from
classroom dialogues. The main finding is the identification of typologies
that describe the ways in which teacher and students construct
scientific explanations. In the final part, some possibilities and limits
of each method are discussed and the conclusion defendes that
both can be seen as complementary for the advancement of
knowledge in the educational field.
