Of course, ethical considerations are relevant to all these initiatives
– and not only to the process of enabling and
maintaining access to documentary materials, but also in considering how
and whether community members wish to limit their access and
use (see the sections above; also MACRI and SARMENTO, 2010;
DEBENPORT, 2010). Some recorded material may be viewed as potentially
damaging, dangerous, offensive, or otherwise private, and understandings of who
should or should not have access to what material may
involve complex and intersecting categories, associated with particular conceptions of
outsider/insider, gender, clan, neighbor, relative, etc. – which may be
much more complex than the blanket term ‘community’ implies. As
pointed out above, decisions about access, like other facets of
documentation and archiving, must be continually informed by ethical principles.
