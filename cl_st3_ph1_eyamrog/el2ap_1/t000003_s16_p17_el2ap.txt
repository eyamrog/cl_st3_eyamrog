The Timorese arriving in Dungannon, or other local towns, eventually
find work in one of the factories in the region.
The largest one – Moy Park – is based in
Dungannon. It specialises in chicken processing and packaging (e.g. for
sale in supermarkets). This was formerly an Irish company, but
when we were doing fieldwork in 2015, we learned that
it had been owned by a Brazilian corporation since 2010.
This development highlights the increasingly globalized nature of this aspect
of food production. Two smaller factories in Cookstown specialise in
the packaging of pork and of cheese for the retail
sector (Interview with DA, in Tetum, June 2015). There is
also a rendering plant in the area that prepares animal
feed (Joint interview with RS and HA, June 2015).
