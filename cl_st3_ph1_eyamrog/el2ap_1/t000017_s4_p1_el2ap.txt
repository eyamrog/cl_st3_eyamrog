The B-PREA-R is a quick and easy test to apply
in the educational context and presents adequate psychometric properties to
evaluate cognitive development in the preschool stage, discover the child's
potentialities and weaknesses and guide his cognitive preparation to start
basic schooling. The update of the battery improved validity and
reliability in terms of item performance (96% of items with
high and good quality, while only 4% with fair quality),
as well as the quantity and quality of subtests to
characterize the child and assess his or her initial preparation
for the beginning of the next school stage. The characteristics
of the B-PREA-R allow educators to apply it in the
educational context, either in the partial or final evaluative cut,
therefore, it is an alternative to perform the evaluation of
the preschool child according to the requirements of resolution 238/2014,
regulations for the application of the school evaluation system in
Cuba.
