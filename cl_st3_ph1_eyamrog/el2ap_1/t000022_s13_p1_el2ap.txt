The OLIVA database, constructed from the collections of Redalyc and
SciELO contains 908,982 records of documents from 1,720 journals published
between 1909 and May 2019 (see Table 1). The main
type of document is the article, representing 87% of the
records, although this percentage varies amongst the subject areas. There
is an average of 3.1 authors per document and 3.3
per article. Given that multiple authorship is a more widespread
practice in the Exact and Natural Sciences, Engineering and Biological
Sciences, this data is already indicating that we are dealing
with a production that has a broad disciplinary profile. One
might think that the journals published in the region publish
only in the vernacular languages and therefore would be mostly
from SSH since they are accustomed to publishing in local
languages. But we will see later that this is a
multilingual corpus.
