The students usually spend the time waiting for the beginning
of the class stretching individually, some of them chat –
usually catching up how they’d been since the last time.
These conversations are usually in English; those who had grown
up speaking Portuguese would use Portuguese to speak among themselves
and with some of the students who are more fluent
in Portuguese. In this way, Tiago uses Portuguese to speak
to Mariana and Sandro (Brazilians) and to Sophie and Carolina
(fluent speakers of Portuguese).
