In journals from countries where Spanish is the official language,
the share of English among articles in journals of the
Natural and Exact Sciences is 41.9% and for Engineering and
Technology, 28.4%. Portuguese is very much in the minority, and
only in the Social Sciences does it reach 2.9%. Spanish,
on the other hand, is dominant in the Medical and
Health Sciences and in the three categories of Social Sciences
and Humanities (more than 91%).
