Most digital archives that specialize in language documentation data handle
rights management similarly, though exact details vary between archives. In
most cases, the original rights holders4 retain all of their
intellectual and/or cultural property rights. The rights holders give non-exclusive
licenses to the archive and the archiveâ€™s users; details of
the licenses vary between archives and according to specific copyright
laws of the country where each archive is located. Commercial
use of the data is never allowed.
