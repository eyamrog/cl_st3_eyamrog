Publication in English is associated with a greater number of
authors. The average number of authors in the English-language articles
is 4.3. For Portuguese it is 3.3 and for Spanish,
2.7 authors per article. The relatively high number for Brazil
is also linked with the tendency of authors and journals
of Brazil to publish articles with two or more authors.
The same decreasing order (English, Portuguese, and Spanish) in the
average number of authors is observed in all areas.
