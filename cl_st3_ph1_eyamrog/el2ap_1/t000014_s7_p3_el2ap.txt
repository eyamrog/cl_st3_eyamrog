We begin by sketching out the basics of archiving for
language documentation initiatives – why archiving matters, what it offers,
and how to go about it (§2). Toward the goal
of ensuring the quality, longevity, and accessibility of resources, we
consider contemporary best practices in digital curation, the differences between
an established language archive and other online platforms, the benefits
of archiving, and decisions regarding what to archive and when
to do it. We also explore the question of deciding
where to archive – that is, determining what archives are
available and how they are set up and maintained –
particularly with an eye to Brazilian indigenous languages and associated
documentation projects; the archive of the Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi
provides an instructive case study (§3). Our discussion then considers
archives and communities, focusing on the ethics of informed consent
and issues of community access to documentation, informed by a
case study from Jorge Emilio Rosés Labrada’s work with Mako
speakers in Venezuela (§4). The significance of archiving legacy materials
– resulting from documentation carried out prior to the digital
era, and frequently represented in fragile media with a limited
lifespan – is addressed in §5. Finally, §6 returns to
the Brazilian context with a detailed case study of documentation
and archiving projects involving two indigenous languages of Brazil, Paresi-Haliti
and Enewane Nawe, carried out by Ana Paula Brandão, which
highlights many of the issues discussed in the previous sections.
Final observations are offered in §7.
