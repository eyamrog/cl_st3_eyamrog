Thus, the data corpus was analysed in order to select
instances of explanations being built as a collective activity between
teachers and students. In the 18 episodes of whole-class teaching
recorded in this module, five types of explanatory sequences were
elaborated and arranged into three broad discursive acts depending on
whether teachers were exploring, guiding, or providing an explanation.
