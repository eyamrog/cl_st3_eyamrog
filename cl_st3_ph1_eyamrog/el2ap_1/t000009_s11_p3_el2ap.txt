English for Specific Purposes (ESP) has acknowledged the complexity of
language use, teaching, and learning. Therefore, one of the main
principles of this approach is specificity. It refers to the
linguistic, textual, and contextual configuration of discourse in a given
social practice (target situation), which needs to be recognized to
prepare students to engage in that practice through genre use
(Hyland, 2002). It also refers to the needs of a
given group of students (present situation) to develop their knowledge
of those genres to the level that is recognized by
a given discourse community.
