The visual working memory subtest of the B-PREA-R was elaborated
with similar characteristics to the "Visual Memory Span" version of
the Wechsler Memory Scale Revised, being a task that has
behaved as an independent factor in several investigations when performing
a confirmatory or exploratory factor analysis (Fernandez et at., 2019;
Zapata et al., 2019; Rosas et al., 2022; Marreros-Tananta &
Guerrero-Alcedo, 2022).
