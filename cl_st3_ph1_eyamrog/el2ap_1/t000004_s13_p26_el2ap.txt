Sandro: Well as Mestre João Grande explained, and Mestre Ananias
mentions a few times, capoeira, samba and candomblé, they work

was the religion and samba was the dance they could
enjoy the time, but samba also used to be taken
as a self-defence. Samba-de-coco, samba duro, for men pernada, there
were some on the street and they take people down
with the [rasteiras?]. (Interview with Sandro - audio transcription)
