The second paradigm is interpretivist, idiographic and involving discovery. As
knowledge (or nature) is viewed as an inherently subjective human
interpretation, this paradigm focuses on specific and contextual cases. It
deals with “meanings that those participating in educational situations give
to what they experience” (Taber, 2013, p. 52). Researchers under
this paradigm believe that meanings are not pregiven but co-created
through interaction. Therefore, they might engage with participants in activities
and seek their views (Treagust et al., 2014). Guba and
Lincoln (1994) said that this approach is grounded in a
relativist ontology and subjectivist epistemology. Relativist ontology conceives that “realities
are apprehendable in the form of multiple, intangible mental constructions,
socially and experientially based” (p. 110). In contrast, a subjectivist
epistemology denotes that “the investigator and the object of investigation
are assumed to be interactively linked so that the ‘findings’
are created as the investigation proceeds” (p. 111). In this
approach, human beings are seen as agents of their own
actions and producers of their own environment. Because of this,
this perspective is deemed subjectivist and voluntarist (Cohen et al.,
2007).
