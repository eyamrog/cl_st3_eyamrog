The Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) is an independent
organization supported by libraries, publishers, and others, which accepts journals
based on a thorough review of their adherence to scholarly
standards. The Directory of Open Access Scholarly Resources is operated
by the International Center for the registration of serial publications
that manages ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) registration and accepts
data from related sources, such as DOAJ, Latindex, and Scopus,
which accounts for the greater number of journals it indexes
and the corresponding increase in JUOJS that it indexes.
