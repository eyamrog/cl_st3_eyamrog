Experimental setup in the field - The individuals were marked
from 1 to 60 with white plastic tags attached to
the youngest among the adult leaves and the most physiologically
active. Tags were attached through a punched hole in the
leaf with a plastic string. Thus identified, they were brought
to the site of the installation of the experiments in
the forest, when the plants were randomly selected by drawing,
through previously numbered pieces of paper. In these ways, the
bromeliads that were placed on the pitchfork and trunk or
on the ground were randomly chosen.
