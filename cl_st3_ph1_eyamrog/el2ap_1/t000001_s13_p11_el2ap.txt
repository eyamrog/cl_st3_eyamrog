Long-read polishing is done before short-read polishing because it is
less influenced by genomic repeats. A ‘repeat’ in this context
is a sequence which causes reads to align to multiple
and/or incorrect positions of the genome. For example, some 150-bp
short reads will be contained within the rRNA operon and
will therefore align to multiple places, making the operon a
repeat and impairing the ability of polishers to repair errors.
With 20 kbp long reads, however, all can span the
rRNA operon and therefore align uniquely, so the operon is
not a repeat, ensuring that polishing changes occur in the
correct instances of the operon.
