In this sense, the instrumental and deterministic perspectives of technology
will guide this same type of practice, which does not
match the school purposes of intellectual and integral emancipation. Such
perspectives emphasize only the face of technology as a tool
at the service of humanity, regardless of other aspects. In
the case of education, teaching how to operate tools is
not bad, but it is insufficient for educational objectives, as
it remains in use only at this level and does
not advance to concepts, that is, to explanations and understanding
socio-historical relationships. Furthermore, teaching restricted to the operational tends to
remain part of fixed everyday knowledge.
