Behind the intention of Luria and his followers, there is
a method that answers the question: how to perform the
evaluation? The answer is: through observation, interview and specific tests,
and analyzing the contents from neuropsychological factors as indicators to
interpret the actions of man and the neurological damage caused.
However, taking this question to the science of education would
exclude the vision of syndromic analysis and would guide the
educator in the assessment of the child's integral development through
evaluative methods used by her (observation and pedagogical situations).
