All the names of the football clubs were compound names
and included words from a regional language, from Tetum or
Portuguese, or from English. Moreover, the use of the acronyms
FC and AS echoed the wider conventions of international football
leagues. FC indexed the Anglophone world, although the acronym FC
came before the name and thus followed the word order
used in the names of football clubs in the Portuguese
league. According to one of the club organisers, it actually
stood for the English words: “Football Club”. AS is an
acronym commonly used in the Italian football league (as in
AS Milan), but according to one of our interviewees, it
stood for the Portuguese word Associação (Association), so – for
the members of AS Bidau - it indexed the world
of Portuguese football, which is closely followed in Timor-Leste.
