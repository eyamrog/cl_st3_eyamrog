Our aim in this paper has been to make a
contribution to the new sociolinguistics of multilingualism and mobility, focusing
in on one particular transnational population movement from the global
south to the north and west. The case of the
Timorese migrants in Northern Ireland throws the following points into
sharp focus: First, the importance of moving away from purely
synchronic description and analysis and of taking account of the
historical context of particular migration movements, of the particular nature
of the south/north entanglements involved and of the ways in
which memories of key moments in past political struggles, along
with emblems of national identity, contribute to the forging of
a sense of solidarity and belonging.
