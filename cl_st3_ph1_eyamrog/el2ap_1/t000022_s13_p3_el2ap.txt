Concerning the temporal coverage of the available data, the corpus
reveals more than a century of indexed Latin American scientific
production. The oldest document dates back to 1909 and the
most recent one to May 2019. However, 84.2% of the
articles fall within the period 2005- 2018. There are much
fewer documents in 2019 (0.67% of the articles) due to
the fact that the data collection took place between May
and June of that year, thus representing only a partial
year. The earliest documents are from the Memórias do Instituto
Oswaldo Cruz, which has 582 records between 1909 and 1939.
Then we find the first documents of the Revista Chilena
de Pediatría appearing in 1940, Bragantia in 1941, Arquivos de
Neuro-Psiquiatria in 1943 and Anais da Escola Superior de Agricultura
Luiz de Queiroz, today named Scientia Agricola, in 1944. The
first appearances of journal documents from the other countries are
in 1969 (Colombia), 1974 (Mexico), 1993 (Argentina and Cuba), 1995
(Costa Rica and Peru), 1984 - Revista de la Facultad
de Medicina (Venezuela), 2000 (Ecuador, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic and
Uruguay), 2001 (Bolivia) and 2005 (Panama). The first journal in
Social Sciences and Humanities with a record in the database
is the Revista de Administração de Empresas (1961) followed by
the Revista Latinoamericana de Psicología (1969).
