However, looking in detail at the authors from Brazil, a
heterogeneous picture emerges. There are articles by researchers from all
27 Brazilian states, but strongly concentrated in only some of
them. In the set of documents that have at least
one author from Brazil with his/her geographic state declared (n=85.528),
85.7% belong to five states. These are the states of
São Paulo (33,4%), Minas Gerais (15,4%), Rio de Janeiro (13,7%),
Rio Grande do Sul (13,1%) and Paraná (10,1%), in other
words, states in the Southeast and the South of Brazil.
