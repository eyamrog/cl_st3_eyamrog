We made our first field visits to Northern Ireland: in
October 2014 and in June 2015. We conducted participant observation
in different public settings e.g. in the Catholic Church in
Dungannon and in local sports events (particularly football matches) and
we have kept detailed field notes. We also used still
photography and we gathered different kinds of texts and artefacts,
including digital texts (e.g. postings on Facebook and on YouTube).
In addition, we carried out extended face-to-face interviews, of a
semi-structured nature, with twelve Timorese men living and working in
Dungannon and in Cookstown2. The interviews were carried out primarily
in Tetum3, with the interaction sometimes involving the blending of
Tetum with Portuguese and/or English. The interviews lasted approximately one
hour and they were all audio-recorded. Six were individual interviews
and the others were joint interviews with football team members.
They focused on the intervieweesâ€™ migration trajectories and on their
lived experiences of mooring or re-mooring in this Northern Irish
context. The six individual interviewees constituted a core group of
research participants (see Table 1 below).
