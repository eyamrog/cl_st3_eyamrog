The use of the term 'dialogic' tries to frame the
utterances in which participants make significant contributions by moving ideas
forward through critically taking account of othersâ€™ perspectives in building

the research interest, engagement in dialogic talk was operationalised by
relatively frequent occurrences of the three dialogic codes.
