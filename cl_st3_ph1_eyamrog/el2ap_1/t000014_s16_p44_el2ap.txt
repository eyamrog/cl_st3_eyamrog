Once materials have been archived, many years may pass before
they are utilized by others. For example, linguist Catherine Callaghan
(1931-2019) made a series of recordings of Sarah Ballard speaking
Bodega Miwok (Miwokan; California) in 1960, while the former was
a graduate student in linguistics at the University of California,
Berkeley (PhD, 1963). She donated these and other recordings to
the California Language Archive14 in 1979 (BALLARD and CALLAGHAN, n.d.).
Forty years later, in 2019, linguist Andrew Cowell (Berkeley PhD
in 1993) made time-aligned transcriptions of these recordings in ELAN,
which he archived with the same repository (COWELL, 2019+).15 The
two collections are linked in the archive’s digital catalog, and
so can easily be related to each other when consulting
one or the other. Similarly, linguist Gladwyn Kingsley Noble, Jr.
(1923-1994) made recordings of speakers of Wapishana and Atorai (Arawak;
Brazil, Guyana) during a single field trip to Guyana in
1965. After wending their way through the hands of different
academics, the 13 tapes were donated to the California Language
Archive around 2006 by Manjari Ohala (see GEORGE et al.,
1965). The recordings of Atorai, formerly thought to no longer
have any first-language speakers, were utilized for a preliminary phonological
description of the language by O’Hagan (2018), which was elaborated
on by E. Miller (2021) as part of an undergraduate
honors thesis. In 2021, the texts included in the recordings
were translated by remaining speakers now resident in Wapishana communities,
and may serve as a basis for a workshop dedicated
to Atorai language later in 2022 (K. RYBKA, p.c.).
