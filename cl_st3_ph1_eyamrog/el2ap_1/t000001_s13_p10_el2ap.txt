This step aims to fix as many remaining errors as
possible using only long reads. We recommend using Medaka24, which
we have found to produce more accurate results than Nanopolish25,26.
Medaka uses a neural network and comes with trained models
that correspond to specific combinations of ONT chemistry and basecaller,
so one should choose the Medaka model which most closely
matches their ONT reads. Alternatively, long-read variant callers such as
Clair327 can be used as polishers by applying the called
variants to the assembly.
