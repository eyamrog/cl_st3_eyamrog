Rhizomes erect or rarely short-creeping, sometimes forming small trunks, dictyostelic,
bearing peltate scales. Leaves monomorphic; stipes with an omega-shaped vascular
strand; laminae 1-4-pinnate; veins free; indument formed by caduceus scales
or rarely by scattered catenate hairs. Sori marginal or submarginal,
discrete, extrorse, protected by outer (not modified) and inner (modified)
indusia; spores tetrahedral-globose and trilete (Smith et al. 2006).
