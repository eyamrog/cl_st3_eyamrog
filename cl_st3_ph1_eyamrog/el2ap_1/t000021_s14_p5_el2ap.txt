The focus groups were recorded and transcribed, generating a corpus
of 103 pages. To categorize emotions, we used deductive analysis
using the list of primary and secondary emotions proposed by
Parrot (2001). Bardin's (2011) thematic content analysis was initially adopted
to investigate the strategies, using the support of the emotional
regulation models available in the literature to assist in elaborating
an open coding system of the strategies grouping them into
previous and broad categories. After defining the system, an inductive
analysis supported by the Atlas.ti software was employed to help
identify context-specific strategies and tactics not covered in the literature
and help group, quantify, and analyze the data. Thus, the
procedure of systematic comparison between coded items was performed until
data saturation, exhausting the emergence of new (sub) categories or
the need for further reorganization of data. This method revealed
a wide variety of strategies and tactics used by classroom
teachers, supported by a theoretical model of emotional regulation in
the literature (see Figure 2).
