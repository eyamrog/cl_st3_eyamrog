Communication in the capoeira sessions we observed drew on the
widest range of modalities: nameable languages such as English and
Portuguese, distinctive varieties of Portuguese, such as Afro-Brazilian Portuguese, gesture,
the body. All of these modalities interact with and are
regulated and supplemented by the modality of music, whose rhythms
set the pace for each strand in the capoeira session.
In our study we draw on the construct of translanguaging
to capture these interactions and see the whole in terms
of Deleuze and Guattariâ€™s agencement or assemblage (DELEUZE; GUATTARI, 2013).
The assemblage construct, as Canagarajah points out, helps us to
account for the bringing together of different semiotic elements into
activity such as capoeira.
