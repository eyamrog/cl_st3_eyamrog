A key element in the current discussions of scholarly publishing
refers to the change in the business model from charging
for subscriptions to charging fees to authors for publishing their
papers (Article Processing Charges, APC). We gathered the publication fee
information from the websites of each of the journals. In
most cases, the journals did not report publication fees. Upon
further analysis, we verified that the absence of this information
was due to the fact that they were indeed open
access diamond journals, i.e. they do not charge authors for
publishing or readers for accessing the contents. In our universe
of 1,720 journals, we observed that 10% of the journals
charge APCâ€™s, the majority being published in Brazil (60% of
the total 182 journals with APC). This is different from
what was observed by Appel and Albagli (2019) in considering
a larger universe of journals edited in Brazil, where the
incidence of APC was still very low. In the OLIVA
database, Brazil appears as leading the growth of this APC
business model. To a lesser extent, in descending order, are
the journals edited in Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Colombia, Peru and
Venezuela.
