Brazil and its neighboring regions are home to some of
the highest levels of linguistic diversity known around the world.
Some 300 indigenous languages are spoken in South America, and
more than half this number within Brazil (MOORE, 2007; GALUCIO,
MOORE and VAN DER VOORT, 2018, p. 195) – a
fact celebrated by UNESCO’s International Decade of Indigenous Languages, of
which the inception coincides with the writing of this article.
Yet this wealth of languages represents just a fraction of
the number that must have existed in South America on
the eve of European contact, and the processes of language
shift and loss have continued through the present day. Nearly
80 of the remaining 300 languages are now critically endangered
(MOORE, 2007). The loss of indigenous languages in Brazil continues
in spite of such initiatives as the Decreto n. 7.387
in 2010, which instituted the National Inventory of Linguistic Diversity
(INDL), a government program to survey languages and declare them
to be immaterial cultural patrimony (GALUCIO, MOORE and VAN DER
VOORT, 2018). Even today, the great majority of Brazilian and
other South American indigenous languages lack substantial description and documentation.
Perhaps half have even a minimal record in archives.
