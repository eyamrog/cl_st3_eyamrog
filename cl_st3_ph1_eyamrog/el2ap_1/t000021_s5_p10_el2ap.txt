It seems that there are also possible costs in changing
the situation. For example, although strategies such as indirect modification
can provide immediate relief, they can also install and maintain
avoidance behaviors in the long term, thus harming teachers' repertoire
and professional development (GROSS, 2015). Likewise, strategies such as exaggerating/faking
emotion may require additional effort and impact teaching performance and
teacher mental health (GROSS, 2015; TAXER; FRENZEL, 2015).
