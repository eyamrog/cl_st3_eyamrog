The relevance of this analysis for this study has to
do with recent and repeated assertions that “predatory journals are
a global threat” (Oviedo-García, 2021; Bagat, 2021; Shrestha, Timsina, &
Subedi, 2021; Grudniewicz et al., 2019; Strong 2019), with other
articles conflating predatory with OA publishing (Krawczyk & Kulczycki, 2021).
We are no less opposed, to be clear, to deceptive
and dishonest journals, wherever they are published.18 Yet the way
this is being framed as a global research threat plays
into the peripheralizing world system, bemoaned by Cetto (1997) in
the last century, while doing little to address the problem.
What might be more effective, and less damaging to global
science, is to set a publishing standard for the transparency
of journal integrity, for which we’ve begun running initial tests
(Willinsky, 2022).
