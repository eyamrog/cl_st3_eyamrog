Through 2009, the activities of linguists based at the Goeldi
resulted in a large set of diverse recording media: cassette
tapes, DAT tapes, mini-disks, Hi-8 tapes, mini-DV tapes, etc. Due
to time and budget constraints, this collection was simply placed
in drawers, without systematization. From 2009 to 2014, linguist Ana
Vilacy Galucio coordinated a project supported by the CFDD/Ministry of
Justice to digitize and catalog the collection, following the practices
of the best international archives. To streamline the process of
cataloging and storing recordings and their metadata, scripts were created
by Sebastian Drude and Rose Costa, reducing the time required
by 70%. Thus the Goeldi's digital linguistic archive was created.
