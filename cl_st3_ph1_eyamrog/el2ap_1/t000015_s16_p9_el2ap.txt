Today, English hegemony is facing challenges in the name of
“bibliodiversity,” which Monica Berger, New York City College of Technology,
places at the center of decolonizing the OA movement in
research (2021; Shearer, 2019). A “position statement” on this question
of research and language has been issued by the Chilean
scholar Federico Navarro, La Universidad de O'Higgins, and eleven other
faculty from around the globe, “challenge(s) assumptions made about the
use of English as a ‘lingua franca’ in scientific-academic contexts,”
by identifying its deleterious effects on knowledge production, while arguing
for “why we, as research communities in different fields and
regions, should use multiple languages and varieties to promote transnational
dialogue in scientific-academic contexts” (2022). Similarly, Suresh Canagarajah, at Penn
State, expresses his hope this bibliodiversity amounts to a “gradual
chipping away at power, to decolonize writing and scholarship as
diverse communicative spaces, which will complement the parallel activism for
large scale institutional and policy changes” (2022, p. 20). The
commitment to such change within scholarly communication is reflected in
the international array of signatories to the 2019 Helsinki Initiative
on Multilingualism.
