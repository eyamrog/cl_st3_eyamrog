It is interesting to compare these forms of collaboration that
we have been observing in OLIVA with other databases where
international collaboration of authors from these countries is much higher,
and trending upwards. According to data from SCOPUS, 23.9% of
articles authored by at least one author of Brazil in
2011 showed some form of international collaboration. This increased to
29.6% in 2015, and in 2020 reached 36.1%. In the
case of Argentina, the values for the same years are
40.4%, 42.8% and 49.9%, respectively7. However, it is worth remembering
that Brazilâ€™s share is significantly higher than that of the
rest of the countries in the region (according to Scopus,
articles by authors of Brazil represent 48% of the documents
produced in Latin America in the period 1996- 2020).
