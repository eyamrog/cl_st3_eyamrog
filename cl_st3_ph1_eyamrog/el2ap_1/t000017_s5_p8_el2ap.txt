In the subtest counting non-symbolic quantities, a task similar to
the subtest "quantitative concepts", Series A, in the Woodcock-Muñoz Battery
III, achievement test (Muñoz- Sandoval et al., 2005), the child
must identify quantities between 3 and 12 elements in a
figure, and then search for that same quantity among four
options, employing numerical cognitive processing operations such as enumeration and
comparison of quantities. Behind these operations the child must maintain
the goal to solve the problem, and in turn must
employ various numerical, verbal and visual reasoning strategies (Spiegel et
al., 2021).
