In a qualitative study with professional and technological education, for
instance, contextual emotional demands in the classroom were identified and
grouped into three categories: affective interaction events (e.g., conflict with
students and inappropriate behavior), technical-pedagogical (e.g., learning difficulties and student
demotivation), and intrapersonal (e.g., frustration and emotional dissonance). These elements
seem to evoke various negative emotions in teachers, thus requiring
adequate regulation to minimize their harmful impact on teachers' performance
and well-being (Morais, Gondim, & Palma, in press).
