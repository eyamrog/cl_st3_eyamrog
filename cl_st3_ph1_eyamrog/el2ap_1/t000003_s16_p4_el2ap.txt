There have been two overlapping routes into employment in the
UK for these young migrants from Timor- Leste: First, some
have followed the long-established labour migration routes from mainland Portugal,
and from Madeira, into the rural sector. This has led
to the clustering of Timorese migrant workers in small towns
and in rural areas of England (e.g. in Devon and
Lincolnshire) and Northern Ireland (in County Tyrone). In Northern Ireland,
factories linked to food production have been established (e.g. factories
designed for the processing and packaging of poultry and other
meat) (DOYLE; MCAREAVEY, 2016). Other Timorese migrants have moved into
urban areas (e.g., Bridgewater, Bristol, Oxford, Peterborough, Leeds, London and
Northwich, near Manchester) and have found work within the service
sector (e.g. supermarkets, department stores, online shopping/packing services). Whether they
are based in rural or urban areas, they occupy precarious
positions with the local economy and are part of what
Standing (2010) refers to as the growing “global precariat”. They
are generally recruited by employment agencies and are expected to
work to flexible schedules.
