In the research reported in Author (XXXX), there were three
questions about group-work interaction, more specifically; 1) How can small-group
dialogue in a Brazilian primary school be characterised? 2) How
did it change over the course of the intervention? and;
3) Did the groups become more dialogic ? For context,
the research project was based on a teacher professional development
programme to promote dialogic talk both in small-group work and
whole-class teaching.
