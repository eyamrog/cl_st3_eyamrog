The roda typically occupied only about last 15 minutes of
Sandro’s class and it did not always happen due to
time constraints or low numbers of people. It was, however,
a prominent part of the workshops, where it also took
place at the end. It is an opportunity for a
spontaneous game of capoeira, not a time for learning, but
putting in practice one’s skills and enjoying and expressing oneself,
whether through singing, playing instruments or playing capoeira.
