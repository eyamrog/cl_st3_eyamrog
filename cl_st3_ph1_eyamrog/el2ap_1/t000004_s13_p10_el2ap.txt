the number and type of instruments used may vary on
each occasion. The most important of these instruments is the
berimbau, originating in Africa. The other instruments used in capoeira
are the atabaque (drum), pandeiro (tambourine), reco-reco (a wooded serrated
instrument played with a stick) and agog√¥ (cowbells). . People
who do not have an instrument mark the rhythm by
clapping their hands.
