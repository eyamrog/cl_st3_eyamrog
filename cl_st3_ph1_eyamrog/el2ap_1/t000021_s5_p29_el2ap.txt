It can also be said that teachers try to prevent,
anticipate, and prepare for events that occur in the classroom
(TAXER; GROSS, 2018). And even when they have no choice
or influence over teaching situations, they regulate emotions to adjust
their emotional responses and those of students (AKBARI et al.,
2016). When preventive strategies can no longer be used due
to a lack the repertoire and resources or when the
situation is highly adverse, teachers tend to resort to reactive
strategies. This might be an attempt to control the impulse
of action of the unwanted emotion and mitigate its effects
(e.g., SHEPPES, 2014; SUTTON, 2004; SUTTON et al., 2009; TAXER;
GROSS, 2018). It was also possible to infer that the
regulatory process occurs in a cyclical, dynamic, and contextual way,
suggesting that teachers resort to a chain of strategies to
cope with emotional modulation, in line with the Process Model
of Emotional Regulation (GROSS, 2015). In addition, regulation appears to
be influenced by professional factors (area of expertise and career)
and specific to the situation (demands) (SHEPPES, 2014; ENGLISH et
al., 2017).
