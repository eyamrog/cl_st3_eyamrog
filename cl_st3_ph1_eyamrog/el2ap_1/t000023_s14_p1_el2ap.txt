The study was carried out in three cities in Espírito
Santo State: Baixo Guandu, Colatina and Linhares. Detailed information on
study area and sampling design are available in Zorzal-Almeida et
al. (2021). For taxonomic and ecological analysis, a minimum of
five non-permanent slides were prepared for each sample. Material was
observed and photographed, respectively, with a Motic Panthera L digital
binocular upright Olympus microscope and a Moticam 3.0 MP camera.
The following taxonomic features were observed for identification and description
of the material at the microscope: cell shape, number and
position of chloroplasts and pyrenoids, cell wall structure, and metric
data such as cell length and width, and isthmus width.
Cell length (L), cell width (W) and isthmus width (I)
were measured using Motic Image Plus 3.0 software. Identification was
based on classic literature (e.g. Ralfs 1848, West & West
1895, 1902, Croasdale 1956, Scott & Grönblad 1957, Krieger 1932)
and recent papers (e.g. Coesel & Meesters 2007, Oliveira et
al. 2016, Bicudo et al. 2019, etc.).
