Along similar lines, trends analogous to those mentioned above can
be analyzed by observing articles by authors of different countries
and the country of the journal (see Figure 7). The
first thing that emerges from this analysis is that, for
the countries in question, articles are published above all in
journals of the same countries as the authors. This feature
is particularly pronounced in the case of authors from Brazil:
93.7% of the articles which they author are published in
journals of Brazil. Chile comes second, yet it represents only
1.6% of the total of articles. In bibliometric studies based
on the mainstream indexing sources, this characteristic is generally interpreted
as academic inbreeding, thus frequently resulting in a negative assessment.
In the following section we propose an alternative approach which
contrasts with simply attributing this national collaboration to practices of
academic inbreeding. It is based on a detailed study of
the relevant number of articles authored by Brazilians and published
in Brazil.
