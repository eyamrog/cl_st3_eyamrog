Recent studies in emotion regulation have underscored that strategies have
different outcomes depending on the context (ALDAO; SHEPPES; GROSS, 2015;
Gross, 2015). As such, the strategy's efficacy and adequacy should
not be assessed a priori because its adaptive nature (i.e.,
costs and benefits) must be considered in light of contextual
factors (e.g., ALDAO; SHEPPES; GROSS, 2015; GROSS, 2015). Furthermore, each
regulatory effort might lead to changes in the regulator, the
situation, and the interaction partners. Such changes might generate new
emotion regulation demands and require additional strategies in a random
and alternative way until there is no need for further
regulation, thus creating a feedback loop (GROSS, 2015; TAXER; GROSS,
2018). These issues represent recent advancements in emotion regulation research,
as pointed out by Taxer and Gross (2018). However, such
a model has not been consistently explored, especially in work
contexts where there has been a trend towards mainly examining
two major strategies, i.e., cognitive reappraisal and suppression (MALLORY; RUPP,
2016).
