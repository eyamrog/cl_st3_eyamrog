Files in ELAN have at least three lines of annotations:
the transcription, the translation, and the notes. More detailed information
about the glosses of Paresi or EN morphemes (i.e. the
interlinearization) is organized in the FLEx program, as it allows
automatic insertion of glosses (once they are already entered in
the database), unlike ELAN. Neither language has an established orthography
that is used consistently in indigenous schools. Therefore, transcriptions were
made in the orthographies that the speakers know and, in
the case of Paresi, they were systematized according to the
orthography that Brand√£o proposed for the language.
