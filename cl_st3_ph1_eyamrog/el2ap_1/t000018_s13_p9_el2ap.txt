The observation of several neurological patients allowed Luria to distinguish
a field of science that has been enhanced since the
late 90's of the last century. Previously, these neurological patients
were analyzed from organic psychophysiology, i.e., the analysis was oriented
towards brain reflexes to explain their behavior; however, it failed
to analyze these reflexes in human activity. In this sense,
Luria recognizes the importance of the psychophysiology of activity, which
is directed not to breathing as an unconditioned reflex, but
rather to how the subject uses breathing in his own
activity: in sports, in singing, in swimming. (16)
