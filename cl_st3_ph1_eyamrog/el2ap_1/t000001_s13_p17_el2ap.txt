If automation is required, changes in the workflow are needed.
Flye19 is less likely than other long- read assemblers to
produce large-scale errors which downstream polishers may not be able
to fix23, making it a good replacement for Trycycler. Before
polishing with Medaka, circular Flye contigs should be ‘rotated’ to
a consistent starting sequence (e.g. dnaA36) or random starting sequence.
This will serve to move any duplicated/missing bases at the
start/end of circular contigs to the middle of the sequence
where polishing tools can repair the error. For short-read polishing,
we recommend Polypolish followed by POLCA, as these tools are
the least likely to introduce errors30.
