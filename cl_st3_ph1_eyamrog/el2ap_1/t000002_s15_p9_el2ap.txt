A coding scheme was devised based on previous works from
the literature and comprised a set of ten codes relevant
to dialogic classroom talk at the utterance level. The resulting
scheme contained ten categories divided into three contexts: content, task
and off-topic that discriminate the utteranceâ€™s tenor. That is, the
codes can be arranged to distinguish if the utterance is
related to the content proposed in the task (topic under
discussion); if it is related to task procedures or class
management; or, ultimately, if it is off-topic, talk neither focused
on content nor task (Table 1).
