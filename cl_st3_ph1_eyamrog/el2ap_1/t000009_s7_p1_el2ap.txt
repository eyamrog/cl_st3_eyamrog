Education, as a dialogical social practice, is a dynamic and
complex system that emerges out of the interaction of multiple
factors (Mason, 2008). Society, individuals, institutions, disciplinary content, pedagogical and
psychological theories are, at the same time, constituted within the
interaction of social, historical, cultural, ideological, and financial factors, as
well as elements that shape and are shaped by education.
From this perspective, educational features are singular to contextual needs
and constraints. Moreover, they are contextually organized in a never-ending
movement of change.
