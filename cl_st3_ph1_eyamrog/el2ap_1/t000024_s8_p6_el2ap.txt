In Brazil, the bromeliad Aechmea distichantha Lem. is distributed in
areas of Cerrado and Atlantic Rainforest in the States of
Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Paraná,
Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul and Mato Grosso do
Sul (Forzza et al. 2010, Faria et al. 2022). Wittrockia
cyathiformis (Vell.) Leme occurs in the Atlantic Rainforest between the
States of Minas Gerais and Santa Catarina, from 750 to
1,900 m of altitude (Wanderley et.al. 2007). Both bromeliads have
a facultative habit and are pollinized by birds (Cestari 2009).
Aechmea distichantha has been considered as a vulnerable species (Martinelli
et al. 2008) and least concern (Faria et al. 2022).
W. cyathiformis as an endemic (Martinelli et al. 2008, Tardivo
2022). Plants of A. distichantha flowers throughout the year, while
the flowering period of W. cyathiformis is from April to
June and from August to December (Wanderley et al. 2007).
Individuals of these two species were rescued, during deforestation caused
by the construction of a road project, which began in
2013 (Mário Covas Highway, São Paulo, Brazil).
