Data archiving facilitates collaboration on many levels. For researchers who
are engaged in remote collaboration with the speech community or
other researchers, archiving data as they are created or as
analyses are finished helps the entire project team stay organized.
Also, once data are organized and archived, they can be
discovered by other researchers, which in turn can lead to
new opportunities for collaboration. Finally, archiving data helps to facilitate
the reuse of the primary data for various research purposes,
including a great deal of work that is being done
in the areas of natural language processing and linguistic typology.
Finally, archived data can be cited, and this is crucial
for creating reproducible research (BEREZ- KROEKER et al., 2018). Some
journals, such as Language Documentation & Conservation, request that the
data sets associated with an article be archived and cited
appropriately. Thus, researchers can and should cite their own archived
data, and researchers who use archived data must cite them
as well.
