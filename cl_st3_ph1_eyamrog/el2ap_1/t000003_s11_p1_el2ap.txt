The last decade of the twentieth century and the first
decade of the twenty-first century saw a surge of interest,
across the social sciences, in globalisation. In the sociological and
anthropological literature of this period, there was a wealth of
theory-building and commentary on the changing social and cultural conditions
of the late modern age (e.g. HARVEY, 1989, APPADURAI, 1996,
CASTELLS, 2000, HANNERZ, 1996). Attention was drawn to the different
types of changes ushered in by globalisation: the intensification of
transnational population flows, the rapid development of new communication technologies
and the transformation of the political and economic landscapes of
different regions of the world.
