The removal of vegetation cover for road work can result
in the loss of plant biodiversity. Consequently, mitigation measures are
necessary to minimize this effect (Stumpf et al. 2008). Among
the alternatives, the relocation of plant species removed from the
area destined to road works in conservation sites where the
natural occurrence of these species has been detected (Araújo 2006).
Primack (2008) and, more recently, Guardia et al. (2021) and
Suzuki et al. (2021) have highlighted the importance of transplanting
species from areas aimed for vegetation removal to other places
considered suitable for their relocation, as has been recommended by
Jasper et al. (2005) and Duarte & Gandolfi (2013), primarily
in protected areas (Santos Júnior & Tamaki 2014).
