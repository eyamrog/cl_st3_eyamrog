Our study highlights some important considerations for studies involving water
immersion to accelerate seed/pyrene germination and the ex-situ conservation of
a tropical palm species. The results reveal that water imbibition
of seeds enclosed by a thick endocarp was not blocked,
promoting the seeds germination. Copernicia alba Morong seed did not
display dormancy, exhibiting a high germination capacity in the control.
The pyrenes stored for one year at 19Â°C under a
relative humidity of 45% decreased the water content from 10
(initial) to 7% and germination rates by almost 50%. Therefore,
we suggested that our study species should be classified as
orthodox. Soaking in water for 48 and 72h improved the
germination rate and time of freshly harvested and stored seeds;
however, hot treatments reduced the germination capacity delaying the germination
time.
