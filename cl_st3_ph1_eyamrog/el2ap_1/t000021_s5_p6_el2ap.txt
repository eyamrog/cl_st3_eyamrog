However, cognitive change also involves costs. For example, although attributing
external causality helps mitigate negative emotions in the short term,
it can also put long-term performance at risk by exempting
teachers from responsibility for students' development (PEREIRA; MARINOTTI; LUNA, 2004).
In addition, teachers also reassess the situation, their performance, and
their ability negatively, taking responsibility for unpleasant circumstances through self-blame.
This type of evaluation might damage teachers' well-being because they
perceive themselves as inadequate and incapable, leading to feeling frustrated,
distressed, and guilty (CLARÃ€, 2017). Thus, cognitive change focusing on
the negative can enhance negative emotions and strengthen apathy and
impotence, reducing the repertoire to deal with circumstances.
