There are other instances of communication through gesture, which serve
to mark a transition. Apart from entering the roda through
the space in front of the leader of the roda,
described above, a capoeirista can ‘buy’ the game. To buy
a game, any person standing in the roda can replace
one of the players by indicating that they want to
join the game by stretching out their hand towards the
centre of the roda, with the palm facing the person
they want to play with. This way of entering the
game is usually used in more dynamic rodas. Gestures are,
therefore, essential for establishing the order of action in the
roda, as well as showing respect towards each other and
are part of the linguistic and cultural learning involved in
capoeira practice.
