Data analysis was based on Aaker and Day (1990), in
whose methodology nominal and ordinal analyses of tabulated data are
conducted. In the former, personal, academic, and professional features of
the subjects were identified, and in the latter, features that
recurred among participants were analyzed. Because the questionnaire was online,
data were automatically tabulated, and Microsoft Word and Excel were
used for data description and analysis, as well as for
the design of tables and charts.
