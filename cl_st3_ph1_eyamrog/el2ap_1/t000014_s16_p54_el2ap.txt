The primary data – audio and video recordings – were
recorded in .WAV and .MTS formats, respectively. Each session was
recorded in audio and video. Later, the .MTS files were
converted to .MP4 for archiving, to yield a more compact
format for storage. The file names begin with the ISO
code for the language (PAB for Paresi and UNK for
EN), followed by the recording date (in YYYY/MM/DD format), the
abbreviations of the names of the person who recorded and
of the primary speaker, and the keyword of the session
in which the file is included; for example: UNK-20200114-WE-YI-Kolito.MTS. These
documentation projects generated digital collections involving more than 150 hours
of Paresi recordings and 37 hours of Enawene Nawe recordings,
which are organized into seven categories, as illustrated in Table
1.
