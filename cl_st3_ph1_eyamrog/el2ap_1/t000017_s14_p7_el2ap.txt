Internal structure validity. An exploratory factor analysis was performed to
identify the number and composition of components necessary to summarize
the observed scores of the B-PREA-R. To determine this analysis,
the theoretical assumptions suggested by Lloret-Segura et al. (2014) were
taken into account: normality of the data, Kaiser-Meyer- Olkin test
(KMO), and the advantages offered by the different extraction and
rotation methods.
