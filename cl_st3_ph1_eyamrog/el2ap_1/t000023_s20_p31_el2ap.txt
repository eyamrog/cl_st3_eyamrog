Note: Just a single specimen of this species was detected
during the present study. When compared to Silva & Cecy’s
(2004) population, current specimen is much longer and has less
prominent marginal undulations. It is also smaller when compared to
Felisberto & Rodrigues (2010) material, and has fewer undulations at
the lateral margins when compared to Menezes et al. (2011).
Cosmarium impressulum may be mistaken by Cosmarium undulatum Corda ex
Ralfs, but according to Bicudo et al. (2019), however, they
are distinct in the number of marginal undulations (C. undulatum
has 10- 12 undulations, whereas C. impressulum has up to
6), and their cell dimensions (C. undulatum is comparatively larger:
44-64 x 30-52 µm).
