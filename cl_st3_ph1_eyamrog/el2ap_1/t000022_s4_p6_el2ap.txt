The study of the production published in SciELO and Redalyc
has allowed us to discuss some suppositions that permeate the
recognition of scientific knowledge, in other words, that of the
prioritization of the journals commonly characterized as "mainstream" while discrediting
the rest. OLIVA reveals two dimensions of this scientific communication
space of increasing editorial quality. First, its diversity, and thematic
and linguistic breadth. Second, the international and inter-institutional collaboration at
the national level, which encourages a perspective beyond the traditional
opposing duality of the "mainstream or global circuit‚Äù - led
by the most prestigious journals - and the "regional or
local circuits", with limited circulation. This duality, promoted in the
context of the commercialization of journals and reinforced as a
"should be" by the assessment systems through the use of
the journals' Impact Factor, has undervalued non-commercial open access publications
such as those we are concerned with in this study.
This perspective has also failed to appreciate the forms of
intra-national collaboration whose complexity we seek to show in this
paper for the case of Brazil, and which are of
particular relevance for research addressing local issues that are enhanced
in particular in this type of collaboration. We also point
out the linguistic particularities of Brazil which explain, to a
large extent, trends in collaboration when nationally edited journals are
up against mainstream journals.
