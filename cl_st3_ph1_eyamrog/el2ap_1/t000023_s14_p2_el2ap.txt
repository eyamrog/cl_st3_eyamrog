Environmental conditions were described according to ecosystem type (rivers, lagoons
and lakes), trophic state index (TSI), and pH (method specifications
in Zorzal-Almeida et al. 2021), classified as acid (< 6.5),
alkaline (> 7.5) and circumneutral (6.5-7.5) (Šťastný 2010). Occurrence frequency
of each taxon was calculated according to Zorzal-Almeida et al.
(2021). To highlight the first citations for Espírito Santo State,
taxa are marked with [*] and the first citations for
Brazil with [**]. Samples studied during the present inventory are
deposited at the Herbarium VIES/UFES.
