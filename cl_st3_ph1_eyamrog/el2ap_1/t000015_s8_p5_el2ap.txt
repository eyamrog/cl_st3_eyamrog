In the first decade of the twenty-first century, Ezra Ondari-Okemwa,
an information science scholar at Machakos University, noted how the
region’s shortfalls in “the technological capability to support electronic knowledge
transfer and scholarly publishing” were matched by the regional publications’
“lack [of] visibility” (2007). What this means for researchers is
summed by PLOS publisher Alison Muddit: “The need to achieve
credibility and visibility within the global research system” means researchers
in the Global South choosing “between a desire to strengthen
local platforms and outlets that better serve local needs and
feeling pulled to ‘play the game’ in which norms have
been set by the Global North” (2020; see also Alperin
and Rozemblum, 2017).
