Germination of pretreated pyrenes - Freshly harvested pyrenes were used
to determine the effect of soaking pyrenes in water compared
to the control (untreated/non-soaked pyrenes) under laboratory conditions. For the
pretreatments, pyrenes were immersed in water at room temperature (~25°C)
for 24h; 48h; and 72h; and in hot water at
75°C for 5 min and 10 min. Plastic trays (20
x 30 x 9 cm) were used to maintain the
seeds immersed in water under constant fluorescent light for the
desired times, with daily water replacement.
