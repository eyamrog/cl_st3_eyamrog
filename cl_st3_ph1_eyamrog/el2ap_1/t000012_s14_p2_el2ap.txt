We calculated the H of the cleaning bird species observed
cleaning in Brazil and Africa registered in two previous works
(Sazima et al. 2012; Mikula et al. 2017). Based on
the birds species identified as cleaners, we selected the families
that the species belong to. We identified a total number
of 26 families. Then we compared the mean H of
the 26 different bird families without the observed cleaners, with
the mean H only of the cleaners, in the same
given families (Fig 2). Our aim was to uncover a
bias of generalist diet habits of cleaners, as we hypothesized
that the cleaners would represent the species of their families
with more diversification on their feeding habits. The details of
the calculated H of the species and families can be
accessed in Supplementary fig. 1.
