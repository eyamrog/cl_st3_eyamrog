Third, the case of the Timorese migrants in Northern Ireland
demonstrates the value of adopting the notion of trajectory as
a conceptual compass: It enables us to foreground two processes
in particular: (1.) the ways in which educational backgrounds, combined
with migration trajectories, shape the communicative repertoires, language resources and
funds of knowledge available to migrants; and (2.) the ways
in which individual migrants, with particular linguistic repertoires and resources,
which have higher value on the local linguistic market, are
able to assume local leadership roles in creating local communities
of practice and organising life world activities around sports like
football.
