The results of this study also allow us to infer
that the strategies are not inherently "good" or "bad," although
it is admitted that some of them are more adaptive
(GROSS, 2015). However, this assessment depends on the context, available
resources, expected outcomes, and extent of the effects (immediate or
long-term) (e.g., ALDAO et al., 2015; GROSS, 2015; ENGLISH et
al., 2017). Thus, the form and the function of the
different strategies teachers employ from a contextual perspective might be
located in the second generation of studies in emotion regulation
research. This suggests that strategies have costs and benefits, revealing
inconsistencies in applying the labels such as adaptive or maladaptive
a priori. Additionally, it is in line with Sheppes (2014)
and Aldao et al. (2015) perspective that skillful regulation results
from the flexible choice of strategies to adapt to different
emotional demands.
