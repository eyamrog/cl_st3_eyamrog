Some countries stand out because their journals follow a different
trend. In Brazil, in the Medical and Health Sciences journals,
articles with only one author account for 5% of the
articles, while those with 4-8 authors represent 61.8% of the
total. In all other areas, the journals of Brazil show
the same tendency of having articles with a greater number
of authors. Another interesting case is Colombia, with a pronounced
concentration of articles with two or three authors (instead of
4-8 authors as the rest). In Agricultural Sciences it totals
56.3% of the articles, in Medical and Health Sciences 41.7%,
in Natural and Exact Sciences 59.9% and in Engineering and
Technology 63.8%. All these data for Colombian journals show notably
higher percentages than the aggregate of the rest of the
countries in Table 3.
