The results also show that W. cyathiformis plants (table 2)
relocated as terricolous or epiphytic did not show significant differences
in survival rates. Therefore, the form of relocation did not
influence survival during the experiment for this species. Nevertheless, the
survival rate was significantly reduced over time in both relocation
forms, being constant from 252 days until the end of
the experiment at 60% (table 2). This behaviour indicates that
W. cyathiformis is under stress after 196 days of transplanting,
until the definitive establishment. Jasper et al. (2005) relocated 14
bromeliad species rescued from the clearing of a forest area
aimed at hydro-energetic use. These authors verified a 67% mean
survival after relocation, varying from 79% to 50% according to
the species, in a period of 10 months after transplantation.
Barrancos et al. (2016) showed that the survival rate of
tank bromeliad Werauhia gladioliflora (H. Wendl.) J. R. Grant fixed
onto trunks and branches after nine months varied among sites
between 65 and 95%, although the period of evaluation was
shorter than in the present study (12.4 months). Duarte &
Gandolfi (2013) observed similar survival rates (75.9%) for Aechmea bromeliifolia
(Rudge) Baker one year after relocation as an epiphyte. The
vulnerability of epiphytes after relocation can be explained by the
fact that they do not receive irrigation and depend on
rainfall events for water uptake (Benzing 2000). Consequently, epiphytes are
constantly and naturally exposed to drought. For instance, Carvalho et
al. (2017) showed a significant decrease by 37% of relative
water content (RWC) in plants of Guzmania monostachia (L.) Rusby
ex Mez exposed to eight days without water irrigation, as
similar to the relocation effects observed herein.
