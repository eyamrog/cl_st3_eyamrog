The infrastructure began to improve with the acquisition, through research
projects, of good quality cassette tape recorders, as well as
microphones, laptops and solar equipment. In 1996, the World Bank’s
Centers of Excellence program brought Digital Audio Tape (DAT) players,
Hi-8 video recorders, a Hi-8 editing island and professional storage
cabinets. On the basis of accumulated experience, Goeldi linguists, including
fellows and affiliates, have successfully competed in international documentation programs
that are favorable to projects in developing countries. In the
early 2000s, projects from the Endangered Languages Documentation Programme (ELDP)
and the Dokumentation Bedrohter Sprachen program (DOBES) provided more equipment
and experience. Documentation and procurement of equipment (e.g. solid state
recorders with flash memory) continued into the second half of
the decade, with support from USAID, UNESCO and the Ambassador’s
Fund (US Embassy). MCTI supplied equipment in 2007, including a
server as the basis for a digital repository. Documentation (and
research) projects continued in the second half of the 2000s,
with support from CNPq, DOBES and ELDP. This progress was
threatened in 2007 by fulminating attacks by a small group
of linguists, who opposed the ProDocLin Museum's linguistic documentation program,9
international documentation programs and digital archives (MOORE and GALUCIO, 2016,
p. 40). Fortunately, this opposition did not attract support among
Brazilian linguists and progress continued, both at the Goeldi Museum
and in Brazil.
