Spoken language can also be substituted by the demonstration of
the movement alone. On one occasion, Sandro gathers his students
at one side of the room and starts performing a
movement in silence, moving towards the other side of the
room, with his students following him. Sandro does not need
to explain verbally what he requires from his students â€“
the activity is familiar.
