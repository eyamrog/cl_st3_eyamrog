Although opportunism may be a central component of some ecological
networks, opportunistic species coexist with highly specialized lifestyles that are
also part of the network. Some highly specialized lifestyles are
extreme specialists that interact with single partners, such as some
gall-making insects, floral parasites, myrmecophytes, and anemonefishes. Other highly specialized
lifestyles are highly connected species which rely upon a diversity
of partners (i.e., a network) to persist. Examples of these
highly connected lifestyles include obligate nectarivorous insects, obligate frugivorous birds,
cleaner fishes, hypercarnivores, and highly specialized cleaning birds, such as
the oxpeckers. By exploring how ecological networks combine opportunists and
specialized lifestyles we may obtain insights on how ecological and
evolutionary processes built up species-rich assemblages of interacting species.
