Cleaning interactions are interspecific associations in which cleaners benefit from
the hosts by feeding on parasites, injured tissues, or blood.
All around the globe there is a remarkable diversity of
birds that behave as cleaners of large mammals. Here we
investigated the drivers shaping the organization of networks formed by
cleaning birds and host mammals. We used two cleaner-host networks,
one from Brazilian openlands and the other one from African
openlands, to explore the relationship between diet generalism and cleaning
behavior. We hypothesize that cleaning interactions are often opportunistic and,
as a consequence, we expect that generalist species are the
main components of cleaner-host networks. We first contrast the diet
diversity of cleaner species with their closed related species. For
18 of 26 bird families, cleaners show higher diet diversity
than closely-related, non-cleaning species. Then we explored if birds with
higher diversity diets are the central species of the cleaner-host
networks. The results show that there is no apparent correlation
between species centrality in the networks and their diet diversity.
We suggest that generalism allows opportunist species to engage in
cleaning interactions, but the importance of a cleaner species is
affected by other attributes, such as abundance and behavioral traits
associated with cleaning behavior. In a broader perspective, these results
suggest that the factors that may allow species to participate
in ecological networks are not the same that modulate their
role in the same networks.
