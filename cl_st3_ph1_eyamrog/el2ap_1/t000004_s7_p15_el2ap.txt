Sandro: Capoeira is for everyone. You can pick what suits
you in capoeira, you know, but the elements as I’ve
mentioned, I used to be a fighter, I became a
capoeirista player a few years ago because I used to
fight all the time. I have marks of fight in
Brazil. I’ve been stabbed by knife, I’ve been shot by
gun, I’ve been, bottles breaking my head, and my belly
being cut into the fight. So that’s how I raised
my style. (Interview with Sandro - audio transcription)
