Content validity. An item analysis was performed to obtain and
analyze the contents of the B-PREA-R. The item analysis was
performed considering the values of the discrimination index (item-total correlation)
and the item difficulty index. The discrimination index was classified
according to the criteria of Ebel & Frisbie (cited in
Backhoff et al., 2000): an item with high quality presents
values â‰¥.39, an item with good quality presents values between
.30 and .39, an item with fair quality presents values
between .20 and .29, and an item with low quality
presents values < .20. The difficulty index was classified according
to Crocker and Algina (1986) as low difficulty (.80); medium
difficulty (between .79 and .50) and high difficulty (<.50).
