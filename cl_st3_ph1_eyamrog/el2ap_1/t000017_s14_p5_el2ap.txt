The Pre-Academic Battery for Educators (B-PREA-R) was used. This test
has as its antecedent the Pre-Academic Battery developed in Cuba
to assess the cognitive development of children in the preschool
stage in a Cuban context (Ram√≠rez et al, 2018). The
B-PREA-R has nine subtests grouped into 199 items of different
cognitive abilities such as attention, language, working memory, numerical cognitive
processing, motor skills and thinking. These subtests allow the evaluation
of the child's cognitive development in different activities typical of
this stage (drawing, listening to stories, role- playing). These activities
include the skills and knowledge of each dimension of education
and development required by the methodological guidelines for the improvement
of early childhood education in Cuba (Gallo, et al., 2018),
as shown in Table 2.
