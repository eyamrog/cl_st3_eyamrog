Capoeira songs represent another important area of use of Portuguese
language in the context of capoeira. It needs to be
observed that although most of these songs are in Portuguese,
there is also, as Sandro points out, a small but
significant number of songs in other languages, such as Yoruba
or contain lexical elements from other languages. The students are
required to sing the songs during the class, which means
they need to memorize them so that they are able
to actively reproduce them. The songs are also extremely rich
in terms of references to the history and culture of
capoeira and of Brazil, which as we have seen Sandro
typically explains in English.
