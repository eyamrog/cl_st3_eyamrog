Rhizomes short to long-creeping, protostelic with internal phloem, or rarely
solenostelic, bearing basally attached, nonclathrate scales or hairs. Leaves monomorphic;
laminae simple to 3- pinnate or rarely more dissected; veins
usually free, occasionally anastomosing and then without included veinlets; indument
generally absent or formed by 2-celled glandular hairs. Sori marginal
or submarginal, extrorse, elongate to linear, protected by outer (not
modified) and inner (modified) indusia; spores tetrahedral and trilete, or
rarely bilateral and monolete (Smith et al. 2006).
