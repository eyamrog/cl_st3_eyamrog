This is a tactical space, as being pushed towards the
limits of the roda (delimitated by the people sitting) puts
a capoeirista into a disadvantageous position, as he/she is able
to perform only a limited range of moves. When pushed
towards the boundaries of the roda, a capoeirista will usually
try to find a way to escape and find a
better position.
