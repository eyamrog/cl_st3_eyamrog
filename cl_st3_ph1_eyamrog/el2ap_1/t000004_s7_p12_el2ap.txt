Sandro mediates Portuguese and capoeira practice to the group, with
a distinct emphasis on capoeira history and culture. He has
had an interesting trajectory into capoeira, having learnt capoeira in
a tough school. It started in his early teens, when
he was bullied at school in Paraná: “I was the
only fat black kid” he tells Jolana. While selling ice
cream in the street, he notices an informal group of
youths practising capoeira moves and when he later approaches them,
they let him train with them.
