Three of these young Timorese (RS, HA and MFB), who
had had sojourns in Portugal or England before moving to
Northern Ireland, spoke Portuguese and English with some ease and
fluency. However, all of those who had arrived in the
second decade of the twenty first century had come directly
from Timor-Leste to join friends and family who were already
working in Northern Ireland. Most of this group spoke rather
little English and virtually no Portuguese. They spoke a regional
Timorese language and they all spoke Tetum and some Bahasa
Indonesia. As in Timor-Leste, Tetum had become the main language
of wider communication in this Irish context.
