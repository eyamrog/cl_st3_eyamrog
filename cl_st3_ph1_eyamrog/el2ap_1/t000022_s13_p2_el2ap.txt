The journals edited in Brazil represent 29.4% of the total
and account for 48.9% of the total number of documents
and 50.1% of the articles. This predominance of Brazilian production
is reflected even more prominently in the number of authors,
given the growing trend in that country towards collaboration among
3 or more researchers, including in the social sciences and
humanities. In terms of number of articles, next after the
journals from Brazil are those from Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Cuba
and Argentina. The journals from the rest of the region
represent only 8.7% of the articles.
