The cognitive change family was the most prominent, suggesting that
teachers often reinterpret events or their own ability to deal
with them to minimize the impact of adverse circumstances and
reduce emotional work (e.g., AKBARI et al., 2016; BURIĆ et
al., 2016; TAXER; GROSS, 2018). Cognitive change takes several forms
(MALLORY; RUPP, 2016). For example, teachers strive to positively reinterpret
undesirable circumstances, such as students' demotivation and inappropriate behavior. For
instance, they try to perceive unmotivated students' efforts at doing
better at school (SUTTON, 2004; YIN, 2016). In addition, they
try to blame the external context (socioeconomic, cultural, the educational
system, etc.) or the attributes of the students (personality, age,
etc.) - the attribution of external causality (BURIĆ et al.,
2016). They also try to put the situation in perspective
to understand and accept it - putting themselves in the
other's place (AKBARI et al., 2016; CLARÀ, 2017; TAXER; GROSS,
2018). Other forms of cognitive change involve personalization, adjustment of
expectations, rationalization, and self-blame (Table 2).
