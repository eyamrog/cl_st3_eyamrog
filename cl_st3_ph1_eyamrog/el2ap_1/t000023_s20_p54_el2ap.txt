Note: Cosmarium pseudoconnatum is very similar to Cosmarium connatum Brébisson
ex Ralfs differing only in the presence of four chloroplasts
in each semicell, whereas the latter has two. According to
Scott & Grönblad (1957), cell wall of both species is
identical: scrobiculate with easy visible pores in between scrobicules.
