Despite there being many approaches to analyse discursive data and
interaction, it might be argued that all of them assume
that the researcher must “reflect on them [data] repeatedly and
at length, to be able to fragment and manipulate them
in the search for underlying patterns and meanings” (Evans, 2013,
p. 158). The extension in which the data is fragmented
may define the use of quantitative or qualitative methods. It
is considered that when analysing discursive interaction, in most cases
there is a moment in which the researcher will categorise
or ‘code’ an utterance, turn of speech or episode (Hennessy
et al., 2020).
