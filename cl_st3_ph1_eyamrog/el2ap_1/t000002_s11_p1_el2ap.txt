There is a usual view that relates methodology with the
selection of methods (techniques) for a study and their application
for data analysis. However, a far more comprehensive notion of
methodology comprises the researcherâ€™s attachment to different epistemological and theoretical
traditions that influence not only the selection of methods, but
also the framing of research questions and design (Mercer et
al., 2004; Taber, 2012, 2013; Treagust et al., 2014).
