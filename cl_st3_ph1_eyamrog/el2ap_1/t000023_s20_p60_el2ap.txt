Note: Present variety differs from the typical in having relatively
shorter cells, about as long as broad (West & West
1908). Two different phenotypic expressions of Cosmarium rectangulare var. hexagonum
were detected during the present study. Some individual specimens had
smaller length:width ratio and retuse apex, similar to the type
illustrated in West & West (1908), and a single specimen
was longer than the others and had a very wide
and truncate apex.
