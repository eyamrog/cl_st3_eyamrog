The University of Colorado Denver librarian Jeffrey Beall’s designation of
“potential, possible, or probable predatory scholarly OA publisher[s],” for which
he began to keep a list in 2008, has played
an outsize role in the discounting of Global South journals.
While we have addressed this issue in some detail elsewhere
(Khanna & Willinsky, in press), suffice it to state here
that that there are two prominent lists of so-called “predatory”
journals: Beall managed his publicly available list until 2017, at
which time Cabells began to offer its subscription service Predatory
Reports.17 Beall’s 2017 list contains 366 JUOJS (1.4% of the
JUOJS), while Cabells’ Predatory Report has 237 (1.0), with the
two lists sharing 82 JUOJS in common.
