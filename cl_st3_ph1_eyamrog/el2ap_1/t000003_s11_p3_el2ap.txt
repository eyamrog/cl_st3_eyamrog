For most of the twentieth century, the dominant concern in
the sociolinguistics of multilingualism was with the mapping of patterns
of language use in local ‘communities’ – communities that were
constructed as stable, homogeneous and bounded entities. Pratt (1987, p.
60) was the first to call for a de-centering of
the notion of “community” and for a move towards a
“linguistics of contact”. She argued that such research would focus
on “modes and zones of contact between dominant and dominated
groups, between persons of different and multiple identities, speakers of
different languages”.
