Various well-organized linguistic documentation projects, led by Brazilian linguists, are
ongoing and are producing significant amounts of recordings, steadily increasing
the need for professional archiving. For example, the Documentation Center
of the Federal University of Amap√° in Oiapoque has documentation
projects with the Karipuna and Galibi-Marworno (coordinated by Gelsama Mara
Ferreira do Santos) and with the Palikur (coordinated by Elissandra
Barros da Silva). Data is currently being stored on microcomputers
and external hard drives. The project with the Galibi-Marworno has
13.5 GB of audio (.wav) and 403 GB of video
(.mov, mp4), as well as 51 GB of photos and
15 GB of edited video. The Palikur project has 20GB
of audio, 6TB of video (.mp4) and over 100,000 photographs
in RAW format, for a total of 10TB.
