In addition, our results with lianas show that the fracture
toughness of leaf laminas increases with drying, similar to that
found in grass leaves in previous studies (Niklas 1992, Vincent
1990b, 1983). Indeed, as the leaves dry out, they become
more brittle, i.e., more notch sensitive. For example, at 10%
moisture content, the leaf fracture toughness of A. crucigerum is
on average 280 Jm-2. In contrast, at 50% moisture content,
the fracture toughness is on average 200 Jm-2, reducing 30%
in fracture toughness. Detailed analysis of the effect of leaf
dehydration on fracture toughness has been carried out for relatively
few species (grasses: Vincent 1983, 1990b), and, therefore, we have
expanded this approach to liana leaves.
