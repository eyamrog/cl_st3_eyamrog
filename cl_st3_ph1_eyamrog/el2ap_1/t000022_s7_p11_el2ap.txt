The construction of this integrated database faced significant limitations. The
principal one was, as has already been pointed out, the
lack of a common identification system amongst the indexing platforms
for authors, journals and institutional affiliations. There was no information
on gender, as is usually the case with scientific documents
and bibliographic records. An important difficulty was compiling the diverse
portions of the indexed published documents in the journals pertaining
to both indexing services.
