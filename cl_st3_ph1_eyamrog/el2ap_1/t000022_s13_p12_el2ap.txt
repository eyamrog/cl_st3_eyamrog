Let us now look at the distribution of the publishing
institutions according to their editorial management and financing models. We
found five types of publishers in SciELO and Redalyc journals:
1) universities; 2) scientific societies, professional associations, independent research centers,
national academies, and professional councils; 3) governmental agencies (ministry departments,
museums, and publicly managed hospitals); 4) commercial publishers (here we
bring together small and medium size national and local specialized
publishers), and finally; 5) the big publishers. The latter refers
to Reed-Elsevier, Wiley-Blackwell, Springer and Taylor & Francis, considered as
oligopolistic commercial publishers since they concentrated between 50% and 70%
of the world’s scientific production up to 2013 (Lariviére, Haustein
y Mongeon 2015).
