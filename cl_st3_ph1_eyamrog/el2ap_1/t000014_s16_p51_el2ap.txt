The documentation of Paresi was initiated at the request of
the Rio Formoso community, who were interested in recording their
traditional culture. In the EN Halataikwa community, we also got
in touch with a speaker of the language who invited
us to visit them and present the project proposal to
them. We obtained permission from the communities to record material
within a non-profit model. Communities benefited from the production of
DVDs, CDs and USB drives for accessing traditional stories and
songs, and from the training of indigenous teachers in linguistic
documentation. The Paresi material also served as a basis for
the elaboration of a reference grammar of the language, which
was defended as a doctoral thesis (BRAND√ÉO, 2014).
