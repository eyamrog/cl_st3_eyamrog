The first major outward movement of Timorese came in the
wake of the Indonesian invasion and occupation of the eastern
region of the island of Timor, in 19751. Individuals and
whole families moved abroad, as refugees, with the assistance of
the International Red Cross, to build a new and more
tranquil life in another country. Most moved to Australia or
Portugal. During this period, other Timorese took refuge in countries
such as Mozambique which had also been colonised by Portugal.
Later on, in the 1990s, during the final phase of
the struggle against the Indonesian occupation, a significant number of
Timorese students sought refuge in foreign embassies in Jakarta, Indonesia,
as a consequence of student-led demonstrations in Timor and in
Indonesia (FERNANDES, 2011). Most of these students eventually made their
way to Portugal, where they received financial support for several
years to continue their studies. Some of these students then
found their way to the UK as migrant workers.
