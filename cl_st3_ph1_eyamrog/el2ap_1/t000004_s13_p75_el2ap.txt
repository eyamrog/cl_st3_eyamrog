On some occasions verbal communication intrudes on the smooth flow
of movement, typically as repair. On one occasion, Sophie performs
a kick which she believes has hit Mestre João. She
apologises (verbally and through a gesture – a common-place gesture
rather than one specific for capoeira), then offers him her
hand in an invitation to perform a volta ao mundo,
after which they crouch at the pé do berimbau to
start a new game.
