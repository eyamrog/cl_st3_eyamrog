This work aims to evaluate the simultaneous relocation of the
bromeliads A. distichantha and W. cyathiformis rescued from the region
impacted by road work construction to a nearby Montane Dense
Ombrophilous Forest area, to mitigate the effect of deforestation. Those
species were selected as the most abundant in the deforested
area. This study can contribute to mitigate the impact caused
by deforestation, allowing the conservation of native species and the
maintenance of genetic diversity. It provides knowledge on the development
of low-cost techniques that will speed and enhance the success
rate of colonization for Bromeliaceae.
