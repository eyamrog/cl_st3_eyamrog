Seed collection and benefiting - We harvested fresh, mature, black
fruits directly from 15 matrices of Copernicia alba Morong from
a natural population at the Carandazal trail (Fig 1a), located
in a natural area of the Miranda subregion of the
Pantanal wetland, in Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil (GPS
coordinates 19º48’30.1’’S and 57º10’13.5’’W) in July 2011. The black exocarp
was considered the criterion of maturation for fruit harvesting. Harvesting
involved cutting the outer branches and dislodging the fresh fruit
bunches with a tree pruner, and then fruits fell freely
on the plastic wrap placed on the ground. We took
the fruits to the Seed Laboratory at Universidade Federal do
Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, where the experiments
were carried out. The exocarp and mesocarp of the fruits
were removed by manual friction; then, the pyrenes were inspected
for fungal infection and insect attack. All seeds were mixed
in a lot. Mature fruit is a dry, fibrous drupe
with an ovoid shape and black color, which consists of
an exocarp, a fibrous mesocarp, and a stony endocarp that
encloses the seeds, called pyrenes with 1-2 cm in length
(Figure 1 b-d). Since a thick (rigid) endocarp surrounded the
seeds, we used the whole pyrenes as germination units in
our study. The initial moisture content of the pyrenes was
determined by fresh-weighing two samples of 15 pyrenes and then
re-weighing the samples after oven-drying at 105 ± 3°C for
24h, according to the Brazilian rules for seed testing (Brasil
2009). After benefiting and initial assessment of moisture content, a
sublot of cleaned pyrenes were placed in a paper bag
and stored in a dry cold room at 19°C (45
± 5% relative humidity) for one year to evaluate viability
through germination test after the storage period.
