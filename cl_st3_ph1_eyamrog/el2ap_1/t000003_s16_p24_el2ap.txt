The Young Crocs team was organised for Timorese boys, aged
14-19, who were growing up in Northern Ireland, speaking Irish
English. The name of their team signified their new orientation
to English. However, the reference to young crocodiles in the
name of their club indexed Timorese-ness, since the image of
a crocodile is often evoked in Timor-Leste because the shape
of the island of Timor is said to resemble that
of a crocodile. The name of FC Tahi Calu had
multiple associations, including gendered ones: Literally, it means male sea:
This name makes a geographical reference to the South East
of Timor-Leste, where the tides are known to be stronger.
It also has a masculine connotation since, in Fataluku (as
in Tetum), a calm sea is described metaphorically as female
sea; while a rough sea is described as a male
sea.
