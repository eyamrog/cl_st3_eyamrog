We started this paper with the metaphor of “language learning
in the wild”. But is capoeira really “in the wild”?
We see it springing up historically as a space of
freedom and resistance on the periphery to the repressive norms
of a slave-owning society. However as soon as you look
at capoeira as practice you see how highly patterned and
organized it is. Every movement is regulated by the rhythm.
The songs and sayings are richly layered with cultural significances
that might not be immediately available even to some Brazilians.
The whole, as Sandro pointed out, is informed by the
fundamentos: cultural values that characterize capoeira practice, Historically one of
the insights of anthropology and sociology has been to uncover
the logics of practice, so activities that seem to the
outsider chaotic and can be dismissed as “primitive” are found
to have sophisticated order. This is clearly the case with
capoeira. Thus there is of course, despite its reputation, nothing
wild about capoeira: practitioners are apprenticed into, adhere to and
embody complex and layered logics of practice with a history.
Therefore, we believe that systematised language learning understood, following Agha,
as processes of enregisterment can be introduced in diasporic capoeira
classes, and capoeira can be enlisted to enrich language and
culture learning in mainstream Portuguese programmes. From our perspective Capoeira
as an Additional Language is not just about language, but
about acquiring a register that is organized as an assemblage,
comprised of its verbal, visual and embodied elements. Thus the
process that novice capoeiristas embark on is a process of
enregisterment.
