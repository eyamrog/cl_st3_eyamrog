In line with Yin's findings (2016), teachers reported genuine displays
of negative emotion in the face of inappropriate student behavior.
These emotional expressions were grouped into emotional authenticity and impulsive
reaction (acting out). Emotional authenticity refers to the emotional expression
that is more adjusted to the context, related to lesser
intensity events (for example, cell phone misuse and side-talking). However,
there was disagreement about the appropriateness of this display. While
some teachers reported being open to moderate expression to regulate
student behavior (CHANG; DAVES, 2009; YIN, 2016), others considered it
inappropriate to the ethics the function of teaching (BURIÄ† et
al., 2016; SUTTON, 2004). Interestingly, those who reported emotional authenticity
rated themselves as more effective and well connected with students
(SUTTON, 2004; TAXER; FRENZEL, 2015). It seems that exhibiting authentic
emotions, congruent with the demands of the situation, helps the
teacher influence the student's behavior (hetero-regulation) by bringing them together
(SUTTON, 2004; YIN, 2016). Thus, authenticity can be an effective
form of emotional work in this context (ASHFORTH; HUMPHREY, 2013;
TAXER; FRENZEL, 2015; YIN, 2016).
