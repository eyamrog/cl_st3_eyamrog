Copernicia alba Morong is a palm tree (Arecaceae family) native
to tropical and subtropical ecosystems in South America, occurring in
the Chacos of Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia, and the Pantanal in
Brazil (Lorenzi et al. 2004). This species is commonly named
“carandá” or caranday palm, often forming monodominant populations in the
Pantanal wetland, which is periodically subjected to flooding followed by
dry periods (Pott & Pott 1994). These areas can remain
flooded for up to eight months per year (Pott &
Pott 1994, Nunes-da-Cunha & Junk 2011, Figure 1 a). In
the natural areas, C. alba exhibits early successional characteristics, can
tolerate fires, and its fruit provide food for wildlife such
as macaws, parrots, and fishes (Pott & Pott 1994). The
economic relevance of C. alba regards its wood durability and
its uses in rural constructions such as corrals and fences
(Lorenzi et al. 2004, Pivetta et al. 2011).
