EAP has been successfully implemented to the teaching of academic
discourse, to both native and non-native students. Once it focuses
on the specialized language that students need to produce in
the academic environment, it usually becomes a requirement for scholars
so they can be prepared for academic communication. The problem
is that in many countries, such as the U.S., EAP
has been seen as a service subservient discipline, whose sole
aim is to prepare students to communication across the curriculum
or in academia (Benesch, 2001). In order to fight against
this underrepresentation, the critical perspective of EAP (CEAP) aims at
putting into the forefront the complexity of language teaching and
learning in the university, evidencing the potentialities of EAP pedagogy
to promote studentsâ€™ social awareness rather than just developing their
linguistic skills.
