Today’s motto – as frequently voiced by archivists – is
“Archive early and archive often!”. Many language archives recommend progressive
or incremental archiving. Under this model, a researcher or research
team submits primary data (e.g., audio and video recordings and
photographs), always accompanied by the relevant metadata (such as names
of participants, date, location, languages used, and descriptive information to
contextualize why the media files were created), to a digital
repository as soon as possible after the media files are
created (see step 1 in Figure 3 below). Secondary data
(e.g., annotations, transcriptions, interlinear glossed texts) and analyses or academic
output (steps 2 and 3, respectively, in Figure 3) are
added later after they are finalized (ROBINSON, 2006; NATHAN, 2013;
KUNG et al., 2020). In Figure 3, the steps represent
waves of archiving. Step 1, which involves archiving the primary
data and relevant metadata, should be done as soon as
the fieldwork or data collection phase is complete, or even
while fieldwork or data collection are still in progress. Step
2, archiving the secondary data and relevant metadata, can be
done iteratively as the transcriptions and translations are finalized. Step
3, archiving finalized analyses and academic output, along with relevant
metadata, can also be done iteratively and well into the
future. This approach recognizes that, for most researchers, or anyone
else, there will never be a truly convenient time to
archive language documentation data. The more time that passes and
the more digital files and physical materials that accumulate between
data collection and archiving, the harder and less convenient the
archiving process will be, and the longer it will take.
Moreover, since everything is fresh in a researcher’s mind immediately
after a period of fieldwork or data collection, it is
much easier at that point to organize materials accurately and
to make sure that the metadata are thorough.7
