The groups of children were chosen according to the tombola
procedure: first, all groups of children were named (institution, number
of children, age) and placed in three boxes, which functioned
as tombolaâ€™s (Grup 1: children 46 and 58 months old;
Grup 2: children 60 and 70 months old; Grup 3:
children between 72 and 82 months old); then two groups
were chosen by age in a lottery to obtain the
sample with 100 or more children. The Ministry of Education
of the province approved the study that responds to the
project "Stimulation of neurodevelopment in early childhood" of the University
of Cienfuegos, Faculty of Education. Inclusion criteria for the participating
children: (1) between 46 and 82 months of age, (2)
typical development for their chronological age, and (3) medium socioeconomic
level (families where the father and mother receive a salary
between 2100 and 4000 Cuban pesos. The parents' consent and
the children's agreement to participate in the study were ethical
documents to carry out the research. The characterization of the
sample is shown in Table 1.
