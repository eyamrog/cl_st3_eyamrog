The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric
properties of the PreAcademic Battery, revised version (B-PREA-R) for Cuban
preschool children. The battery was administered to 300 children between
four and six years of age in Cienfuegos, Cuba. Item
analysis showed that, out of 199 items, 61 items were
of high quality, 132 items of good quality and 6
items of regulate quality. Cronbach's alpha showed adequate values, Î±=
.85. Factor analysis revealed three factors. Factor 1, "Executive Skills,"
comprised of the subtests visual selective attention, matrices, story comprehension,
graphomotor skills, and quantity counting. Factor 2, "Memory Skills", which
groups the visual working memory subtest. Factor 3, "Linguistic Skills",
made up of the vocabulary, verbal working memory and repeating
syllables subtests. The selection of quartiles for the three age
groups (4, 5 and 6 years) allows us to make
a judgment about the development of executive, linguistic and memory
skills of preschool children. The B-PREA-R is a quick and
easy test to apply in the educational context and presents
adequate psychometric properties to evaluate the neurocognitive development in the
preschool stage, to discover the child's potentialities and weaknesses and
to guide his or her preparation to start basic schooling.
