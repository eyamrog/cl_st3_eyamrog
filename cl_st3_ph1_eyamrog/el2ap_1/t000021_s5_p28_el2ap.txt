In summary, the findings are congruent with research that suggests
that negative emotions, genuine or regulated, are present in daily
classroom work and mark the emotional lives of teachers (e.g.,
BAHIA et al., 2013; TAXER; FRENZEL, 2015). It also corroborates
the model by Fried et al. (2015) that considers the
teachers' emotions as intrapersonal, interpersonal, and contextual due to the
specificities of the occupation. Furthermore, it is suggested that negative
emotions are often the target of regulation given their counter-hedonic,
counterproductive, and disruptive potential in the context investigated (e.g., ENGLISH
et al., 2017; TAXER; FRENZEL, 2015).
