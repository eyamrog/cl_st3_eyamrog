In order to ensure the integration of DICT into the
teaching-learning processes, which are also the basis of the current
distance education processes, it is necessary to consider, at least,
the issues of equipment and internet ownership, at school and
at home. The issue of having sufficient knowledge to handle
study tasks in addition to readings and videos, that is,
thinking about the production of activities in digital mode, as
well as the ability to share them is also something
important to be considered. In this way, the student, in
fact, can continue the study process wherever he is, including
completing homework assignments. There are other dimensions such as emotional,
family and financial aspects that deeply affect a student's studies,
which demonstrates that the flexibility of the integration of DICT,
even when it culminates in possibilities for distance study, does
not guarantee academic success (Costa & Santos, 2017; Costa et
al., 2020). However, here in this text focus will be
maintained on such aspects as the physical conditions of possession
and acquiring knowledge of technology, both in public spaces and
homes, to construct satisfactory situations for education and study with
and via DICT.
