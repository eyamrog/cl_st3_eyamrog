The techniques employed in the field for obtaining information were
standard, adjusted only to the particular requirements of the information
being gathered. A journal was kept; temperature, humidity and precipitation
readings were recorded daily in camp; information obtained from observation
and interrogation were accumulated on four-by-six slips or some other
convenient form – in duplicate, with date, place and informant’s
name indicated on each slip; specimens, photographs, and tape recordings
were taken of everything possible.
