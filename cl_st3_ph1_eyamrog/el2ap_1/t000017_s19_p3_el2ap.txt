The study applied factor analysis using the maximum likelihood method
with quartimax rotation, however, the method showed three factors with
47.61% of the common variance, which does not meet the
assumption of Cuadras (2016), when it indicates that the adequacy
of the factor analysis should explain the common variance greater
than or equal to 60%.
