This study aimed to characterize the emotional labor of the
professional and technological education teacher by examining the emotions and
the emotion regulation strategies adopted by teachers. Eight focus groups
were held, with the participation of forty-one teachers in total,
to collect the data. For the data analysis, we adopted
the inductive and deductive categorization methods. The results showed that
different emotions are activated in the face of specific emotional
demands and that teachers use a variety of strategies, either
in isolation or in chains, to regulate them. However, cognitive
change strategies and situation modification of the procedural model of
emotional regulation were more frequently reported. The results suggest differences
in the regulatory preferences of the teachers based on the
career period and the training /performance area. Future research could
use varied methods (e.g., observation diary) to investigate regulation's dynamic
and contextual process and its outcomes and propose a contextual
scale of teacher emotional regulation. The findings have implications for
teacher training programs, educational management, and future research.
