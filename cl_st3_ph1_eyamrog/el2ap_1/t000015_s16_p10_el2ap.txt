While the research hegemony of English is present among the
JUOJS, another linguistic feature of this collection is that 48.3%
publish in more than one language (Figure 7). The relationship
among the four leading languages can be tracked among mono-
and multi-lingual journals (Figure 8). While monolingual English language journals
represent the largest segment at 6,651 titles (indicated in by
single dot under the first column), the notable bibliodiversity among
the JUOJS appears in the next column with Indonesian-English bilingual
journals with 4,431 titles, and Portuguese-Spanish-English trilingual journals with 550
titles. It is also worth noting that the use of
English may be overestimated, as it is common for titles
and abstracts, on which the language analysis relies, to be
translated from other languages into English. As well, articles do,
on occasion, employ multiple languages in their text, for example,
Spanish and Castilian, or Bahasa Indonesia and Javanese.
