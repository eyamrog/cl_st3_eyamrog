Plant harvesting - After deforested, adult individuals (60 specimes) of
both species living had lived on tree branches and soil
were harvested at random by fieldworkers, taking care to cause
the least possible mechanical damage in the root system. The
collected plants were mixed and randomly transplanted into pots, not
considering whether they had been taken from trunks or from
the ground. The rescues were conducted by the research group
of Instituto de Botânica of São Paulo State, Brazil. In
sequence, they were cultivated in Pinus composted bark substrate and
maintained in a nursery covered with a high-density polyethylene black
shade cloth with 50% of shading for half to one
year until relocation (figures 3 a-b).
