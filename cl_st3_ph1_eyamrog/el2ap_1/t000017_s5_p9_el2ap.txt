On the other hand, the tendency of the battery is
to group tasks related to the child's language and memory
development. In the case of language development, three subtests were
used to assess the child's semantic and phonological skills, such
as vocabulary, verbal working memory and syllable repetition. With respect
to memory, the battery groups a third factor named working
memory skills, where the characteristics of the task make possible
the affirmation of the factor among the other subtests of
the B-PREA-R.
