Two species plus two species with hybrid origin are currently
recognized (Thomson 2012, Zhou et al. 2014, Schwartsburd et al.
2018, 2020). In addition, a total of ca. 20 morpho-taxa
are also recognized as infra-specific entities, such as subspecies, varieties,
forms, or combinations of more than one rank (e.g., Tryon
1941, Page 1976, Thomson 2012, Schwartsburd et al. 2018). In
Brazil, the following taxa are currently recognized: Pteridium caudatum (L.)
Maxon, P. esculentum subsp. arachnoideum, P. esculentum subsp. campestre (Schrad.)
Schwartsb. & J. Prado, P. esculentum subsp. gryphus Schwartsb., P.
esculentum var. harpianum Schwartsb. & A. Ya√±ez, and P. esculentum
var. paedomorficum Schwartsb. & J. Prado (Schwartsburd 2020). The most
common taxon in southeastern Brazil is P. esculentum subsp. arachnoideum,
which invades crops and is toxic for cattle, horses, and
human ingestion (Schwartsburd et al. 2018).
