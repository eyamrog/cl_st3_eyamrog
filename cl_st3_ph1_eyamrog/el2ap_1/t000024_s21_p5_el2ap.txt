Furthermore, it is noted that in W. cyathiformis (table 4),
the number of leaves of bromeliads transplanted as terricolous or
epiphytic did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) in different
observed periods. This shows that the number of leaves does
not depend on the form of relocation, as also noted
for A. distichantha. However, the number of leaves of W.
cyathiformis decreased significantly (p > 0.05) from 252 days onwards
and remained constant until the end of the experiment. This
behavior probably shows those bromeliads could have an abiotic water
and nutritional stress when relocated.
