On the other hand, a new generation of indexes, such
as Dimensions and OpenAlex, do much better. They cover 54.3%
and 63.8% of the JUOJS respectively, by relying on automated
aggregation of open resources (such as Microsoft Academic Graph, Crossref,
Unpaywall, DOAJ, ORCID, and PubMed). Finally, 88.3% of the JUOJS
are indexed in Google Scholar. This is a result, in
good part, of its lead engineer Anurag Acharya reaching out
repeatedly to PKP, beginning in 2004, to improve its indexing
of JUOJS through improvements on both sides. This suggests the
deliberate effort needed to start to overcome the legacy of
“the large periphery,” as Cetto put it.
