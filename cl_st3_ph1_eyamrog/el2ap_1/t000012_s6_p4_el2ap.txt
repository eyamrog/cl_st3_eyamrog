Here, we have analyzed the structure of interactions and the
natural history of bird species in facultative interactions, aiming to
unravel the complexity of bird-mammal cleaning communities. Although the history
of resources consumed and the centrality degree are important to
comprehend the patterns of interactions, each one of them plays
a different role in the composition of the community. In
a broader perspective, these results suggest that the factors that
may allow species to participate in ecological community networks are
not the same factors that modulate their role in the
same networks. Other factors, such as species abundance, can determine
degree centrality. Thus, the role of species does not depend
on a global structural generalism. But specifically, the role of
species depends on their natural history and their integration into
different types of interactions.
