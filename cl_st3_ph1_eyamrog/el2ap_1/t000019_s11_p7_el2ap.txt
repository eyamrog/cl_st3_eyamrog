In Brazil, the pedagogical discourse based on technology is predominantly
instrumental and deterministic (Peixoto & Ara√∫jo, 2012). In this line,
the instrumental vision of ICT in education is understood only
as a didactic resource, under the command of human action.
Deterministic philosophy, on the other hand, believes in technological supremacy,
placing it as the salvation of educational problems. According to
these two trends, when things are not going well in
school education, it is either because the teacher does not
know how to use technologies or because the school has
not adopted them in a structural way, which would transform
education. These perspectives, in addition to blaming only a human
dimension, do not take into account the social issues of
students and their families, frees public authorities from the responsibility
of their roles and do not seek to explain the
reasons for the choices made in schools.
