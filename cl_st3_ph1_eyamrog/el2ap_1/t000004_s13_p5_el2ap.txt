It was in these conditions that capoeira emerged. It is
believed to have developed in the North-eastern state of Bahia,
which was the centre of the sugar-based economy, and where
the capital city, Salvador da Bahia, was located. The exact
time and circumstances of capoeiraâ€™s origins are much disputed. The
earliest mentions of capoeira date back to the 19th century
and they have the form of chronicle articles, notices from
foreign visitors to Brazil, newspaper articles as well as one
engraving, possibly capturing the practice of capoeira (DE ABREU, 2005).
