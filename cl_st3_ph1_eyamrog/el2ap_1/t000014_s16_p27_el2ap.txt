Nevertheless, Rosés Labrada sensed that the concept of archiving remained
“fuzzy”, particularly in two areas: (1) the implications of the
online sharing of materials that identify specific individuals and (2)
the options for sharing or restricting access to those materials
or the names of the individuals. Thus, the linguist took
steps to make sure that the community really understood what
was involved in the archiving process. His goal was to
show them what the collection in the archive would look
like, but the challenge came from the lack of Internet
access in the community.
