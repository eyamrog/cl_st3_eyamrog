People were arriving at different times for Sandro’s classes; Sandro
himself was often late as he was commuting from York.
For this reason, there was often a considerable amount of
time before the actual beginning of the class. When the
students meet before the class, they greet each other warmly,
usually with a hug and a kiss on the cheek.
This reflects the fact that some of them had known
each other for years – however, newcomers receive a warm
welcome as well. The same can be said about the
workshops, where the greetings may be warmer as the students
may see each other after a long time.
