While the ~5 kbp rRNA operon is the longest repeat
in many bacterial genomes, longer repeats are possible. For example,
Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155 contains a 56 kbp duplication in its
chromosome40. In such cases, typical ONT read lengths (~20 kbp)
can be insufficient for assembly and ultra-long reads (~100 kbp)
are needed (Figure 2C).
