In the first documents with curricular guidelines, at national level,
in Brazil (Brasil, 1997; 1998), instrumental and deterministic trends of

guided Brazilian basic education until 2017, when the final version
of the National Common Curricular Base (BNCC) was published (Brasil,
2017), and is a document currently in force.
