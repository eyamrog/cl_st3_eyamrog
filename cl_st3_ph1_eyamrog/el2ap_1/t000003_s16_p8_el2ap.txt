All members of the core group had had some modest
material resources when taking the decision to move north. They
had had enough to cover the cost of the long-haul
flight from Timor-Leste to Europe and their living expenses while
seeking employment. Take, for example, MFB who had worked in
an Indonesian bank during the Indonesian occupation (1975-1999) and, then,
after Independence in 2002, he had worked with a non-governmental
organisation (Interview with MFB, June 2015). CX had been a
male nurse who had worked for Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)
during the three-year UN administration6 (1999-2002) and had then gone
on to work for the national health service in Timor-Leste
after Independence (Interview with CX, June 2015). DA had been
a driver for a government department after Independence (Interview with
DA, June 2015). And AX had been employed as a
porter in a warehouse in Dili (carrying sacks of rice)
and also as a construction worker.
