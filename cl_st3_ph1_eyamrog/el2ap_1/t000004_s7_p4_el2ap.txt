The notion of assemblage helps to consider how diverse semiotic
resources play a collaborative role as a spatial repertoire in
accounting for the success of this activity, when language is
not predefined as the sole, superior, or separate medium of
consideration. Assemblage corrects the orientation to non-verbal resources in scholars
addressing ‘multimodality’. From the perspective of assemblage, semiotic resources are
not organized into separate modes. (CANAGARAJAH, 2018, p. 39)
