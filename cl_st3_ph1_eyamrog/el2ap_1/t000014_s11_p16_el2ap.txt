Finally, a trustworthy digital repository has an active plan for
the long-term digital preservation of the digital media files and
associated metadata. According to the Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC), digital
preservation "[r]efers to the series of managed activities necessary to
ensure continued access to digital materials for as long as
necessary. [...] [It] refers to all of the actions required
to maintain access to digital materials beyond the limits of
media failure or technological and organizational change.” Long-term preservation is
the "continued access to digital materials, or at least to
the information contained in them, indefinitely” (DPC, 2015). This means
that digital preservation is much more than just backing up
files. Digital preservation work includes migrating data and metadata from
one format to another and from one software system to
another as technology changes. It means ensuring accurate redundancy of
data (meaning that there are duplicate copies stored on various
media types and in multiple locations); and it means monitoring
the health of all of the files in all of
the locations on a regular basis. According to Owens (2018,
p. 5), “preservation is the result of ongoing work of
people and commitments of resources. The work is never finished
[…] It is not something that can be thought of
as a one-time cost.”
