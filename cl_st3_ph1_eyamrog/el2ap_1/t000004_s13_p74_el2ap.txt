Although there may be differences between styles, capoeira is played
at a relatively short distance. The two players are very
close to each other, however they hardly ever touch. Instead,
they avoid each otherâ€™s attacks, while at the same time
looking to put themselves in an advantageous position from where
they could perform an attack themselves. Most of the times,
the attacks are deliberately unfinished.
