Note: This variety differs from the typical by having thinner
cell wall, a more open sinus, and the relatively broader
cell (Krieger & Gerloff 1962). Specimens in the population currently
studied showed a wider range of its length:width ratio, whereas
according to Krieger & Gerloff (1962) that of the present
variety is about 1.25 times longer than broad.
