Note: This variety showed a considerable morphological plasticity, mainly in
their length:width ratio and lateral margins shape. Bicudo (1988) discussed
the polymorphism in Cosmarium abbreviatum var. minus and its consequences
for the taxonomic identification of such small desmids, suggesting the
great probability of many taxa, among which Cosmarium succisum G.S.West
var. jaoi Willi Krieger & Gerloff and C. abbreviatum var.
minus, might just be morphological expressions of the one same
species. Present material displayed the same morphological variation described in
the above-cited literature.
