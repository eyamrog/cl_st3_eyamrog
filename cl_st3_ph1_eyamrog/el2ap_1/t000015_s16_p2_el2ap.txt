A journalâ€™s country of origin of a journal through a
three step process. First, we used the ISSN (International Standard
Serial Number) of a journal to query the LOC ISSN
lookup API for location, which provides us with a MARC
code. This MARC code can then be mapped to a
country (Raoni, 2021). MARC codes that map to within-country regions
or states are handled manually to reflect corresponding countries. Second,
we extract the top level domains from the journal URLs
and map them to their corresponding ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country
codes. Third, we geolocated the IP address of the journal
host using a weekly updated copy of the GeoLite2 Free
Geolocation Data.10
