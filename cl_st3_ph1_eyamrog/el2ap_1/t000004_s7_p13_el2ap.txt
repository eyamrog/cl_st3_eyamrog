Sandro: I was all the time getting beaten from children
at the school, and the reason erm one day I
was selling ice-cream on the streets on the trolley and
I saw some guys playing on, just, the neighbourhood, just
the small park, just kicking around, doing some back flips,
doing some cartwheels, and I asked what that was and
they said, “oh this is capoeira”. “But who is the
teacher?” “Oh, there are no teacher, we just get together
here, so a person who knows a little bit more
help teach each other.” Erm, it was the only group
of people who actually helped me without judging me for
who I was, you know. (Interview with Sandro - audio
