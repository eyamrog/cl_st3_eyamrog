Anyone who has ever had to copy field recordings from
an obsolete medium (e.g., cassette tapes) to another format, tried
to open an old file in a new version of
the program, or endeavored to find a program that can
even open the old file, understands the headaches involved in
format migration.3 However, researchers who archive language documentation materials in
a digital repository never need to worry about format migration
again because it is part of the archival workflows that
are overseen by the archive's personnel.
