Participants reported numerous emotions triggered by the investigated emotional demands
(Table 1). Although they also cited positive emotions, the focus
of the study was on negative ones. The most mentioned
and important ones were anger, frustration, helplessness, and sadness. Interactional
demands such as inappropriate behavior, perceived lack of support, and
over-bureaucracy primarily trigger emotions such as anger, frustration, fear, and
anger. On the other hand, technical-pedagogical demands such as demotivation,
learning disability, classroom management, diversity, and academic indiscipline seem to
trigger more frustration, worry, compassion, impotence, and anguish, especially for
the first two demands. In short, interactional demands seem to
trigger the most intense and difficult negative emotions to regulate.
