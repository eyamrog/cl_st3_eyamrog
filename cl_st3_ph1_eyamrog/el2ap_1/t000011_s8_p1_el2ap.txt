Plants deal with different environmental pressures, resisting damage, stress and
maintaining structural support along their entire life span. The damage
resistance and structural support of stems and leaves of woody
plants can be biomechanically evaluated by their stiffness, bending and
toughness (Niklas 1992, Speck 1994, Rowe & Speck 1996, Speck
& Rowe 1999, Niklas et al. 2006, Rowe et al.
2005). Interestingly, biomechanical properties have also been focus of studies
cross-evaluating possible associations between animal’s feeding behavior and the biomechanical
properties of the specific plant parts these animals consume. The
physical properties of leaves and stems were shown to be
related to the primate’s masticatory structure (Strait 1997), and ultimately,
suggested to be coevolving in animals and plants (Thiery et
al. 2017). In those studies, the biomechanical properties of plant
structures are measured by mechanical tests. For example, structural Young’s
modulus measures the relation of bending stiffness by the sample’s
geometrical property of area (Niklas 1992). On the other hand,
toughness is the material’s or plant tissue resistance to fracture,
corresponding to the energy required to fracture an object. In
this case, the area under a stress-strain diagram provides the
measure of a material’s toughness in terms of the work
done per unit volume (Vincent 1992, Niklas 1992). These properties
depend on the composition, shape, and hydric status of the
material (Niklas 1992, Vincent 1990a). Although mechanical properties are well
known for homogeneous materials, such as plastic or iron, the
same is not true for the heterogeneous biological materials, such
as plant structures.
