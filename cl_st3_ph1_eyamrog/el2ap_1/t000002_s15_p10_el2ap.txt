The utterances that are related to the task content were
classified regarding their discursive functions inspired in the IRF pattern
and based on the dialogic features that describe productive talk
(Howe et al., 2019). Thus, it was generated created six
codes, two for each move of the triadic discourse: invitation
(INV), dialogic invitation (D_INV), contribution (CON), dialogic contribution (D_CON), follow-up
(FOL) and dialogic evaluation (D_EVA). This distinction was made only
for content utterances because they are the medium in which
knowledge construction and conceptual learning happen.
