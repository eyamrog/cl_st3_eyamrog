The relationship between actual language teaching and learning (LTL) and
theories of language learning, has always been an interesting one.
So called structural approaches were informed by Bloomfieldian structural linguistic
and behavioural theory. This paradigm was dramatically overturned by Chomsky’s
mentalism and its emphasis on the mind of the learner,
which has pervaded research on LTL for a number of
decades. Emergent in the last two decades or so has
been a sociolinguistically informed turn considering language learning as contextual.
Key moments include The Classroom and Beyond (WAGNER, 2004) as
well as The Social Turn in SLA (BLOCK, 2003). As
well as contextualizing the language learning process and developing a
richer and more nuanced account of the learner, these approaches
have drawn on developing areas such as pragmatic and discourse
analysis, also on both language learning and culture learning. The
focus on “authentic language” and attempts to define this for
classroom purposes is an example of an issue provoked by
such considerations of context. Arising out of these concerns more
recently have been calls to “bring the outside in” to
classroom learning (ROBERTS; BAYNHAM, 2006) along with approaches that go
further and advocate taking language learning out of the classroom
and into “the wild” (ESKILDSEN; THEODÓRSDOTTIR, 2015).
