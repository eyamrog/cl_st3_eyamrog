Gesture and ritual play an important part in the communication
ensemble of capoeira. In the roda, communication through gestures plays
a key role. Gestures are used to mark a transition
from one thing to another (such as when starting or
finishing the game) or they serve to show respect to
the leader and other participants of the roda. Some of
the gestures follow an established pattern and they resemble a
ritual, believed to have origins in the Afro-Brazilian religion of
candomblé. The connection with religion is also reflected in some
terminology (bênção – lit. blessing; a name of a kick;
batizado – lit. baptism; a grading ceremony).
