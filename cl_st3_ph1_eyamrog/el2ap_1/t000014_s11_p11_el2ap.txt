Archiving also facilitates personal organization. Shortly after returning from the
field, most researchers still remember where all of the files
they created are located and how they are organized. However,
as time passes, memory fades, and it becomes much harder
to remember where files are, how they are organized, how
they relate to each other, and the relevant metadata (i.e.,
contextual information) that will allow for their future reuse, either
by the researcher who created them or by others. The
situation is amplified for digital files, which cannot easily be
distinguished and, thus, will need to be viewed or opened
to be identified. The solution is to archive language documentation
data, as well as the associated metadata, as soon as
possible after they are created. Once the data and metadata
are archived in a trustworthy repository, they can always be
found and accessed again. Researchers no longer need to remember
where files are stored (e.g., on which external hard drive,
laptop, or cloud storage system), and they no longer need
to juggle the work of handling multiple copies and backups
of the data. Archiving helps to ensure that the data
and metadata are not lost, thrown out, or forgotten about.
