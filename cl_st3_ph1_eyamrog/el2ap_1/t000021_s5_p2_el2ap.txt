Teachers use a wide variety of emotional regulation strategies to
primarily avoid or reduce negative emotions before, during, and after
class. These results are similar to ones found by Burić
et al. (2016) and Taxer and Gross (2018). The strategies
identified were appropriately grouped into the five families of the
Process Model of Emotion Regulation, suggesting that this model serves
the classroom context well and is consistent with previous studies
(e.g., AKBARI et al., 2017; BURIĆ et al., 2016; SUTTON,
2004; TAXER; GROSS, 2018). The families of cognitive change and
situation modification were the most salient, which is similar to
the findings by Burić et al. (2016). Sutton (2004) also
found the prevalence of cognitive change. However, authors such as
Taxer and Gross (2018) found that teachers are more likely
to use response modulation (e.g., suppression), whereas Akbari et al.
(2017) highlighted the use of situation selection. These divergent findings
point to disagreements in the literature about how teachers regulate
their emotions in the classroom.
