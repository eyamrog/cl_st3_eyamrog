Practising in pairs typically follows the practice of individual movements,
and it can be seen as a step between the
exercises performed individually and the actual game in the roda.
Unlike in a real game in the roda, however, practising
in pairs is an opportunity to learn and practise the
moves, leaving space for discussion between the two students. The
exercises in pairs are usually synchronized and practised at a
close distance, therefore coordination and communication are essential for the
successful performance of the sequence. The students use both spoken
language and body movement (language/body translanguaging) to communicate to each
other. Spoken communication is likely to be significant especially when
beginners are involved, whereas when Tiago is paired with another
advanced student, they train mostly in silence.
