In 2018, Philip G. Altbach and Hans de Wit, two
leading scholars of higher education at Boston College, published “Too
Much Academic Research Is Being Published” in University World News.
In making their case, Altbach and de Wit point out
that although “no one knows how many scientific journals there
are... several estimates point to around 30,000” (2018).1 Finding the
number excessive, they declare “a crisis in academic publishing” involving
“too much pressure on top journals” and “the rise of
predatory journals and publishers that publish low or marginal quality
research.” They recommend steps be taken to reduce the amount
of research published.2 The analysis in this article not only
challenges such journal estimates but calls for a recognition of
the Global South’s research commitment and engagement. The source of
this analysis is 25,671 journals that are using the open
source editorial management and publishing platform Open Journals Systems (OJS),
first released by the Public Knowledge Project (PKP) in 2002.3
