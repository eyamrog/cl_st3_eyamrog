Porto et al., (2021) showed the importance of language in
parents and its influence on the neuropsychological development of the
child. According to these authors, the educational level of the
parents is a good measure to expect a good development
in the child and differentiate from other infants with different
condition. Certainly, it is an accurate position and although it
was not the objective of the present research, in Cuba,
7 out of 10 adults are professionals according to the
last population CENSUS. Therefore, this condition may not be the
ideal one to justify the differences between the Cienfuegos and
Santi Sp√≠ritus groups; however, it should be reviewed, since sometimes
highly educated or professional parents are very busy and share
their child's education with other non- professionals (caregivers).
