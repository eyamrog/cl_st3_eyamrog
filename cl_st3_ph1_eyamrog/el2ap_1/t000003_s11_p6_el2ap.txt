As the mobility paradigm has been developed in sociolinguistics, and
across the social sciences, there has however been growing divergence
of views. In one strand of work (e.g. CRESSWELL, 2002,
BRENNER, 2004, HANNAM et al., 2006, URRY, 2007), there has
been a critique of research where there is an exclusive
focus on mobility and of “deterritorialized approaches that posit a
new ‘grand narrative’ of mobility, fluidity or liquidity as a
pervasive condition of postmodernity or globalization” (HANNAM et al., 2006,
p. 5). These scholars have argued that an account of
mobilities is incomplete without reference to moorings and reterritorializations. They
argue that “forms of detachment or ‘deterritorialization’…are always accompanied by
rhizomic attachments and reterritorializations of various kinds” (HANNAM et al.,
2006, p. 3).
