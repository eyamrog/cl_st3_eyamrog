The sociocultural approach offers an important theoretical framework for assessing
and stimulating the development of preschool children in the educational
context, which is complemented by cognitive neuropsychology in the child
population, which typically studies the relationships between the brain (maturation
of brain structures) and the behaviors of developing children. A
review of the literature allows us to observe a tendency
of researchers to develop and adapt cognitive tests in preschool
children with an integrated approach, in which the expertise of
cognitive neuropsychology is brought together with the foundations of the
sociocultural approach (Piedra et al., 2021).
