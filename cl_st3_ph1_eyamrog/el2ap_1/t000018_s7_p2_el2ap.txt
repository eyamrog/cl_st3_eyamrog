With respect to evaluation, it is important to highlight that
it is a topic that is being updated, both in
Cuba and in other regions of Latin America. (10,11) Several
authors from the region(10-14) , emphasize the need to review
the topic in preschool children, as it shows its importance
in directing the child's educational process and preparing him/her for
the next school stage. Likewise, they state that evaluation in
the educational process of preschool children is a reflective, systematic
and rigorous process of inquiry for decision making.
