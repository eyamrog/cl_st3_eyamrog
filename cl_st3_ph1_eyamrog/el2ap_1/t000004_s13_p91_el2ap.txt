These rituals may be interpreted in connection with candombl√©, but
many capoeiristas interpret them more broadly as a way of
acknowledging the authority of the leader of the roda and
showing respect towards each other. For Tiago, these gestures capture
the spirit of respectfulness and non-competitiveness in capoeira.
