From this perspective, the way of analyzing activity (neuropsychological factors)
and the use of the evaluative methods proposed by Luria
can be used in preschool education. Psychological sciences use Luria's
theory as a basis for the evaluation of the child
with neurodevelopmental disorders, and in this sense, the use of
neuropsychological factors is essential to explain the maturation of brain
regions involved in the mental development of the child. However,
the science of education uses the contents of neuropsychological factors
to analyze the conceptual, attitudinal and procedural contents in preschool
childhood, which are pedagogical foundations in that education, and allow
directing the educational process with a comprehensive approach.
