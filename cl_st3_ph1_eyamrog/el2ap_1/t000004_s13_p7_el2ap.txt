Following a period of illegality in the first half of
the 20th century as a result of capoeira being used
for fighting between street gangs known as maltas (PORTAL CAPOEIRA,
2022a), capoeira has undergone a transformation to become one of
the symbols of Brazilian identity. Today capoeira enjoys a great
popularity across Brazil as well as globally and we can
find a capoeira school in every major European city.
