(Water immersion and one-year storage influence germination of the pyrenes
of Copernicia alba Morong, a palm tree from a neotropical
wetland). Palm seeds are known for displaying dormancy and a
thick endocarp that delays germination and embryo growth; but water
treatments may accelerate their germination process. Additionally, ex-situ conservation can
cause seed viability loss over time. Data on seed dormancy
and storage have been neglected for many native palm species
in Brazil. We investigated the effect of water treatments and
one-year storage on the germination of Copernicia alba Morong, a
palm tree from the Brazilian Pantanal wetland. To address our
aim, fresh and stored pyrenes were immersed in water (at
room temperature for 24, 48, and 72h) and in hot
water (~75Â°C for 5- and 10-min). Fresh pyrenes germinated up
to 84% in control, reaching 100% after water immersion for
48 and 72h. In contrast, one-year storage reduced germination by
almost 50%, but water immersion slightly increased the germination of
stored pyrenes. On the contrary, hot water decreased germination for
both fresh and stored pyrenes. Seeds of C. alba may
be classified as orthodox seed storage behavior. Taken all together,
water treatments at room temperature improved the germination of the
pyrenes. In contrast, long-term seed storage and hot-water treatments may
jeopardize germination.
