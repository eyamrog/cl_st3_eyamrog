The necessary conditions are insufficient, both in public schools and
in households in classes D and E, which are those
who attend this type of school. Most Brazilian public schools
do not have human or technological resources to support the
development of teaching permeated by ICT, either in person or
at a distance. In reality, what can be done, and
has been done even during the pandemic period, amounts only
to the delivery of materials sent by different messaging applications.
Then, students do the tasks and return them using the
same devices. There has been no distance education, as it
is not possible under these conditions. Thus, the discourse of
flexibility and advantages of distance studies, of using devices in
general, has been used to convince people, but, in practice,
there has been no online education guided by interaction and
integral training, as shown by authors (Costa & Lib√¢neo, 2018),
since before the pandemic.
