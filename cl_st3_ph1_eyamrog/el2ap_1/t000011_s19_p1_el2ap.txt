Anatomical structure - The stems are slender (average = 8.4
mm Â±SD1.35) and cylindrical (figure 1a) in Amphilophium curcigerum (L.)
L.G.Lohmann (Bignoniaceae). These stems have a cambial variant known as
xylem interrupted by phloem wedges (figure 1b). The secondary xylem
has wide vessels and broad rays that can be easily
noticed in macroscopic transverse section (figure 1b). The leaves are
slightly asymmetrical, with cordiform shape, venation pinnately and leaf mesophyll
is dorsiventral with two layers of palisade parenchyma and about
three layers of lacunose parenchyma (figures 1c-d).
