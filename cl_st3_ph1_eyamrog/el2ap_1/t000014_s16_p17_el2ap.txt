Whatever the affiliation of the person or people who lead
a documentation and archiving initiative, they work under an ethical
imperative to clearly communicate, explain, and obtain consent for these
efforts from the speakers and other community members involved. Below,
we explore these ethical requisites and offer some strategies to
meet them (§4.1), illustrated via a case study from co-author
Rosés Labrada’s work with the Mako people of Venezuela (§4.2).
At the end of this section (§4.3), we consider strategies
for enabling community access to archival materials.
