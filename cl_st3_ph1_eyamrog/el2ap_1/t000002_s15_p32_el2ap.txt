No clear, straightforward distinction exists between the sequences of exploring
and guiding explanations as real classroom interactions have unplanned utterances,
deviations, and uncontrolled flows that make it hard to frame
the sequences under a single category (Barnes, 1976). Thus, these
kinds of explanatory sequences should not be taken as neat
or crystalline; different categories overlap in some utterances. Mercer (1995)
already raised this concern when he proposed the three kinds
of group talk.
