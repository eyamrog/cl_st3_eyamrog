This paper is based on research of a sociolinguistic and
ethnographic nature, which was carried out with young migrants from
Timor-Leste, who were based in a small town in Northern
Ireland (CABRAL; MARTIN-JONES, 2017). Through this research we traced their
migration trajectories (via Portugal or England), and we documented the
agentive ways in which they were dealing with local conditions
of settlement and employment, and, at the same time, creating
new spaces of solidarity and conviviality within local life worlds.
We focus here on one particular life world – that
of sport – and on the nine football clubs formed
for Timorese men and boys in this local Irish setting.
We describe and analyse three different aspects of the communicative
practices that were developing around the football: (1.) The linguistic,
cultural and semiotic practices involved in the naming and branding
of the clubs e.g., practices that indexed different Timorese identities
(from different regions of Timor-Leste) and practices that indexed different
globalised cultural worlds of football; (2.) the language resources of
the Timorese club managers (including Tetum, Portuguese and English), and
their organisational practices, their ethos and their funds of knowledge;
(3.) the significance of the scheduling of football tournaments around
key dates in the establishment of the nation of Timor-Leste
– a regular practice that indexed an orientation to a
shared national origin.
