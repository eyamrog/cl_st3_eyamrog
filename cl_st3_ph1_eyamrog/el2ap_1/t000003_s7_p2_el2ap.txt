In this paper, we focus on one particular life world:
that of sport and, in particular, the nine football clubs
that had been formed for men and boys, in this
small-town context. We describe and analyse three different aspects of
the social, cultural and semiotic practices that were developing around
the football: (1.) The linguistic, cultural and semiotic practices involved
in the naming and branding of the clubs – practices
that indexed different Timorese identities (from different regions of Timor-Leste)
and practices that indexed different globalised cultural worlds of football;
(2.) the language resources of the Timorese club managers (including
Tetum, Portuguese and English), and their organisational practices, their ethos
and their funds of knowledge; (3.) the significance of the
scheduling of the football tournaments around key dates in the
establishment of the nation of Timor-Leste – a regular practice
that indexed an orientation to a shared national origin.
