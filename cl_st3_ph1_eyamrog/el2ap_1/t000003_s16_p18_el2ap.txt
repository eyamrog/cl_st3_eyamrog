Two local employment agencies act as the gatekeepers for those
seeking work. Whilst the Timorese who arrived in the first
groups found work right away, and even had their passage
from Portugal paid for (Interview with RS and HA, June
2015), those who have arrived in recent years have found
that it takes about 5-8 months to get a full
time position. There has also been increasing casualization of employment
so, initially, newcomers are offered part- time work on an
ad hoc basis. Describing the insecurity and the anxiety experienced
by him and his colleagues, over an eight-month period, due
to the precarity of their situation, one of our interviewees
gave the following account: “Ne’ebé telefone ami tau deit iha
ulun leten …kualkér tempu deit [sira] liga ona” (We slept
with our phones above our heads …they could call us
at any time) (Interview with CX, June 2015). For those
Timorese who do receive a full-time position, the working hours
are long. They work twelve-hour shifts, but overtime is no
longer paid, since the pattern now alternates each week. They
work for 5 days one week and just 2 days
the following week.
