Scarce neuropsychological research in the child population has shown that
children's performance can vary significantly by cultural, educational and socioeconomic
effects; in particular, the few results have revealed differences in
cognitive and socioemotional development in preschoolers (Lohndorf, et al., 2019).
However, Porto et al. (2021), Rea- Sandin and Causadias (2021)
specify that the variability is more significant in executive functions
due to the effect of the parents' educational level.
