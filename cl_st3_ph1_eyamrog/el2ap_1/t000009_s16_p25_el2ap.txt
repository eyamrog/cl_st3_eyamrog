In this respect, data in Figure 3 also show huge
discrepancies among participants located in different countries/regions concerning their perception
of contextual issues that might influence the publication process of
computer science high-impact journals. “Having co- authorship with a well-known
researcher in the field” was perceived as a big influence
on the process by 75% of Brazilians located in the
South of the country, and half of the participants in
the South and the Northeast believed that the level of
the researchers’ degrees influences their papers’ acceptance. Four of the
five contextual factors investigated were considered influential to the publication
process by the interviewees located in the Southeast, whereas just
a few participants who were then abroad considered only two
factors.
