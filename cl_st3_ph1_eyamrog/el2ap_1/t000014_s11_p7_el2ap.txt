Fortunately, there are many institutions around the world that have
made the commitment required to maintain digital archives. The Digital
Endangered Languages and Musics Archives Network (DELAMAN, https://www.delaman.org/), is a
network of member archives that specialize in language documentation data.
Some of these archives are only digital, while others have
physical holdings as well. Some specialize in a specific area
of the world (e.g., the Archive of the Indigenous Languages
of Latin America, AILLA, has a regional focus indicated in
its title), others will accept material from anywhere in the
world (e.g., the California Language Archive, CLA). Some archives will
accept only data associated with a particular grant or funder
(e.g., the Endangered Languages Archive, ELAR, mainly accepts materials collected
with grants from the Endangered Languages Documentation Programme), while others
primarily accept materials in or about a specific language (e.g.,
Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Language and Culture Institute). As part
of the generalized increase in awareness of the endangered state
of the majority of the world's languages, several Latin American
institutions, including in Brazil, also committed to hosting local language
archives; see Seifart et al. (2008) for an in-depth discussion
of the early stages of this process. Unfortunately, many of
these archives have not stood the test of time. Two
repositories in Brazil, however, have continued to operate and are
discussed here in §3. Other archives have also been created
more recently, such as the Archivo de Lenguas, Culturas y
Memorias Históricas del Ecuador, which has institutional support from FLACSO
Ecuador (http://languages.flacso.edu.ec/).2
