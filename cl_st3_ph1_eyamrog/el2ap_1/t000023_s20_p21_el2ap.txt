Note: The present species has a feature not usually observed
in Cosmarium difficile Lütkemüller, i.e., a refractive thickening at the
apex of the semicells. The only representative of C. difficile
having such apical thickening is C. difficile f. laeve Scott
& Prescott, however, this forma does not have the typical
pore rows of the species. Thus, it was decided that
the current material would be best identified as C. difficile,
mainly due to the typical punctuation rows despite of the
originally non-described feature.
