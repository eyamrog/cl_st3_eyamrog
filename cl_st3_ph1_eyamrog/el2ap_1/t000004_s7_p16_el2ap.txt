When he moves to the country his new elderly mestre,
while continuing to train him in the street fighting aspect
of capoeira, also immerses him in the history and culture
of capoeira, the songs, the stories, the characters, the African
influences. This aspect is also very important in his practice
as a contramestre. In his introductory sessions in Leeds he
painstakingly explains in English the deep meaning and historical significance
of the old songs and stories (cf. the “snake story”
below). Interestingly, he doesn’t particularly endorse a simple idea of
Portuguese for capoeira, capoeira for learning Portuguese. For Sandro capoeira
is something multilingual, with influences from Yoruba and Crioulo and
beyond, not just Portuguese, in a way he is advocating
the translanguaging perspective we adopt here.
