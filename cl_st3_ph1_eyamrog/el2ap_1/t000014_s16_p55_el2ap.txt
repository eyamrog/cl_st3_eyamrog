The secondary data produced in these projects include annotations and
metadata associated with the recordings. Annotations, consisting of transcriptions and
translations into Portuguese, were made using the ELAN program (EUDICO
Linguistic Annotator 2020) and Word. Lexicons for both languages were
also developed, and several Paresi texts were interlinearized using the
FLEx program (FieldWorks Language Explorer 2019) according to the analysis
presented in the reference grammar. The transcriptions and translations of
the texts were made by the speakers. Most of the
transcriptions were produced during the period when the lead researcher
was not in the communities and, in the case of
Paresi, they were later reviewed with the speakers. Paresi speakers
received training in the use of ELAN, while EN speakers
had little interaction with this program and preferred to transcribe
in Word using a computer or cell phone. We are
still organizing the notes from the EN recordings, such that
all material will be transferred to ELAN and can later
be published in a digital collection.
