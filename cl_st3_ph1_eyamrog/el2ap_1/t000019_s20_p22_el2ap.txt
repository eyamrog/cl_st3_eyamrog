Ownership of computers in Brazilian households reached 56% in the
years prior to 2016 but is currently below 40% in
the homes of public school students (CGI.br, 2018, 2019a). It
is observed that, from 2011 to 2019, the increased possibility
to own cell phones implied the abandonment of having computers.
This is possibly due to the need to choose between
one and the other, and the cell phone is preferred
due to the lower price, its communicative functions and its
easier mobility. Thus, it is noted that the use of
the Internet has only increased via cell phones, as the
number of computers per household, public telecenters and computer labs
active in schools has decreased.
