As this article has explored, archiving is an essential component
of language documentation. It is only through archiving, and via
well-maintained digital repositories with adequate infrastructure and institutional commitment, that
documentary materials are reliably preserved and made accessible for the
long term. Fortunately, the number of robust documentation projects and
archival collections has been growing rapidly in the last few
decades, as exemplified by the Paresi and Enawene Nawe projects
described in the final section of this article (see also
MOORE and GALUCIO, 2016). But we must build our participation
and investment in archiving if we are to maintain the
outcomes of this documentary work. As we discuss here, this
means contributing to, supporting, and expanding archiving initiatives on all
levels â€“ regional and national initiatives like the Museu Goeldi
in Brazil, and archives with international scope such as AILLA.
It also means supporting and expanding the possibilities for speaker
and heritage communities to access these materials, both through, by,
and in collaboration with archives. As linguists, we have a
social and academic responsibility to archive the documentary materials that
we produce, to support initiatives to archive legacy materials, to
make materials as accessible as possible, and to work closely
with communities to ensure an ethical process.
