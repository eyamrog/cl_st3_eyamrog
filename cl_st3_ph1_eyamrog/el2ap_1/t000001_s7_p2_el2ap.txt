The solution to this problem is de novo assembly: the
computational process of reconstructing a genome from sequencing reads. There
are two broad goals to consider with genome assembly: accuracy
and completeness. Accuracy refers to the number of errors present
in the assembled sequences (contigs). Such errors can be small
in scale (e.g. an incorrect base) or larger in scale
(e.g. the addition/removal of hundreds of bases). Completeness refers to
the length of the contigs relative to the corresponding genomic
sequence, i.e. how fragmented the assembly is. Longer contigs are
better, ideally each contig representing an entire replicon in the
genome. We define a ‘perfect’ assembly as one which maximises
both accuracy and completeness. A perfect assembly of a bacterial
genome would contain one complete and error-free contig per replicon
and no additional contigs.
