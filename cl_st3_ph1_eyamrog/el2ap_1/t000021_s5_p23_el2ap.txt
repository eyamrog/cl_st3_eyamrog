Although similar empirical studies have not been identified, it has
been inferred that teachers in the basic area seem to
have greater awareness and emotional repertoire based on other research.
This seems to help face the demands in a more
purposeful and result-oriented manner (GROSS, 2014 ). Castejón, Cantero, and
Pérez (2010) support this finding, affirming that professionals with training
in the technology area pay less attention to emotions than
professionals from other areas such as social sciences, education, and
humanities, for example.
