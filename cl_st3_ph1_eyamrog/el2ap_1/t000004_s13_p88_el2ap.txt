In addition to regular trainings, the capoeira workshops are delivered
by visiting mestres, usually coming either directly from Brazil or
another country where they have moved to from Brazil, often
with the purpose of teaching capoeira. In either case, they
may not speak English or their English may be limited,
so here Portuguese is likely to be the main language
of communication. At the two workshops we have observed, the
mestres communicated with the students mostly in Portuguese and Sandro
interpreted some of their speech into English. As a rule,
lot of socializing is taking place at the end of
the workshop, and Portuguese language is often used for informal
communication.
