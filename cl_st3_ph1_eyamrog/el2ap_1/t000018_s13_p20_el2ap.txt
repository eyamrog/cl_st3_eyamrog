- a specialist in neuropsychology, and based on Luria's theory,
recognizes the actions of man to analyze the psychophysiology of
the activity; however, the educator can also observe the actions
of the child, although to assess his or her integral
development. In other words, a specialist using neuropsychology observes a
child's drawing to analyze neuropsychological factors and issue a criterion
on the maturation of brain regions involved (36) , while
the educator observes the drawing to analyze motor skills, the
relationship with objects, the child's personal involvement with what he/she
draws, the values and habits that can be reflected in
the drawing, concentration and compliance with the objectives set by
the educator.
