Overall, water treatments positively influenced germination. The freshly harvested pyrenes
reached 100% of germination after immersion in water for 48
and 72h (Figure 2 a). Stored pyrenes germinated 32% after
soaking in water for 24h but reached ~50% after 48
and 72h (Figure 2 b). The water treatments for 48
and 72h also improved MGT of freshly harvested pyrenes (to
around 20 days) compared to the control (25 days, Figure
2 c), thus providing faster germination. In contrast, there was
no change in the mean germination time of stored pyrenes
among treatments (Figure 2 d). Hence, water immersion for two-to-three
days improves the germination of freshly harvested pyrenes of C.
alba, which may accelerate germination and seedling growth for nursery
production. The number of germinated seeds per day was improved
by water immersion, as indicated by the speed index after
48 and 72h, mostly for the freshly harvested pyrenes (Figure
2 e). Water immersion pretreatments also promoted germination of Butia
capitata (Mart.) Becc. pyrenes (Arecaceae) from the Cerrado (Soares et
al.2021); and seed of Copernicia prunifera (Mill.) H.E. Moore (carnauba)
from the Brazilian Northeast region (Reis et al. 2011) that
seems to display flood-tolerant seedlings (Arruda & Calbo 2004). Both
species occur in flooded environments, suggesting that the enhancement of
germination ability after immersion in water can improve the competitive
performance following flooding events in their natural habitats.
