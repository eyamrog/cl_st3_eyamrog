The above-described method requires human judgement and interaction, particularly at
the Trycycler and short-read polishing steps. This allows users to
catch unexpected results, ensuring that poor data does not proceed
to the next step. This method is appropriate where accuracy
is paramount (e.g. reference genome assembly), but it cannot be
run in an automated manner (e.g. with Nextflow35) and is
thus not suitable for high-throughput assembly.
