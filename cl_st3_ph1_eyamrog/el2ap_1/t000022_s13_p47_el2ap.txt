Another point to highlight is that the nine states analyzed
exhibit similar percentages in each of the types of collaboration.
The observed variations in the table are not pronounced, which
suggests that these are relatively stable features of the Brazilian
scientific production space. To support this conclusion, we look at
a region that is very different from that of the
Northeast. Table 7 shows the collaboration of the five most
productive states. The main feature here is the degree of
in-state collaboration which is more pronounced with respect to the
case of the Northeast since in all cases it exceeds
50%. For each state in the table, the other four
states represent approximately the same proportion of collaboration (fourth column
as all the remaining states in Brazil (fifth column). Clearly,
the concentration in collaboration in the institutions of these five
states stands out. But it is also clear that, even
though it is smaller, their collaboration with states less prominent
in the Brazilian scientific sphere is not totally marginal. Finally,
it is worth noting the remarkable similarity in the profiles
of the five states in Table 7, which might be
suggesting – as mentioned before – consistent trends in this
field of collaboration.
