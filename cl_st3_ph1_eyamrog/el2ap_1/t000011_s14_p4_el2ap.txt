We calculated the fracture toughness of leaves lamina using the
Lucas Scientific FLS-1 portable mechanical tester (FLS-1, São Paulo, Brazil),
based on a standard scissors test in which the sample
is put placed between the blades of a pair of
scissors (Lucas & Pereira 1990, Lucas et al. 2001). Every
4 hours, a new flat portion of the center of
the leaf lamina, parallel and between secondary veins, was excised
with a razor blade. Leaf lamina strips of 2.5 mm
long and 1.5 mm wide were mounted perpendicularly between the
blades of a pair of scissors attached to the equipment
for mechanical tests. The crosshead of the tester drives the
blade handle down with the load monitored at the same
point to cut, in the leaf section, over a given
displacement (work is done - Wc). In sequence, the scissors
are returned to their original position, and the leaf sample
is removed. The scissors are driven down again over the
same displacement, and we recorded the work done against friction
between the blades themselves (frictional work - Wf), which is
termed “empty pass.” The work frictional in the empty pass
is deduced from the work done with the leaf sample,
which gives fracture work. In the tests reported here, the
scissor blades are cleaned before the test to remove any
trace of the previous test. Lastly, we measure the cut
length (L; mm) and its thickness of the leaf lamina
sample (t; mm) using a sensitive dial caliper, and the
cleaved area was calculated as the product of the leaf
thickness and the length of the slit. The fracture toughness
(R; J m-2) of each leaf lamina sample was calculated
as the work of fracture divided by the area cleaved,
using the formula [R = (Wc - Wf) / Lt].
