Results: 70 publications were selected from 796 records retrieved from
databases. The studies mainly included non-systematic reviews and case studies
with only six clinical trials. According to the narrative synthesis,
twenty therapies were identified, including the use of wound dressings
(58.6%), analgesic drugs (55.7%), topical antimicrobials (25.7%), skin barriers (15.7%),
cryotherapy (5.7%), and Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (4.3%). Therapies were
recommended to be applied to the wound bed or the
periwound skin. In 68.5% of the studies, a standardized assessment
for pain was not described.
