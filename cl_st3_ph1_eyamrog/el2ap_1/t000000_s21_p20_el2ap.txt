One pantropical genus with about 24 species (Rojas-Alvarado 2010, Luong
et al. 2015, Schwartsburd 2020, Schwartsburd 2022). The adoption of
genus Orthiopteris for the Paleotropical species is phylogenetically justified, but
lacks morphological support; thus, regarding only Saccoloma in Saccolomataceae is
more convenient (Schwartsburd 2022). In Brazil, nine species are currently
recognized (Schwartsburd 2022).
