After Sandro arrives, he usually prepares the instruments (including the
strenuous process of stringing the berimbau) and classes start shortly
after. To mark the beginning of the class, Sandro usually
asks the students to get a chair and sit in
a circle, as a preparation for the “theoretical” part of
the class.
