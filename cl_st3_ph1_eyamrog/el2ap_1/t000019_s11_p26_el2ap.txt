According to the research, ICT Education 2018 (CGI.br, 2019b), young
peopleâ€™s ability to use the Internet is closely linked to
self-taught experiences. According to the study, 80% of students in
public and private schools in the country learned to use
the Internet by themselves, which indicates learning more focused on
basic common knowledge. Later, in the same research, it is
noted that "the available evidence points to the continuity of
inequalities between schools, both in terms of the use of
technologies and in the conditions of access of the population
to education in general". (CGI.br, 2019b, p. 116).
