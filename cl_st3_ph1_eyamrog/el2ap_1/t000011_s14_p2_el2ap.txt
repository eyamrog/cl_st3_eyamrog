Experimental design - Ten straight stem segment, approximately 20 cm
long and 5-10 mm in diameter, were selected for biomechanical
tests. Stem samples with a tapering percentage greater than 10
% were not considered (Rowe et al. 2005). Also, ten
mature sun leaves without herbivory marks or damage were sampled
in the same individual. All of them, stem, and leaf
samples, were initially weighed with a precision weighing balance and
tested as described below to obtain the structural Youngâ€™s modulus
and fracture toughness in time 0 (natural condition), respectively. To
investigate the role of the dehydration process on the biomechanical
properties of stems and leaves, we carried out a 48hours
experiment manipulating the hydric status of the samples. The stem
and leaf samples were randomly and evenly assigned to two
distinct hydric conditions: (i) samples kept moist in a tray
covered with wet tissue paper and (ii) samples undergoing dehydration
gradually with natural moisture loss to the air. During the
experiment, the samples were weighed every four hours and subjected
to biomechanical tests.
