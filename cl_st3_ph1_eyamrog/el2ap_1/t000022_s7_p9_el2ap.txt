Finally, we focus on the case of Brazil. Given the
significant weight of this country with 50% of the total
number of articles published in the database and having a
high tendency towards co-authorship among Brazilian authors, we contrast this
with a more detailed analysis of the SciELO Brazil collection
(only journals from Brazil). There we find that there is
a strong tendency towards scientific collaboration between authors affiliated with
the same country but belonging to universities from different states.
A picture thus emerges that calls into question the preconception
that collaboration between authors of the same country signifies academic
inbreeding and reveals the complexity of this national academic space
and its current dynamics.
