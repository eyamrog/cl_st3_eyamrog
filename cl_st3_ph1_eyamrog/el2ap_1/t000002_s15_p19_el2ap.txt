There are just three task-pairs that show significant differences (H(6)
= 24.881, p < .001); tasks 1-2 (p = .008),
tasks 2-6 (p = .001) and tasks 4-6 (p =
.04). In Figure 3, it can be seen that tasks
2 was the most dialogic, followed by task 4, while
tasks 1 and 6 showed moves with more non-dialogic utterances.
Therefore, the hypothesis of enhancing the use of dialogic utterances
throughout tasks was not confirmed. There were only a few
differences between tasks that cannot be classified as an effect
of the intervention.
