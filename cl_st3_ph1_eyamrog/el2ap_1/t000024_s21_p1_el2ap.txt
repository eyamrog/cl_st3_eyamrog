Survival of relocated specimens at each observation, and over time
- Relocation has been considered a method for plant conservation
in cases of forest removal for road works (Jasper et
al. 2005) and Barrancos et al. (2016) showed that transplanting
bromeliads can be a simple and non- destructive approach to
overcome the limitations of epiphyte dispersal and accelerate the recovery
of biodiversity. As shown in Table 1, specimens of A.
distichantha transplanted in the terricolous form did not present statistically
significant difference (p > 0.05) in the survival rate between
vegetative or reproductive stages of the entire observation period. When
the plants were relocated as terricolous or epiphytic in the
vegetative stage, presented 100% survival (table 1). Only when the
plants were relocated as epiphytes in the reproductive stage did
survival statistically decrease (83.33%) after 287 days from the beginning
of the experiment (100%) (table 1). Even so, the survival
rate could be considered high. The high percentage values are
probably since both bromeliads under nursery conditions in pots where
the plants are better nourished and with good phytosanitary conditions.
The survival percentages observed herein for A. distichantha were higher
than those in similar studies of relocated Aechmea species with
62,5% (Araújo 2006). In this work, this procedure was similar
to the usually performed in rescue procedures by companies’ workers,
in which A. distichantha plants are found in the natural
environment of the forest were randomly collected, and regardless of
whether they were epiphytic or terricolous.
