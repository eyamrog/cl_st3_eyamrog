Finally, we stress that legacy materials can be utilized on
an ongoing basis, and that usage requires interpretation – a
creative process of understanding of “what those materials meant to
their creators, what new meanings they might take on in
the context in which they are being used, and what
roles [contemporary actors] themselves as persons might play in the
materials’ circulation and reception” (DOBRIN and SCHWARTZ, 2021, p. 23).
One especially productive example of ongoing work with legacy materials
is the biennial Breath of Life Archival Institute for Indigenous
California Languages (see GEHR, 2013) held at the University of
California, Berkeley, organized by the Advocates for Indigenous California Language
Survival (AICLS) in conjunction with the Survey of California and
Other Indian Languages, which houses the California Language Archive. The
Institute brings indigenous people to the Berkeley campus to collaborate
with volunteer linguists in the interpretation of archival materials, many
of which date back to the early 20th century. This
model has been successfully expanded to other locales (BALDWIN, PÉREZ
BÁEZ and HINTON, 2018) and it may be fruitful to
consider whether a similar initiative in Brazil could increase the
accessibility of existing language materials.
