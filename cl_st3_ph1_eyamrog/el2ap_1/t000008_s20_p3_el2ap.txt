Regarding seed behavior storage, we suggest that C. alba Morong
seeds may be classified as desiccation-tolerant (orthodox) given their low
water content ranging from 10 to 7% and the moderate
germination percentages maintained after the storage period. Hong & Ellis
(1996) define as orthodox those seeds that tolerate desiccation ≤12%
moisture content and remain viable during 12 months of subsequent
storage. Nevertheless, the authors also pointed out that investigations of
seed survival in different storage environments, such as at lower
temperatures (-20°C), should be tested to confirm if the seeds
show intermediate rather than orthodox seed storage behavior. Recent research
has shown that some tropical species of the Arecaceae family
produce seeds that exhibits desiccation tolerance after storage (Orozco-Segovia et
al. 2003, Souza et al. 2016). In Cerrado ecosystems, the
seed of Acrocomia aculeata (Jacq.) Lodd. ex Mart. has been
identified as desiccation-tolerant and can be stored over one year
under low temperatures (10°C, see Ribeiro et al. 2012). Ex-situ
seed conservation is a worldwide concern (CBD 2010, Walters et
al. 2013); however, longevity patterns remain a matter of inquiry
for most tropical palm trees (Broschat 1994, Pivetta et al.
2011). The natural habitats where the study species occurs can
experience prolonged events of drought in pluriannual dry spells of
the Pantanal (Thielen et al. 2020), such as those that
occurred in 2020; therefore, the desiccation tolerance may play a
critical role in maintaining this species in the ecosystem under
a set of dry years. Nevertheless, low-temperature conservation and in
vitro culture propagation methods remain unstudied for seeds of C.
alba.
