Websites also facilitate content sharing, and code can be added
to make the pages discoverable by search engines. While limiting
access to content is possible, it can be a technically
challenging process. Traditional copyright automatically applies to websites, but the
website developer can choose to apply Rights Statements6 or open
licenses, such as those managed by Creative Commons, to the
webpages and/or the linked files.
