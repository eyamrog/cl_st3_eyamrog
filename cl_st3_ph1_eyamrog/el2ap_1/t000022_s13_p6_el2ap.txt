Accordingly, the evolution of the journals shows two significant increases,
one in 1998- 2000 and another in 2005, the years
when SciELO and Redalyc were launched. The journals published in
Brazil make a significant contribution because there is a jump
in the number of journals precisely in 1998. The curve
continues its upward trend, reaching 198 journals in 2004 and
324 in 2005. The curves of the other six countries
with significant publishing activity also show a similar trend, although
less pronounced than that of Brazil (Figure 2). The first
big increase occurs two years later, between 1999 and 2000
when SciELO began to more actively promote itself outside of
its country of origin (Brazil). For example, for Mexico there
are 23 journals in 1996 and 87 in 2000. The
most pronounced increase appears to be for the journals edited
in Colombia when, in the same period, the number of
journals goes from 4 to 35.
