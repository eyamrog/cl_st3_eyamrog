Amongst the journals with APC’s, 38% of them are managed
by scientific societies, 37% by universities, 13% by the major
commercial publishers, 7% by a governmental organization, and 5% by
small commercial publishers. The fact that many journals managed by
the academic community have sought to finance their operations through
the adoption of APC’s brings us to the question of
the sustainability of the journals and their varying degrees of
institutionalization. Córdoba González (2021) observes that Latin American journals with
APC’s have, by and large, low fees. This is also
noticed in the journals included in the OLIVA database, which
suggests that they are responding to the need to cover
the costs of editorial processes and the management of the
peer review process that are not funded by the institutions.
The journals indexed in SciELO and Redalyc have specific cataloging,
evaluation and digitization procedures which require material and human resources.
These are generally provided by the publishing institutions, but in
some cases they turn to the APC to pay for
the DOI, translations, or administrative or technical support. This cannot,
however, be equated to the business model of the commercial
journals. Furthermore, journals with high APC’s, similar to the levels
found in the mainstream industry, are exceptional in the region.
