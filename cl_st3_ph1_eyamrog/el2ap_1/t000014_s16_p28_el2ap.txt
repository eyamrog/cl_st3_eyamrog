The solution adopted was to take screenshots of an initial
archival deposit to show what the archive’s website looked like
and what it would be like to navigate through it.
In preparation, Rosés Labrada and one of the schoolteachers visited
the AILLA and ELAR websites while in Puerto Ayacucho, the
capital of Amazonas state, and the schoolteacher agreed to deposit
one of his recorded stories to start a collection that
was to be double-archived in both archives.11 After the deposit
of a folder with all the items corresponding to one
single story, both archives supplied screenshots of what the collection
and the deposit looked like.
