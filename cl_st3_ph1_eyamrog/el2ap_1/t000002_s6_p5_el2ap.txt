Although quantitative and qualitative methods have been contrasted, both methodologies
play play relevant roles and can be seen as complementary
(Snell & Lefstein, 2011). Systematic coding is a method for
managing an extensive data set, identification of general patterns across
multiple lessons /tasks while allowing statistical comparisons and developmental analysis
(Mercer et al., 2004). On the other hand, sociocultural discourse
analysis can explore fine-grained and offer a multi-dimensional understanding of
the complexities of classroom dialogue (Asterhan et al., 2020). While
the former constricts the discursive interactions into measured variables (positivist
ideal), the latter reveals the complexity and richness of the
discursive exchanges with greater interpretative vein.
