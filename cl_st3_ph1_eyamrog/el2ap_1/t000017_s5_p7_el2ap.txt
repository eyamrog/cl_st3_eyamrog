In the graphomotor subtest, a task similar to subtest 6
"visuoperception" in the Child Neuropsychological Maturity Questionnaire (CUMANIN) (Portellano et
al., 2000), the child is required to follow a graphic
model that demands the correct grip of the pencil with
his or her guiding hand, to make continuous strokes, to
follow the line of the stroke correctly, to draw in
the required space and to do so with the greatest
possible similarity, as well as to have adequate hand-eye-space coordination.
Some validation studies have shown that the visoperception subtest is
a nonverbal task, and is suitable for assessing the development
of executive functions in preschoolers (Parra et al., 2016; Avila,
2012).
