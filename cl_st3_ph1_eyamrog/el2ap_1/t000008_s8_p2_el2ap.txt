Studies have shown that ex-situ conservation of palm seeds has
been associated with seed viability loss over time (Broschat 1994,
Orozco-Segovia et al. 2003, Nascimento et al. 2010, Jacob &
Decruse 2015, Oliveira et al. 2015, Felix et al. 2017,
Beltrame et al. 2018, Bastos et al. 2021). Several external
factors influence the viability of tropical palm seeds during storage,
such as temperature and time, and intrinsic factors like seed
moisture content, seed maturation, and desiccation sensitivity (recalcitrance) (Roberts 1973,
Orozco-Segovia et al. 2003, Baskin & Baskin, 2014, Sano et
al. 2015). Recalcitrant seeds do not tolerate water loss -
typically below a threshold <12% - thus rapidly fading in
laboratory storage (Hong & Ellis 1996) and showing a low
potential for forming soil seed banks (Oliveira et al. 2015).
On the other hand, orthodox seed storage behavior can be
maintained ex situ over a long-term in suitable environments (Hong
& Ellis 1996). The longevity of stored palm seeds varies
among species, and the optimal conditions for ex-situ conservation may
reduce metabolic activity under relatively low values of environmental humidity
and temperatures (Pivetta et al. 2011). In laboratory conditions, temperatures
ranging from 18 to 23Â°C have been recommended for most
palm seeds (Broschat 1994) and tested for a few tropical
species, such as the macaw palm (Acrocomia aculeata (Jacq.) Lodd.
Mart.) from the Cerrado savannas (Ribeiro et al. 2012) and
Copernicia alba Morong from Brazilian wetlands (Masetto et al. 2012).
