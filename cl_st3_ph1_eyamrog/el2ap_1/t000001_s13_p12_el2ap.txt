Long-read polishing usually improves assembly accuracy, but a drop in
accuracy is sometimes possible. It can therefore be unclear at
this step whether the unpolished assembly, Medaka-polished assembly or some
alternative (e.g. Clair3-polished) is best. ALE is a tool which
quantifies the concordance between an assembly and a short-read set28,
allowing one to assess the relative accuracy of different assemblies.
We therefore recommend using ALE to guide the decision regarding
which version of the assembly should progress to the next
step (short-read polishing).
