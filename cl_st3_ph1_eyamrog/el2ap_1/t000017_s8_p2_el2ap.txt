During the last decades Luria's cultural neuropsychology has gained momentum
in the assessment and rehabilitation of preschool children (Solovieva &
Quintanar, 2021; Solovieva et al., 2019; Bonilla-SÃ¡nchez et al., 2019;
Cadavid-Ruiz et al., 2019). Such neuropsychology arises from Vygotsky's sociocultural
theory and is based on two principles: (1) child development
occurs in a sociocultural context and (2) the systemic structure
of mental processes. The first means that the child develops
through intersubjective activity during upbringing and teaching in a certain
social and cultural context. The second, in turn, means that
mental processes cannot be divided into isolated functions (attention, language,
memory, etc.), but rather it is an integral system (Solovieva
& Quintanar, 2021; Solovieva et al., 2019).
