More than 90% of the use of DICT by Brazilians
is related to everyday uses, usually restricted to communication by
instant messages and posting on social networks (CGI.br, 2019a). This
of course is linked to the use of cell phones,
and as such does not guarantee sufficient technical understanding for
the intellectual and integral development of individuals. It is essential
not to take access to cell phones as an indication
of growth and evolution in the mastering of IT, much
less considering the type of knowledge we have about their
functions.
