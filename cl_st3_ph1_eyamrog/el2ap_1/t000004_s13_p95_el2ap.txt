At other times, the players may break the attack-escape dynamic
by introducing a ritualistic sub-game such as chamada or volta
ao mundo, or even introduce dance or a small dramatic
performance. These moments favour playfulness and self-expression, however even a
seemingly harmless and friendly gesture may serve as a guise
for an attack. In fact, this ability to confuse the
adversary by pretending, this is malandragem, highly valued in capoeira.
