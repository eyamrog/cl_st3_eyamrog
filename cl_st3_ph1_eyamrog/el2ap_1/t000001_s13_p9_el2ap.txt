Several long-read assemblers have been developed that are suitable for
bacterial genomes, including Canu18, Flye19, NECAT20, NextDenovo21 and Raven22, each
of which uses different methods and thus has advantages/disadvantages. Regardless
of the assembler used, most long-read bacterial genome assemblies contain
avoidable errors, and given the same read set, different assemblers
are likely to produce assemblies with different errors23. Trycycler exploits
this fact by building a consensus from multiple alternative assemblies
of the same genome, allowing it to avoid structural errors,
remove spurious contigs and ensure that circular sequences have no
missing/duplicated bases at their ends5. We therefore recommend using Trycycler
to produce long-read bacterial genome assemblies. However, note that Trycycler
is not an automated tool â€“ it requires human judgement
and interaction.
