Community members may interact more or less directly with an
archive. An example of quite direct interaction can be seen
in the “Verdena Parker Collection of Hupa Sound Recordings and
Films” (PARKER, n.d., held by California Language Archive). Verdena Parker,
a native speaker of Hupa (Dene, aka Athabaskan; California), made
sound recordings and films over many decades, culminating in her
collaboration with linguists from the University of California, Berkeley on
a documentation project, initiated in 2005 (see PARKER et al.,
2005+). These recordings, archived in 2010, include texts, vocabulary, translations,
and observations about life in Hoopa Valley, for use in
revitalization programs.
