Language teaching and learning, as with any other social practice,
is a complex system, whose results depend on the interaction
of an array of elements (Larsen-Freeman, 1997). Subjects, target language,
language of instruction, studentsâ€™ native language, materials, tasks, assessing tools,
language and teaching theories, target discourse community, institutional and economic
constraints, and so on, are all elements involved in language
teaching and learning. Besides, each of them is also a
complex system that emerges out of the interaction of other
elements. Languages, for example, are the social, cultural, and ideological
result of the interaction of people and artifacts to communicate/act
in society.
