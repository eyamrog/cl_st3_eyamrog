Response modulation was the third most prominent family of regulation
strategies, suggesting that teachers try to change their emotion regulation
tendencies, even when it is impossible to avoid them (GROSS,
2015). It was related to extreme events, mainly with student's
inappropriate behavior (ENGLISH et al., 2017; SUTTON, 2004; TAXER; GROSS,
2018; YIN, 2016) and conflict with colleagues and superiors, perhaps
due to the perception of low control over these events
(BURIÄ† et al., 2016). Like other studies, teachers modulate their
emotions through suppression strategies, behavioral tactics, and social sharing (AKBARI
et al., 2016; SUTTON, 2004; TAXER; GROSS, 2018; YIN, 2016).
