Different paradigms can employ very contrasting aspects, most fundamentally when
considering the two broadest perspectives. The first paradigm is positivist,
nomothetic, and confirmatory, which means that it deals with definitive
and objective knowledge, seeks general patterns or laws, and tests
hypotheses. The underlying assumption is that “it is possible to
report unambiguous truth, in terms of observable phenomena and verified
facts” (Taber, 2013, p. 49). Guba and Lincoln (1994) pointed
out that this approach is grounded in realistic ontology and
objectivist epistemology. Realistic ontology entails that “an apprehendable reality is
assumed to exist, driven by immutable natural laws and mechanisms”
(p. 109), whereas an objectivist epistemology assumes that “the investigator
and the investigated ‘object’ are assumed to be independent entities,
and the investigator to be capable of studying the object
without influencing it or being influenced by it.” (p. 110).
This approach to social science is deemed objectivist and determinist
because it sees human beings as products of the environment
and responses to it (Cohen et al., 2007).
