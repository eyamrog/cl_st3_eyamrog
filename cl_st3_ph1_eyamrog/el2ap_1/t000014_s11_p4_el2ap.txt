Himmelmann (2006) expounds on the importance of archiving the primary
data that result from a research project in addition to
publishing the analytical results of the project, that is the
Boasian trilogy of a grammar (sketch), dictionary, and set of
texts (WOODBURY, 2003). When the primary data are archived, those
data can be reused for additional language documentation work, as
well as other types of linguistic analysis. Further, archiving the
primary and secondary data allows for the analytical output to
be verifiable and reproducible (HIMMELMANN, 2006; BEREZ-KROEKER et al., 2018).
Ultimately, archiving primary and secondary data in a digital repository
where they are publicly accessible facilitates data reuse, and provides
a stable means for citing the data (for recent guidance,
see CONZETT and DE SMEDT, 2022), in the form of
a persistent identifier. Persistent identifiers such as Digital Object Identifiers
(DOIs), Handles, and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) allow creators of
the data to receive proper attribution for their work (BEREZ-KROEKER
et al., 2018).
