After these results, it was decided to employ the principal
component method and with quartimax rotation, which indicated that the
nine subtests are grouped into three factors and explain 62.74%
of the total variance of the test (See Table 5).
Factor 1 "Executive Skills", made up of the sub-tests visual
selective attention, matrices, story comprehension, graphomotor skills and counting quantities,
explains 34.69% of the variance of B-PREA- R. Factor 2,
"Memory Skills" groups the visual working memory sub-test, which explains
15.30% of the variance. Finally, factor 3, "Linguistic Skills", made
up of the vocabulary, verbal working memory and repeating syllables
subtests, explains 12.74% of the variance.
