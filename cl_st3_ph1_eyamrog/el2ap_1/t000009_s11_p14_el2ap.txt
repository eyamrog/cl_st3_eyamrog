The use of ICT in contextual TSA has been most
frequently used for data analysis, once most CEAP courses in
the literature are locally implemented, allowing the teacher the opportunity
to investigate the target discourse community in locus. Dehnad et
al. (2010), for example, made use of computer software (SPSS)
to analyze data collected from a questionnaire given to graduate
students from a medical and management university, along with interviews
conducted with the heads of departments, the students, and a
high-ranking administrator of the university, to revise the syllabus of
a CEAP course.
