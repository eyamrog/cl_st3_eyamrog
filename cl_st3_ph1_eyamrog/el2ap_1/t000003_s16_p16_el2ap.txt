Most of the rental accommodation available in Dungannon and Cookstown
is in houses. There are few apartments. The cost of
renting a whole house is high, so, multiple occupancy is
the norm for single people of migrant origin. Some of
the Timorese who are married also share with family members
or friends from Timor-Leste.
