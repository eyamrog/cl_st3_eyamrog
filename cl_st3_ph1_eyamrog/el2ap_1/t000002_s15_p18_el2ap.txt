In order to answer whether the groups became more dialogic
(question 3), it was compared the aggregated results for non-dialogic
utterances (the sum-up of codes 1, 3 and 5) with
those considered dialogic (codes 2, 4 and 6). As the
dialogic and non-dialogic measures are mirrored images, it suffices to
conduct the statistical analysis for just one of them.
