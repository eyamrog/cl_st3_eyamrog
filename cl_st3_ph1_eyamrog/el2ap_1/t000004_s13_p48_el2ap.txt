Sandro: let’s talk about old songs. There are a lot
of different songs, but people don’t pay attention to them.
The language in them is different – when Mariana comes,
and she’s Brazilian, I can down the lyrics of the
songs and she won’t understand them. It is the language
of the people from the dark side of the society.
There are songs about a guy called Pedro Mineiro, lots
of songs about him. The language is full of dialects,
words with different meanings. For example “vapor” – for most
people, it means just “steam”, but the word used to
mean a steamboat. People these days will think of “steam”
and not “boat”. People speak different than they used to.
Therefore, if people don’t study the meaning of the songs,
they won’t understand the old masters. (...) when you say
“tabibeira” (?) “Piauí”, and “Piauí” is a state in the
Northeast of Brazil, people think you are speaking a different
language. But that’s how people really used to call a
boat. (Audio transcription)
