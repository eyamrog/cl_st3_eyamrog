The concentration of the authors responsible for these documents in
the institutions of the Southeastern and Southern states does not,
however, ignore the significant collaboration with colleagues from the rest
of the country’s extensive geography. In addition, states such as
São Paulo, Minas Gerais or Rio de Janeiro can hardly
be considered as homogeneous within each other. They include a
diversity of institutions – federal, state, private – among which
presumably there is also collaboration in terms of their publications.
And this gives further nuance to the idea of academic
inbreeding in terms of authors’ affiliation within the same state
given that, for example, collaboration between authors from Unicamp (Universidade
Estadual de Campinas) with those of USP (Universidade de São
Paulo), both in the same state, can hardly be classified
as a provincial interaction.
