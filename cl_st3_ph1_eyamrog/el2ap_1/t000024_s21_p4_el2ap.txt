Leaf number of relocated specimens at each observation, and over
time period - The results showed that leaf number of
A. distichantha bromeliads in the vegetative and reproductive (table 3)
stages transplanted as terricolous or epiphytic forms did not differ
significantly from each other (p > 0.05) during the experiment
at each period of observations. Thus, the relocation form and
phenological stage do not affect leaf emission. Also, the results
show that in both phenological stages and relocation form, the
number of leaves significantly decreased (p > 0.05) from 252
days and remained constant until the end of the experiment.
The reduction in leaves in A. distichantha e W. cyathiformis
observed in this work might be considered an adaptive response
to abiotic stress, which results in leaf senescence (Leopold 1975)
during the establishment of bromeliads in a new environment (Freitas
et al. 1998), although sprouting is part of life cycle
of bromeliads, which may have been accelerated by environmental stress.
Additionally, most bromeliads, as Vriesea neoglutinosa Mez stops producing leaves
and start producing new sprouts when they reach its maturity
(Sampaio et al. 2002). One of the abiotic stresses that
might have occurred during the experiment in all relocation form
and affected leaf emission is water deficit (drought months), observed
in July 2016 and September 2016 (figure 2). Despite the
loss of leaves, the percentage of survival was high. It
should be considered that bromeliads also absorb water retained in
the soil, through the root system, in addition to the
tanks formed by the imbrications of leaves (Nievola & Mercier1996).
Although this kind of transplanting to the soil and canopy
does not allow the accurate measurement of the emission of
new roots, it is possible to assume that these can
contribute to the absorption of mineral nutrients, which would lead
to adequate mineral nutrition for growth and development.
