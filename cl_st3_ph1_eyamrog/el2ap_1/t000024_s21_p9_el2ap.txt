Duarte & Gandolfi (2013) observed that the size of the
bromeliad specimen to be relocated could influence survival. These authors
found that the largest individuals of Aechmea bromeliifolia (Rudge) Baker
could better resist the stress of transplantation and guarantee their
permanence in the environment. Although the size of bromeliads was
not considered in this study, only adult bromeliads were allocated,
not using small plants. For this purpose, the number of
leaves with 19.61 and 13.65 in average, respectively for A.
distichantha and W. cyathiformis, was considered to indicate the growth
phase. Considering that the emergence of sprout occurs when the
largest plants reach the adult stage, these results indicate that
the selection of specimens of A. distichantha and W. cyathiformis
with sprout could improve relocation since they would have reached
a compatible development to withstand the relocation stress.
