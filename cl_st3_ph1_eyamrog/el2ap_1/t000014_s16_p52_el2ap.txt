The project participants included indigenous teachers and elders who were
knowledgeable about traditional culture. Some teachers worked with recording, and
others with transcription, translation, and metadata organization. One of the
Paresi participants also worked with video editing. A key Paresi
collaborator, Jurandir Zezokiware, participated in the documentation project with the
EN community; his presence was very important in establishing a
relationship of trust with the EN. He assisted during trainings
and collected linguistic data. The project also involved UFPA undergraduate
students, who visited the Paresi and Enawene Nawe communities to
learn about fieldwork.
