Different theoretical models have been proposed to account for emotion
regulation. The Process Model of Emotion Regulation (GROSS, 1998; GROSS;
THOMPSON, 2007) has been considered the most suitable to an
educational context (BURIĆ; SORIĆ; PENEZIĆ, 2016). For analytical purposes, this
model encompasses five families of emotion regulation strategies that progress
from the activation to the manifestation of the emotion (GROSS,
2015), namely: a) situation selection refers to actions that approach
or avoid emotion eliciting stimuli; b) situation modification refers to
actions that alter features of the external situation, thus changing
its emotional impact; c) attentional deployment refers to attempts to
pay attention to inner or outer events to modify the
emotion; d) cognitive change refers to reinterpretations of inner or
outer situations, thus altering their emotional impact and e) response
modulation refers to the direct manipulation of physiological, experiential, and
behavioral components after total emotional activation.
