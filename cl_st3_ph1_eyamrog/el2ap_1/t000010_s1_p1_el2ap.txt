The objective of this research was to determine the cultural
differences in the execution of neuropsychological tests between a group
of preschoolers with typical development in the province of Cienfuegos
and another one in Sancti Sp√≠ritus, both in Cuba; as
well as to identify the neuropsychological functions that influence intellectual
performance. Sixty- seven children were selected and subdivided into groups.
The Raven's Progressive Matrices Intelligence Test and the Luria Initial
Neuropsychological Battery were used as neuropsychological evaluation instruments. The results
showed significant differences in intelligence and various neuropsychological functions between
the provinces. The neuropsychological variables influencing intellectual performance varied depending
on the cultural groups. Taken together, the results suggest that
cultural differences demand diverse patterns of cognitive skills that uniquely
influence the development of intelligence and neuropsychological factors in preschool
childhood.
