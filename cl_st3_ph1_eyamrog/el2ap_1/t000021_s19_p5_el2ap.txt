Teachers reported using more than one emotion regulation strategy to
deal with each of the emotional demands they were presented
with. In general, cognitive change was the most used one
in conjunction with other strategies. It was used with situation
selection (n = 16), situation modification (n = 32), attention
deployment (n = 10) and response modulation (n = 14).
The most cited chainings (chains/threads) or sequences were: a) situation
selection with cognitive modification and b) situation modification with cognitive
change.
