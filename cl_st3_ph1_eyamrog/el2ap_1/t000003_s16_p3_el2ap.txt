Many of those who have taken up this entitlement to
apply for Portuguese citizenship have sought work in countries other
than Portugal, notably the United Kingdom. This trend has been
particularly marked since the recent economic downturn in Portugal. There
are no official statistics on the numbers of Timorese currently
living and working in the UK, but according to informal
estimates, the overall number is circa 15,000. Their remittances (to
family members in Timor-Leste) are highly significant: in 2008, it
was estimated that remittances to Timor-Leste from the UK amounted
to $5 million (US dollars) a year (SHUAIB, 2008). It
is likely to be much higher now, because of the
significant rise in numbers of people migrating to the UK
(see, for example, McWILLIAM, 2022).
