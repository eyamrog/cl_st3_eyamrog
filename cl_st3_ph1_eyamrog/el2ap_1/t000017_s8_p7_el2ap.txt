To overcome these weaknesses, modifications were made to the B-PREA
to make the application more attractive, shorter, and easier for
educators in the preschool educational context. In particular, the reviewers
relied on the methodological requirements of experts in early childhood
education in Cuba (Gallo et al., 2018), and the subtests
of the B-PREA were reworked according to the needs of
the preschool curriculum: to perform the comprehensive assessment of the
child according to the dimensions of education and development established
in the improvement. Similarly, it relied on resolution 238/2014, regulations
for the application of the school evaluation system of the
Ministry of Education in Cuba, to incorporate the subtests of
the B-PREA to the preschool level evaluative system, either by
applying them in the partial evaluative cut (four months after
the beginning of the school year) or in the final
evaluative cut (at the end of the school year).
