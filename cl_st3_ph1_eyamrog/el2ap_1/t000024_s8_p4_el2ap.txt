The lack of trees with pitchforks at approximately 2 m
high, which facilitate manual fixation without equipment, should also be
considered to evaluate the relocation of epiphytic bromeliads directly on
the ground, since large pitchforks are most located in the
crown of large trees. If survival of epiphytic species in
the soil is feasible for a prolonged period, direct relocation
to the ground could guarantee greater practicality, allowing the continuity
of their development by producing sprouts and inflorescences (Ara√∫jo 2006).
Considering pollination, Varassin & Sazima (2000) observed the hummingbirds Phaethornis
eurynome and Ramphodon naevius pollinating bromeliads in the lower strata
of the forest. Then, the translocation to the ground vs.
onto trees at high elevations, could not affect the pollination
of the transplanted species. Nidularium rubens, a soil species, for
example, is visited by P. eurynome (Machado & Semir 2006).
