Once the materials and metadata are archived, they are accessible
to (i.e., they can be accessed by) their creators, as
well as by collaborators, other researchers, members of the language
community, and anyone else who might need access to the
data. Furthermore, digital language archives are constructed in ways that
support discoverability of materials, that is, the ability of users
to find or discover materials they are looking for. Discoverability
is relevant both to searches within the archive itself (via
facet or targeted searching, advanced searches, etc.), and to searches
carried out via broader internet platforms such as Google indexing
and metadata harvesting by the Open Language Archives Community (OLAC).
