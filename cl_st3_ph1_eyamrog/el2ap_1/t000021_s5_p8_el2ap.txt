This was the second most prominent family of emotion regulation
strategies, suggesting that teachers constantly try to change situations (physical
and external) capable of activating negative emotions (GROSS, 1998; TAXER;
GROSS, 2018). In this study, situation modification included strategies for:
a) direct modification, the most salient one, and was characterized
(i) by adjusting the lesson plan to the specific needs
that arise in the classroom, such as adopting alternative resources
to modify the affective tone of the class, motivate the
student and facilitate learning (AKBARI et al., 2016; SUTTON, 2004)
and for (ii) facing (dialoguing or scolding) students with inappropriate
behavior to adjust their conduct or to remove them from
the room (SUTTON, 2004); b) indirect modification, characterized by the
teachers' request for school staff intervention to deal with the
students' inappropriate behavior; c) faking emotion, characterized by the intentional
display of a false emotion or intensification of the expression
of genuine emotion to model the students' behavior, (for instance,
showing either negative or positive emotions to regulate students' behavior)
(GROSS, 1998; YIN, 2016).
