DNA should be extracted from a single bacterial colony to
minimise the chance of genomic heterogeneity (see Pitfalls). While the
best method for extracting DNA can vary by organism, one
should aim to maximise purity and molecular weight. High purity
will allow for better ONT yields, as chemical and biological
impurities can damage or clog nanopores, shortening the life of
flow cells7. High molecular weight will produce longer ONT reads,
so one should avoid vortexing, minimise handling/pipetting and minimise freeze-thaw
cycles to reduce shearing of DNA molecules8. Extraction methods for
most bacteria should incorporate cell lysis by enzymatic digestion, using
lysozyme (Sigma Aldrich, L6876) followed by proteinase K digestion (as
provided in DNA extraction kits). This method is suitable for
most Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, but optimisation with additional enzymes
may be required for difficult-to-lyse bacteria. Magnetic bead-based DNA extraction
is recommended to reduce DNA shearing and maximise throughput. Recommended
kits (in order of preference) are: GenFind V3 (Beckman Coulter,
C34881) and MagAttract HMW DNA (Qiagen, 67563). For bacterial isolates
that are difficult to lyse enzymatically, bead-beating can be used,
but ONT read length may be compromised.
