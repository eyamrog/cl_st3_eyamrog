Sophie is French but a long-time resident in Leeds. She
has a fascination with Brazilian culture and the Portuguese language
which is also long standing and goes beyond capoeira to
which she is very devoted. She is one of the
more able capoeiristas in the class and Sandro will often
pick her to demonstrate a move for the group, with
himself or Tiago, another experienced capoeirista from Mozambique. A former
Brazilian boyfriend used to challenge her on why she wanted
to learn this non-standard form of Brazilian Portuguese she was
getting from her capoeira practice.
