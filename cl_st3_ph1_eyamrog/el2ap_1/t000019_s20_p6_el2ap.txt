The lack of criticism in the document stands out, by
affirming digital culture as a determinant and assuming the population
as digitally included. This uncritical assumption of technologies is explained
by the adopted views of deterministic and instrumental philosophies that,
on the one hand, regard technologies as a sure solution
to problems and, on the other hand, transfer responsibility to
those who will or will not use them (Feenberg, 2003),
without any questions about the abilities they have for this.
