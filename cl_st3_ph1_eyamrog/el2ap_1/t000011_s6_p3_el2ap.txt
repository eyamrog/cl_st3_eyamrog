The dehydration effect in plant organs formed predominantly by parenchymal
tissues has been recently described (Caliaro et al. 2013, Kampowski
et al. 2018). These authors found that the loss of
water content of petioles and hypocotyls causes a decrease in
bending stiffness. On the other hand, for stems and woody
roots in self-supporting plants predominantly formed by fibers and conducting
cells (vessel and/or tracheid), the dehydration increases the bending stiffness
of the material, making branches more brittle (Niklas 1992, Wang
& Wang 1999, Niklas & Spatz 2010, Boldrin et al.
2018). For example, in Picea sitchensis, there is a 23%
reduction in the value of bending stiffness when the moisture
content rises from 12 to 24% in woody stems (Niklas
1992). In general, our results concur with previous studies with
trees and expand this approach for liana stems. Also, the
effect size of A. crucigerum stem dehydration on bending stiffness
is six times smaller than that found for stems of
Picea sitchensis. These smaller changes in bending stiffness with the
stem dehydration on the liana may occur due to the
lianescent anatomical structure. Lianas generally have wide vessels, few fibers,
and a greater percentage of parenchyma cells and soft tissue,
increasing the capacity to store water (Tyree & Yang 1990,
Campanello et al. 2016) and forming compliant liana stems (Rowe
2018, Gerolamo et al. 2020). Indeed, the analyzed species A.
crucigerum have phloem wedges, large vessels, and wide rays, as
can be seen in figure 1, increasing the stem flexibility
and reducing the effect of dehydration.
