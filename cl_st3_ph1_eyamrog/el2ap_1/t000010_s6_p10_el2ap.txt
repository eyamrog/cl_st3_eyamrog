Thus, the present research considers that neuropsychological and intellectual development
in preschool childhood depends on sociocultural factors. These factors should
be analyzed by different categories that will allow a better
visibility of their impact, such as the family (organization, functions),
the characteristics of the parents (level of education, style of
education, stimulation activities (frequency, intensity, type of activities), and the
educational institutions (educational programs, type of educator, frequency of stimulation,
activities carried out). It would be important for future research
to observe these variables from the sociology of culture and
their relationship with the development of neuropsychological functions.
