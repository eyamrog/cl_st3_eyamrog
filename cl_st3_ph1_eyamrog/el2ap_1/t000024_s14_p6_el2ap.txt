Experimental design - Two independent experiments were carried out, using
the bromeliads Aechmea distichantha and Wittrockia cyathiformis. The experimental design
adopted was with the treatments arranged in split plot in
time, distributed in three blocks, with the main treatment being
the relocation form (epiphytic or terricolous). Additionally, the independent variables
of the Aechmea distichantha were also evaluated, considering the phenological
stage (vegetative or reproductive).
