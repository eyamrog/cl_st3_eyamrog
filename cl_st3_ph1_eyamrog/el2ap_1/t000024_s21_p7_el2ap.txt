Sprout number of relocated specimens at each observation, and over
time period- The results of relocation for A. distichantha (table
5) showed that the specimens transplanted as terricolous did not
show statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) of sprouts between
the phenological stages in each period observed. Also, the data
did not show statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) when
they were transplanted on the soil, independently of the phenological
stages, over time. This result shows that soil transplanting is
independent of the different phenological stages of A. disthichanta. However,
bromeliad of A. disthichanta (table 5) showed statistically significant differences
over time (p â‰¤ 0.05) when transplanted as epiphytic form
in the vegetative stage with an increase in the number
of sprouts at 252 days (c.a. 10%), remaining constant at
1.06 and 1.12 sprouts, while those transplanted during the reproductive
stage did not show statistically different differences (p > 0.05)
over time (table 5). The production of new organs like
sprouts can be related to leaf senescence, which can be
understood as a recycling process that contributes to better nutrient
management, leading to an efficient resource economy (Guiboileau et al.
2010). This increase in sprouts might be due to abiotic
stress, which induced the emission of axillary sprout, while bromeliads
in the reproductive stage allocated as epiphytic form did not
show a significant increase (p > 0.05) in sprout number,
since they had been induced to produce these during the
emission of the floral scape.
