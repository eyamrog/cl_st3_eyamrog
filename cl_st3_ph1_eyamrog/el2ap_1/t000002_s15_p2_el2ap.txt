Researchers have also discussed competing tensions between ‘deductive’ and ‘inductive’
approaches in analysing data (Evans, 2013; Taber, 2013). While the
former looks for evidence in relation to pre-established themes, which
undoubtedly steers analysis, the latter stems from open-minded inquiry, generates
themes from the data and uses them as an analytical
tool (Evans, 2013). In other words, the analysis can be
drawn from the conceptual framework or be grounded in data
(Taber, 2013), but both cases involve instances of creating categories,
grouping them under higher-order headings, and formulating a general description
of the research topic (Elo & Kyngäs, 2008).
