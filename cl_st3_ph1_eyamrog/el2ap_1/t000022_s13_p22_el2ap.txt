The degree of international collaboration can be observed through co-authorship.
Figure 6 shows, for six countries, the proportion of articles
authored by a single author from the country in question,
by several co-authors from that same country, and by co-authors
from that same country with co-authors from other countries. It
is interesting to compare the cases of Argentinian and Brazilian
authors. A very high proportion, 42%, of articles authored by
Argentinians are authored by a single person, a phenomenon related
to the disciplinary dominance of SSH papers. The rest are
split between those corresponding only to Argentine authors (48.3%) and
those with some type of international collaboration (9.8%). On the
other hand, articles with only one Brazilian author are relatively
few (14.1%). Here, collaboration amongst researchers affiliated to Brazil dominates
(79.6%) and is distributed throughout the geography of the largest
country in South America (see next section). It is interesting
to note that international collaboration is a very limited practice
for Brazilian authors when they publish in journals edited in
Brazil. The focus on national collaboration is hence combined with
a lower propensity for single authorship, as already mentioned.
