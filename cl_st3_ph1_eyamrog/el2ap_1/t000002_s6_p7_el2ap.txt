Here, I argue for a complementarity stance mainly in the
analytical-empirical dimension as due to the nature of the research
questions, both quanti- and qualitative methods can be required for
the educational studies (Souza & Kerbauy, 2017). That is, taking
a mixed-method approach to methodology (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998), it
is possible to juxtapose different languages in order to answer
research questions properly and coherently. As a result, while exploratory
research questions privilege a qualitative analysis, others present a confirmatory
bias should employ quantitative characterizations and comparisons.
