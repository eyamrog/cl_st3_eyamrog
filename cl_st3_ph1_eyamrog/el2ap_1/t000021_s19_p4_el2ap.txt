Regarding frequency and definition, the family of cognitive change strategies
(n = 135/30%) was the most cited and referred to
attempts to reassess the situation or teachers' ability to deal
with it to change the emotional impact it may have
caused. Situation modification (n = 117/26%) was the second most
mentioned family of strategies and referred to attempts to modify
directly or indirectly (for instance, by requesting someone else's help
or intervention) a situation to alter its emotional impact or
to intentionally display emotions (for instance, by pretending/exaggerating) to influence
students and other social actors. Response modulation (n = 69/15%)
was the third most frequent family and involved attempts to
influence the emotional response's experiential, behavioral, and physiological components. Attention
deployment (n = 63/14%) was the fourth and occurred by
redirecting attention by distracting or concentrating on something to alter
emotional responses. Finally, situation selection (N = 53/12%) involved approaching
or avoiding certain circumstances (e.g., methodologies, activities, classes, students, colleagues,
etc.) based on the prediction of emotions that may be
activated. More specifically, among the preventive strategies, direct modification (n
= 89) – situation modification - was the most cited,
followed by positive cognitive reappraisal (n = 40), external causal
attribution (n = 28), putting oneself in someone else’s place
(n = 27) and cognitive modification. Suppression (n = 25)
was strongly emphasized among the reactive strategies, followed by social
sharing (n = 21) – response modulation. Although genuine expression
(n = 19/4%) is not considered a self- regulating strategy
because experience and emotional expression are not regulated, it emerged
in focus groups as one of the ways of coping
with demands and so is discussed in this study.
