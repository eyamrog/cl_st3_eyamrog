Interventionist research has investigated and identified forms of enhanced teacher-student
interactions that support teaching and learning (e.g., Mercer, 2002). Perhaps
the main conclusion is that forms of talking have profound
implications for what is made available to learn (Howe &
Mercer, 2007; Kelly, 2014; Lemke, 2001); “the quality of student
learning is closely linked to the quality of classroom talk”
(Nystrand, 1997, p. 29).
