The communicative challenges faced by new arrivals, in dealing with
the Irish authorities and with accessing social services, is evident
in recent statistics for health and social care in Northern
Ireland. According to Doyle and McAreavey (2016), Tetum was among
the top six languages for interpreter requests made, in the
context of health and social care, between 1st April and
30th June, 2014. In those three months, 24,158 interpreter requests
were made for 41 different languages across Northern Ireland.
