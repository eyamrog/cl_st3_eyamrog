Finally, this investigation conducted using ICT tools and instruments informed
the teacher/researcher on how to better select and organize content
in the syllabus of the course, according to their level
of relevance in manuscript analysis by referees. Thus, they substantiated
the teacher/researcher praxis, once they provided relevant information, which she
used to plan, organize, and conduct her teaching practice (Vieira,
2019a). The use of ICT, as shown in this paper,
makes possible a wider contextual investigation of the TSA, reaching
not only a local but also a global community with
which students need to engage during their academic practices.
