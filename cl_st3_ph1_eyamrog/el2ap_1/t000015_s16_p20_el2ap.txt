As noted above, Latindex is a regional index, which draws
on bibliographic data from 17 national resource centers across Latin
America, the Caribbean, and the Iberian Peninsula. Of the 24,486
journals indexed in Latindex, 4,208 (17.2%) are JUOJS. On the
other hand, fully two-thirds of the JUOJS that are published
within this Iberoamerican region are indexed in Latindex.
