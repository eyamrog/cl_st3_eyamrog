Ultimately, the archiving options presented in this section represent different
levels of capacity regarding the major goals of preservation, conservation,
and accessibility, in keeping with the observations presented at the
end of ยง2 above. While smaller-scale archiving initiatives such as
those proposed here may not meet DELAMAN standards with respect
to some of these goals, they are certainly a step
in the right direction, and in some cases they may
offer more options for accessibility even where they are less
developed in their capacity for long-term preservation. Moreover, as noted
above, researchers should be aware of the possibility of archiving
both at a local or regional level and also in
a higher-infrastructure archive. This possibility is illustrated by the Paresi
and Enawene Nawe case studies described in ยง6 below.
