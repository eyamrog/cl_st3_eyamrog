This paper discusses the benefits of information and communication technologies
(ICT) in the contextual target situation analysis at a distance
to design online critical English for academic purposes (CEAP) courses.
A contextual investigation of the publishing process of high-impact journals
in computer science is presented, which is aimed at identifying
issues that might influence the publication of Brazilian researchers’ papers.
The beliefs and experiences of Brazilian authors in the aforementioned
process were analyzed through electronic questionnaires and remote interviews. Moreover,
research articles’ reviews were studied to identify the community´s criteria
for accepting or rejecting papers. Via ICT, a wider contextual
analysis was possible with participants located in different parts of
the world. Results provided relevant information about researching and publishing
in the field, which may substantiate the design of tasks
aimed at improving students’ critical academic literacy. For developing continental
countries such as Brazil, saving time and resources through ICT
in CEAP courses’ design means the possibility of investing in
a more relevant instruction, which better attends to students’ contextual
needs and wants.
