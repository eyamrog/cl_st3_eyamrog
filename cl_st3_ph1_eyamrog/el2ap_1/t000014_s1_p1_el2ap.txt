As more and more of the worldâ€™s languages become endangered,
their documentation provides key resources for linguists and communities. Documentary
linguists look to digital archives as an essential resource for
ensuring the preservation, conservation, and access of the outcomes of
their work. In this article, we consider the benefits and
challenges associated with archiving in language documentation, relating to issues
of preservation, conservation, access, ownership, and use of materials. We
draw on our accumulated knowledge as scholars who are deeply
involved in administering, contributing to, and using language archives, particularly
relating to the indigenous languages of Latin America. We focus
in particular on the relevance of language archiving in Brazil,
and its significance for scholars, community members, and other stakeholders.
Our discussion considers the steps that are needed to ensure
the quality and longevity of resources; the principles and strategies
by which archived materials may be made available; and ways
in which language archives can inform ongoing work with indigenous
languages. As we lay out here, language archives provide key
resources for scholars and for communities who wish to revitalize,
maintain, or simply remember their linguistic and cultural heritage.
