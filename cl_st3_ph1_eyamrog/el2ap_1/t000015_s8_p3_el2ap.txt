This “struggle to be properly integrated” has a postcolonial history
that Altbach addressed in the “University as Center and Periphery”
some four decades ago (1981). The “peripheral universities" of the
“Third World,” he noted, are “basically distributors of knowledge... dependent
on the central institutions for innovation and for direction.” Their
“special problems with developing research capabilities” include “few outlets for
scholarship, creative writing, and research reports by Third World intellectuals”
as “publishers are largely uninterested in Third World authors.”4 Altbach
saw this powerful "colonial educational heritage” a form of “neocolonialism”
not easily overcome: “The odds against a fully autonomous and
effective publishing enterprise being developed in the [African] continent are
high” (1976, p. 461). The universities there, he further warns,
“not only have to confront the reality of the historically
and economically based power of the industrialized nations but also…
the widespread desire by the industrial nations to maintain their
dominant positions” (1981).5
