These elements jointly create what is often called the research
paradigm, a worldview or basic belief that sets the value
of research and guides the investigator not only in the
choice of methods but also in some fundamental assumptions (Guba
& Lincoln, 1994; Treagust et al., 2014). In other words,
the research paradigm is seen as a ‘reference point’, ‘vision’,
or ‘philosophy’ that amalgamates beliefs, values, and methodologies in research
(Taber, 2013; Treagust et al., 2014). In practice, paradigms are
how the researcher thinks about and makes sense of their
study.
