Our observations and recordings show us that at a basic
level as well as embodied practice the capoeiristas are learning
on the one hand some quite deep elements of Afro-Brazilian
language and culture through songs and sayings, through transmission of
this history and the specialized register of capoeira, some of
which might not be immediately available to all Brazilians. These
are mediated (translanguaged) by Sandro through English. On the other
hand, the learners are also exposed to instructional language in
Portuguese, which is comprehensible either because it is combined with
gesture and embodied action, or, in the case of the
workshops is interpreted by Sandro. We saw for example how
Marianne is able to respond appropriately to the Mestre’s apology
with “tudo bem”. We conclude however that, while this is
a starting point, it is not enough without the supplement
of other forms of learning. We think for example that
involvement with capoeira could also enrich more mainstream Portuguese learning,
for example at tertiary level, where students of Portuguese could
benefit from the deep engagement with Afro-Brazilian language and culture
afforded by capoeira.
