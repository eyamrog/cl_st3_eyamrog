Currently, the Linguistics Area digital archive contains records of 80
indigenous languages. Of these, 73 are completely digitized, catalogued and
stored in the LAT software. The LAT files take up
2.49 TB of space; the temporal duration of these recordings
is 1,561 hours of audio and 474 hours of video.
In addition to these files, the archive also contains 9TB
of raw recordings, including High Definition video, which take up
a lot of space. Edited works, mainly for community use,
take up another 1.5 TB. Another 6 TB is occupied
by photographs and loose files of the researchers. The metadata
of the LAT files on the server can be found
at http://arqling.museu-goeldi.br. The recordings are currently not available for download,
pending reorganization of the archive and resolution of access issues.
