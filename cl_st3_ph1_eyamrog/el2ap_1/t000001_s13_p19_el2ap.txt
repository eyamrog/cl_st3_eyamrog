Small plasmids (<20 kbp) can be underrepresented in ONT read
sets, due to either ligation preparations (where circular sequences fail
to acquire adapters13) or overly aggressive QC (e.g. discarding all
reads <10 kbp). This can be avoided by using rapid
preparations and less stringent QC (e.g. only discarding reads <1
kbp). Alternatively, small plasmids can be recovered from an Illumina-
only or short-read-first-hybrid assembly graph (e.g. from Unicycler4) where they
usually appear as circular contigs separate from the rest of
the genome (Figure 2A).
