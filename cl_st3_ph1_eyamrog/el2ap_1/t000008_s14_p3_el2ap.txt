After water immersion treatments (at room temperature and hot water),
germination trials were carried out. Seeds were placed in rolls
of germitest® paper pre-moistened with distilled water at 2.5 times
dry the paper weight (Brasil 2009). All rolls of pretreated
and untreated pyrenes were kept inside plastic bags to prevent
water loss and placed in incubator set to 12 h
photoperiod of fluorescent light (4 x 20 W) and alternating
temperatures of 20-30°C, based on optimal germination condition for C.
alba (Fava & Albuquerque 2011). Rolls were rotated within the
incubators four times each week. We daily performed germination checks
for up to 45 days with protrusion of the cotyledonary
petiole ≥2 mm as the criterion for germination (Janick &
Paull 2008, Baskin & Baskin 2014).
