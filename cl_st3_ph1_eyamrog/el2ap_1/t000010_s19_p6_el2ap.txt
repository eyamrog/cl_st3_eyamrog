Secondly, although neuropsychological variables coincide in both provinces of the
country, there are particular differences that are relevant in the
research. For example: in the province of Sancti Sp√≠ritus, it
has been proved that fine motor skills (t= 2.059; p=
0.048), drawing denomination (t= -2.890; p= 0.007) and speed with
the right upper limb (t= 3.477; p= 0.001), are neuropsychological
variables that significantly predict intellectual performance in preschoolers of this
province. The level of prediction for each variable fluctuated between
0.089 and 0.252 (Table 3), while the performance of the
same neuropsychological tasks, in the Cienfuegos group, were not predictors
for the development of intelligence in children.
