Aligning ourselves with this strand of work, we take the
view that, in our endeavours to provide as full an
account as possible of the lived experience of migration among
different groups of social actors, we need to keep both
mobility and mooring (or even re-mooring) within our sights, since,
as Hannam et al. (2006, p. 2) put it: “mobilities
and mooring occur dialectically”. We need to trace the historical
specificity of particular migration trajectories and, at the same time,
we need to capture the situated ways in which mooring
(or re-mooring) occurs, along with the ways in which new
forms of social organization, new communities of practice (WENGER, 1998)
and new social activities come to be imbued with meaning.
Studies of migration, within the disciplines of anthropology and cultural
studies (e.g. BRAH, 1996, FORTIER, 2000, AHMED et al., 2003)
have sustained this dual focus. They have provided accounts of
dislocation and displacement, while also throwing light on the social
and cultural processes involved in mooring, reterritorialization or what Ahmed
et al. (2003) call regrounding.
