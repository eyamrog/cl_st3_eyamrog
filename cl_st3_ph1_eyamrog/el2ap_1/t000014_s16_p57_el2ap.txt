The metadata were initially organized in an Excel spreadsheet, then
entered into the Lameta program (HALTON et al., 2021). Each
session groups together an audio file, video file, and annotation
in ELAN (.EAF format) or elicitations in PDF. IMDI files
(ISLE Metadata Initiative) were also created for each session, and
contain information about the recordings, such as the ‘actors’ (people
involved), subject, content description, and keywords. There are also sets
of photographs organized into the following categories: community, craft, school,
daily life, researchers, training, people, and work.
