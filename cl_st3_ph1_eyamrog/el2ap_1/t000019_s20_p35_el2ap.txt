Returning to Davydov (1999), basic IT knowledge is not enough
for the superior development of individuals. Thus, having a cell
phone, even a robust one, but not knowing how to
use it or its technical potential, indicates a false evolution
in terms of digital inclusion rates and in terms of
technical knowledge and access to IT.
