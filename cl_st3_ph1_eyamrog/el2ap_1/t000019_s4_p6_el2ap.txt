Investments in technological infrastructure in schools, in incentives for students
to acquire equipment and the internet, and in training teachers
to use ICT are not proportional to the recurring insistence
that ICT and hybrid teaching methods should be used in
Brazil. The government invests in the digitalization of its services,
but it does not invest in infrastructure or in developing
and disseminating knowledge in people so that in fact they
can participate in these services. The government is absent from
investments related to the population and focuses on digitalization that
will bring savings to public spending.
