Little attention has been paid to teachers' emotions despite their
considerable relevance to teaching and student learning (AKBARI et al.,
2016; BURIĆ et al., 2016; TAXER; GROSS, 2018). Studies on
teachers' emotional experiences, especially in Brazil, have been carried out
using the theoretical framework of stress and coping, focusing mainly
on teachers' stress responses and stressful events (BURIĆ et al.,
2016; LIPP, 2016). Emotion regulation, in turn, encompasses a variety
of negative and positive emotions evoked under teachers' normative work
circumstances, which might broaden investigative possibilities on the topic.
