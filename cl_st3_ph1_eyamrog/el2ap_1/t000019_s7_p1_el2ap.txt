The expansion of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)i throughout different
professional areas, leisure and public services, triggers the need for
computer knowledge among different professionals and citizens. However, this need
for technical knowledge is not a requirement only for those
who make up the specific professional circle of Informatics. Not
having an e-mail and not knowing how to use it,
for example, can mean not using many public services. This
example is minimal, because, in reality, citizensâ€™ need for IT
knowledge goes way beyond their need for effective social participation.
