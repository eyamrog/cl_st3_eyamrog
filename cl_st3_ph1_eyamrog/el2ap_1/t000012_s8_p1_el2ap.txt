In ecological communities, ecological interactions connect individuals of different species.
Ecological interactions have far-reaching consequences for population ecology (Macarthur 1955,
Jordano 2016) and evolution (Drossel et al. 2001, Guimarães et
al. 2011), affecting the persistence of biodiversity at community level
(Paine 1966, Fontaine et al 2006, Hale et al. 2020).
At community level, ecological interactions often form networks because pairs
of interacting species are linked to each other (Pascual &
Dunne 2006; Jordano et al. 2006). Several types of interactions,
such as mutualisms among plants and seed dispersers and pollinators
(Bascompte et al. 2003), predator and prey interactions among mammals
(Pires & Guimarães 2013), facilitative interactions among plant species (Verdú
2010), and cleaning interactions among fish (Guimarães et al. 2007)
form species-rich networks showing a myriad of nonrandom network patterns.
These nonrandom network patterns include nestedness (e.g. Guimarães et al.
2007; Bascompte et al. 2003) and modularity (e.g. Olesen et
al. 2007).
