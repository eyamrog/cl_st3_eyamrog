Up to 1942 there are less than 100 documents per
year; up to 1990, less than 1,000; and up to
1999, less than 10,000. The highest number is reached in
2015, with 58,025 articles. These values should be interpreted with
caution because they are not necessarily representative of the history
of journals in Latin America and the Caribbean. Indeed, we
were able to verify that, in most of the older
journals, the digitization and availability of the volumes prior to
1998 is patchy. There is only information for 78 journals
and it corresponds to documents published before 1998 - the
year SciELO was launched - so that the inclusion of
documents prior to the year of the indexing of a
journal by that time seems exceptional.
