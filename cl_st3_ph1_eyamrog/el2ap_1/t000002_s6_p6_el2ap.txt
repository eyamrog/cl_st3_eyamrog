From a theoretical point of view, Filho (2013) brings an
instigating theoretical discussion on the incommensurability, complementary, and unity of
the paradigms. Researchers from the first thesis argue that the
realism and interpretivism views are in strict opposition and therefore
are incompatible. The ones who advocate in favour of complementarity
say that both paradigms are legitimate as they are not
in necessarily conflict. Moreover, in the empirical domain, each paradigm
aligns to goals that could not be tackled with another.
Finally, the unity between these paradigms is considered mainly by
pos- positivist and critical philosophers who defend that there is
no logical and consistent way to divide knowledge into radical
terms.
