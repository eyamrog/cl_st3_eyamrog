It is well known that the temperature and humidity of
the environment directly affect the hydric conditions of plant structures
and that both anatomical composition and hydric condition affect biomechanical
properties of each plant structure (Niklas 1992, Vincent 1992, Rowe
et al. 2005). For this reason, most studies with biomechanics
on plants keep the samples moist right after collection to
obtain the closest results from those of living plants in
the natural environment. However, until the present study, it was
not known the magnitude of the dehydration effect on the
values of bending stiffness and fracture toughness of lianas stems
and leaves, respectively.
