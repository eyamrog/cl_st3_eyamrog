As an example of qualitative method, sociocultural discourse analysis is
presented and applied to trace relationships between classroom interaction and
conceptual learning. Such analysis consisted of closely examining the episodes
aiming at generating categories and illustrating them with selected extracts.
This focus enabled researchers to search not simply for a
specific discursive function but to investigate whole forms of interactions
that can be used to generate typologies and evaluate their
impact on particular educational purposes. In addition, this method deals
with language “content, function, and the ways shared understanding is
developed in social context, over time” (Mercer, 2010, p. 9).
