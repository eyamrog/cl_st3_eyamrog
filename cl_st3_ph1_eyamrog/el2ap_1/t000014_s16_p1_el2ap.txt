In this section, we take a closer look at archiving
initiatives within Brazil, and their relevance for indigenous language documentation
within this country. In light of the large number of
indigenous languages in Brazil and their precarious situation (MOORE, GALUCIO,
and GABAS, 2008), language documentation is urgent, and it is
widely supported among indigenous groups. In the survey of the
languages of the state of Rond√¥nia by the National Inventory
of Linguistic Diversity, documentation was indicated as the second priority
of indigenous people in relation to the language of the
groups, with the correction of defective orthographies and production of
correct written material being the first priority (GALUCIO, MOORE and
VAN DER VOORT, 2018, p. 217). Many indigenous groups have
young people trained in computer literacy, a fact that facilitates
digital documentation. Potentially, a large number of recordings can be
produced. Their permanent preservation and availability requires a huge storage
capacity in digital files.
