Some of the club organisers and managers incorporated Timorese cultural
practices and values into the management of club funds. This
was, for instance, the case with the FC Lao Rai
club. This practice came to our attention during an interview
we held with one of the managers (Interview with MFB,
June 2015). Blending Tetum with Portuguese and English as he
spoke, he pointed out to us that this football club
took care of the welfare of its players well beyond
matters pertaining to football. For example, if someone needed help
to pay for a return trip to Timor-Leste (e.g., for
a family funeral), club funds were contributed towards the cost
of the airfare. As he described this practice, he made
explicit reference to the Timorese cultural practice known as lia
mate, lia moris. This refers to the customary obligations on
members of an extended family in Timor-Leste, and cultural rituals
(lia), relating to death (mate) and life (moris). These obligations
and cultural practices constitute a key aspect of the organisation
of the life worlds of Timorese in Timor-Leste and in
the diaspora. They involve providing material and moral support at
times such as funerals, weddings, christening and so on. All
those associated with the Lao Rai club paid £10 each
per month towards the running of the club. The club
manager also noted (in English) that all the football clubs
had grown in importance in bringing people together and had
become “better organised in the last few years” (Same interview
with MFB, June 5, 2015).
