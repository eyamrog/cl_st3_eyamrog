When the codes' occurrences are counted, such a method provides
a broad overview of data sample and allows the establishment
of patterns within and across events (Snell & Lefstein, 2011).
However, this technique is not free of problematic issues, as
there is a trend to fragment the data and lose
context or other meanings that are not captured in the
codes (Cohen et al., 2007). Therefore, systematic coding might be
seen as reductionist (Mercer et al., 2004; Snell & Lefstein,
2011). The next subsection shows an example of the kinds
of research questions and findings that systematic coding might provide.
