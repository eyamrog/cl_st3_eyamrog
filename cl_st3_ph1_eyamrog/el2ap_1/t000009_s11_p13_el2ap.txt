For the CEAP course design, nevertheless, there is a need
for widening the scope of TSA. Since CEAP also focuses
on contextual issues of the present and target situations, TSA
must provide ways of eliciting information on social, political, and
ideological features of the discourse community, which promotes and sustains
power relations among members. In this context, Benesch (1996) advocates
for a critical perspective on a needs analysis that acknowledges
the hierarchical configuration of institutions. Concerning the TSA, a critical
perspective also identifies the socio-cognitive demands related to the use
of English by the target community, but goes further and
treats them as a site of possible reform. ICT, then,
has much to contribute to contextual target situation analysis.
