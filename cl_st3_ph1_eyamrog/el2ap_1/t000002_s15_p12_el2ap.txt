To conclude, this scheme made it possible to describe classroom
talk and evaluate dialogicity; both goals were at the core
of the research questions. Classroom talk could be described by
comparing the relative code occurrences within each context (content, instruction,
off-topic) and dialogicity evaluated by considering the frequency of dialogic
utterances in relation to simple ones.
