On the contrary, hot water treatments negatively affected the germination
process. The germination percentage (G%) of freshly harvested pyrenes of
C. alba decreased to 62 and 50% for 5 and
10 minutes of exposure, respectively (Figure 2 a, b). Such
treatments also reduced the germination percentage of stored pyrenes to
21% for 5-min and 16% for 10-min of exposure (Figure
2 b). Additionally, the 5-min hot water treatment delayed the
mean germination time of freshly harvested pyrenes to 30 days
(Figure 2 c), with no effect on MGT after storage
(Figure 2 d). Likewise, hot water treatments jeopardized the germination
of Euterpe oleracea Mart. (Arecaceae) seeds from the Amazon rainforest
(Bovi & Cardoso 1976). Heat shock also did not break
the seed dormancy of A. aculeata (Jacq.) Lodd. ex Mart.
(macaw palm) but caused high seed deterioration rates (Rodrigues-Junior et
al. 2016).
