Mooring and remooring imply considerable agency on the part of
the social actors involved. In the case of labour migration,
it involves finding accommodation and work, but also identifying spaces
where recreational activities associated with the place of origin can
be organised, and also working out how these activities might
be organised, and by whom. In the case of remooring,
these social processes are necessarily iterative.
