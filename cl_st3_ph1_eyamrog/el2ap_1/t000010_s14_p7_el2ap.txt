The research was carried out in three sessions, with a
duration of 45 to 60 minutes and 5 minutes of
rest when the children required it. In the first session,
the children's Raven test was performed; and in the second
and third sessions, the Luria Initial Neuropsychological Battery was administered.
They were distributed in this way, with the aim of
avoiding mental fatigue and demotivation of the child by the
instrument.
