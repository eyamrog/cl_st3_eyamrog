CEAP advocates, then, for a third main principle: criticism, which
stands for a bigger focus on contextual issues during language
classes. That means approaching injustices and inequalities in the target
and in the present situation (Benesch, 1996). By analyzing and
reflecting upon contextual elements which, at the same time, shape
and are shaped by the target language, Benesch (2009) explains
that CEAP may help students to reconceptualize their sense of
citizenship, their own identities, and their critical thinking regarding their
roles in the target discourse community. They might be able,
then, not only to recognize and reproduce their peersâ€™ discourse,
but also to identify what needs to be changed, when
and how, promoting social improvements in the community.
