Figure 2 shows code distributions for contexts of group talk
as a whole and discursive functions across tasks. Only a
small number of significant differences between groups were found. For
instance, the analysis for context showed a significant difference in
content (H(6) = 17.575, p = .007) between Tasks 3–4
(p = .037) and Tasks 3–5 (p = .022), as
well as in off-topic (H(6) = 14.007, p = .029)
between Tasks 3-5 (p = .046). No difference was found
in instruction. Broadly speaking, students talked more about the content
and less off-topic in Tasks 2 and 3.
