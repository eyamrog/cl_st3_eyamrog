As in the study by Burić et al. (2016), teachers
reported experiencing a wide range of emotions with significant intensity
when teaching, interacting, and dealing with students. However, they also
focused more intensely on negative emotions, illustrating their efforts to
regulate them. In general, primary emotions of anger and sadness
stood out and were mainly related to interactional demands such
as student misbehavior and peer/boss relationships, which is similar to
other studies (e.g., BURIĆ et al., 2016; CHANG; DAVIS, 2009;
TAXER; GROSS, 2018). The technical-pedagogical demands also seem to trigger
negative but less intense emotions, such as frustration, worry, compassion,
helplessness, and anguish. Additionally, teachers still regulate frustration arising from
intrapersonal demands such as internal conflicts and dissatisfaction. The findings
of Taxer and Frenzel (2015) suggest that the genuine display
of negative emotions is related to teacher-student relationship impairment and
emotional exhaustion, which underscores the importance of emotion regulation in
this occupation.
