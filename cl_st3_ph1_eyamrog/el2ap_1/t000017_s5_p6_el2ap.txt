In story comprehension, a task similar to subtest 3 "story
recall" of the Woodcock-Muñoz Battery III, achievement test (Muñoz-Sandoval et
al., 2005), the child must listen attentively to the adult's
writing to understand the explicit message of the text (what
are the characters, what is the relationship between them, what
is the story) and finally answer six literal questions in
each story. This subtest has a significant relationship with oral
language development, and precisely the Woodcock-Muñoz Battery III places "story
recall" in the comprehension-knowledge factor, although the solution to the
story comprehension subtest requires high levels of focused attention and
working memory to maintain, manipulate and transform the relevant information
of the story. Likewise, it is important to highlight that
this subtest does not have visual support; therefore, it is
a requirement for the child to listen attentively to the
story and retain the relevant information about the story. Thus,
the latent variables underlying the story comprehension subtest are more
executive than linguistic; however, the result could change in future
research due to the size of the sample.
