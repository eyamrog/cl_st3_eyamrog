hairs or rarely with primitive scales. Leaves monomorphic; stipes often
with epipetiolar buds, usually with a omega-shaped vascular strand; laminae
2-5-pinnate, rarely less dissected; veins free or rarely anastomosing and
then without included veinlets; indument formed by hairs or glandular
hairs, or absent. Sori marginal or submarginal, linear or discrete,
introrse or extrorse, protected by outer and/or inner indusia or
rarely not protected; spores tetrahedral and trilete, or reniform and
monolete (Smith et al. 2006).
