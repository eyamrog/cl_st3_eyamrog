The corpus of documents analyzed in this work is the
result of a database that combines information from two of
the main indexers of Latin American and Caribbean scientific journals
- SciELO and Redalyc. Thanks to the collaborative work of
both institutions and CLACSO, we can appreciate the decades of
effort that these open access publishing platforms have made and
the extent to which there now is a Latin American
production with high standards of quality whose value is still
under-represented in current academic assessment models. Perhaps one of the
main findings that emerges from the analysis is the longevity
and diversity of the journals, some of which were created
in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries8. There is
also a diverse representation of disciplinary areas, modes of collaboration,
languages of publication, types of authorship, authors' geographic state of
affiliation, and publishing institutions over a period of more than
a century of Latin American and Caribbean scientific production.
