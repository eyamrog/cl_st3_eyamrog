Narrowing our research lens, and focusing in on the different
activities taking place around the football clubs gave us revealing
insights into the complex and multi-faceted processes of identification at
work in this migration context. Diverse Timorese identities were being
constructed in ways that related to the past and the
present. These identities were indexed in the use of linguistic
resources, and also in a range of semiotic resources, including
images, colour and different material, textual and online resources. As
we saw in Table 2, there were clubs that asserted
a regional identity and others that emphasised inclusivity and a
broader Timorese-ness. Some of the branding practices, such as the
use of the colours of the national flag in the
logos in Figure 1, and in the ribbons for the
medals, in Figure 3, indexed national identity. In addition, some
clubs adopted symbols of cultural heritage, such as the woven
tais and the image of the crocodile. Furthermore, linguistic resources
and symbols associated with international football culture were imbricated with
these diverse ways of representing Timorese-ness.
