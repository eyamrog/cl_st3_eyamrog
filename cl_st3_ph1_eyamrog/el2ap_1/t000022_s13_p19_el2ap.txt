These trends within the social sciences undergo some variations if
the analysis is segmented by the country of publication of
the journals. Journals edited in Brazil, Cuba and Puerto Rico
have, on average, 38.6% of their articles with only one
author, a value significantly lower than that of the area
as a whole. At the other end of the scale,
the journals in the Social Sciences of Bolivia and Ecuador
are largely dominated by single authorship (76.8% and 77.4%, respectively).
The incidence of single authorship for journals edited in the
remaining nine countries (Panama does not have any) ranges from
53.8% for Colombia to 62.4% for Mexico of articles with
one author. Among the journals in the Humanities, differences can
also be noted but to a lesser extent. In Cuba,
64.2% of articles in journals in the Humanities have only
one author. In Brazil, the percentage is 70%, which is
not far from 70.1% in Uruguay or 73.6% in Chile,
for example. In Argentina it is more than 80%, while
Mexico reaches 87.6% and Costa Rica 89.2%.
