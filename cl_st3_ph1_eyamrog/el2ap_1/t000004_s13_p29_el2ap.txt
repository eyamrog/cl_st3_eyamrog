This notion of using the dance as a disguise is
present in the present-day capoeira as well. Sandro liked to
challenge the idea that capoeira is a dance by saying
– ‘if capoeira is a dance, then dance with me!’
The difference between capoeira and a dance is the combat
dimension: capoeiristas are in a state of alertness, they know
that an attack can come at any point.
