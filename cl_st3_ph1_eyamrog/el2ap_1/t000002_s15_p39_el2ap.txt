Neither of the examples show clear evidence of exploring or
deepening students’ ideas. Instead, it might be said that the
teachers had clear objectives and tried to achieve them together
with students. I would say that they were successful in
highlighting the comparative analogy between water and perfume evaporation and
emphasising a microscopic explanation of the evaporation process. The student
contributed with few words and, apparently, followed the teachers’ line
of reasoning.
