During the game of capoeira, the two adversaries watch each
other closely, trying to read and predict each other’s movements
and to respond to them quickly – either by an
attack or escape, using the techniques in their repertoire. They
may also decide to perform a few ginga movements, when
their movements are synchronized to mirror each other. However, even
during this moment there is a sense of an imminent
attack that may come at any point from either of
the capoeiristas.
