Socializing is an inseparable part of capoeira practice. In Brazil,
capoeira rodas often finish with dancing samba de roda. In
a similar way, both capoeira workshops and some of the
classes we observed ended with socializing, either in a bar
or the house of one of the students. On those
occasions, capoeira and African/ Brazilian culture is often discussed and
Portuguese language spoken, therefore they represent another occasion for the
students to expand their knowledge. The students also get to
know each other better, which supports the cohesion and friendly
atmosphere of the whole capoeira school.
