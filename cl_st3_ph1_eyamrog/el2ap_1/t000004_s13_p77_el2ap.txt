Although the roda is saturated with a culturally rich lexis
it is basically a space for the conversation between bodies
and is largely non-verbal, though gestural elements are involved such
as the opening invitation and the closing submission stage, all
involving culturally rich gestural action that capoeiristas must learn. Sophie’s
verbal and gestural apology to Mestre João is therefore relatively
unusual. The other constant element of the roda and capoeira
practice more generally is of course the interaction of bodies
with music, the music setting the rhythm and pace for
the embodied interaction.
