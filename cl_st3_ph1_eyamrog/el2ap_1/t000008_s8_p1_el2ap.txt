Palm seeds often display morphophysiological dormancy due to underdeveloped embryos
(Baskin & Baskin 2014) and a thick endocarp that delays
germination and embryo growth (Pérez 2009, Ribeiro et al. 2011,
Oliveira et al. 2013, Carvalho et al. 2015, Oliveira et
al. 2015, Soares et al. 2021). Water treatments may accelerate
the germination process of palm seeds by facilitating oxygen absorption
and loosening mechanical restrictions of the surrounding tissues (e.g., Bovi
1990, Martin et al. 1996, Ferreira & Gentil 2006, Fava
& Albuquerque 2011, Rubio Neto et al. 2012, Pinto et
al. 2012, Goudel et al. 2013, Ferreira et al. 2021).
On the other hand, hot-water treatments (~75°C) have been tested
on the germination of tropical palm seeds but may not
promote a dormancy break (Martin et al. 1996, Rodrigues-Junior et
al. 2016).
