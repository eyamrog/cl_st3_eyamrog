The analysis of collaboration structures in a corpus such as
OLIVA delved into the complexities of national collaboration to distinguish
between co-authorships belonging to the same institution and those collaborations
that represent a combination of efforts from different universities and
especially from different states, thereby examining the geospatial dynamics of
national scientific production. The analysis of Brazil, which represents one-third
of the total number of journals as well as half
of the authors and articles in the OLIVA database, showed
that there is strong collaboration between researchers from different states
throughout the country. We also characterized the states that, by
their own importance, play an important role in the corpus
and yet show significant collaboration with colleagues from states with
less weight in the Brazilian scientific system.
