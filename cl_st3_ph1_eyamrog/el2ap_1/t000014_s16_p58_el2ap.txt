All data from the Paresi project are stored in the
archive of the Museu Paraense Em√≠lio Goeldi, but are not
yet available to the public. Twenty hours of material collected
during the period of financial support from ELDP (2011-2012) were
also stored in the archive associated with this institution, the
Endangered Language Archive (ELAR).17 Another thirty hours are stored at
the Archive of the Indigenous Languages of the Americas (AILLA),18
based at the University of Texas at Austin, with some
materials available online. Part of the material collected in the
Enawene Nawe project was organized in ELAR19 and will also
be made available in the Goeldi archive.
