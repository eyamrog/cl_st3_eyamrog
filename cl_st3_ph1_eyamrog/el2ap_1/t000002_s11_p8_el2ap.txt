There is criticism about both paradigms. Positivist researchers might be
seen as superficial and limiting, as they do not grasp
the inner contradictions and assume that the same finding or
solutions can be applied in every context (Taber, 2013). At
the same time, interpretivist studies have sometimes been critiqued for
being anecdotal or not methodically rigorous, resulting in a lack
of generalisation or scalability.
