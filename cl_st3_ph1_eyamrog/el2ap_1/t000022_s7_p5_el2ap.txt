Vuotto, Di CÃ©sare and Pallotta (2020) analyzed 17 bibliographic databases
and verified that currently there are still few of them
that openly offer their elements in a common format and
structure to enable the analysis of production at the document
level. For this reason, to date, the available empirical studies
have only been able to analyze the journal collections separately
as offered by each of the indexing databases. Scopus has
890 journals that are published in the region, and Web
of Science has 223. As of June 2021, SciELO had
1,358 active, indexed journals which are also replicated in the
SciELO Citation Index in the Web of Science platform, allowing
for the evaluation of the performance of the articles in
a global context of citations. Redalyc, for its part, has
its own information system and indicators for its collection of
1,415 journals. These two collections have many journals in common,
as we will see shortly. Then there is also Biblat
which has its own cataloging system with a large number
of complete records at the document level. However, at present
it is not possible to work with combined data from
these three indexing databases in the region because they are
not interoperable. To these sources LA Referencia should be added.
It is a very relevant database which harvests the production
of 790 institutions from 12 Ibero-American countries. It currently has
more than three million documents. However, it does not have
advanced searching by journal, and there are overlaps of data
with the former indexing services given that it originates from
the repositories of the individual institutions.
