Almost twenty years have passed since the inclusion of ICT
in education. All these years of experience exchange among teachers,
researchers, and institutions – provided by ICT – have led
to educational (re)organization and improvement. Recent works in the literature
illustrate the new possibilities brought by the digital era. Regarding
research and practice of language teaching and learning, ICT has
contributed to modernizing traditional teaching approaches and practices (cf. Eckhaus,
2018) and to developing new teaching tools and materials (cf.
Sahraini & Syamsudarni, 2018). English for specific purposes (ESP) has
also benefited from ICT in mainly two ways (Bloch, 2012):
(i) changing traditional types of language learning with new tools,
and (ii) creating new forms of communicating, enabling students to
engage with their discourse community during classes. Less attention has
been given to the use of ICT in needs analysis
though, especially regarding the target situation. When analyzing the future
communicative needs of students, technology has mainly been used in
the investigation of linguistic (cf. Ha & Hyland, 2017) and
textual features (cf. Supatranont, 2012) of specialized discourse. This paper
presents the benefits of using ICT to investigate contextual features
of language use in the target situation.
