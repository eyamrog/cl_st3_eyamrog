The basic organization of legacy materials can be difficult if
the objects in question (e.g., field notes, tapes) have little
metadata associated with them, and if specialists who might be
able to read or understand the spoken version of a
particular language cannot be consulted. Additionally, some objects may be
in a format that is not easily accessed, for example,
as is often the case with the analog reel-to-reel tapes
that were commonplace from the 1950s to the 1970s, an
especially valuable period in the documentation of many languages. Depending
on the specific situation, at this juncture it may be
beneficial to collaborate with community members who can assist in
the interpretation of the materials, or to first have them
digitized, either by an external professional audio technician12 or by
an archive as part of a donation. Regardless, the main
goal of this step of organization is to produce a
basic inventory of objects (how many notebooks, tapes, etc.) before
they are transported, so that there is a record that
can be corroborated to ensure that all the materials arrive
at their intended destination. If metadata is lacking, other descriptions
of the physical objects can be given (e.g., “two tapes
with red design on cover”).
