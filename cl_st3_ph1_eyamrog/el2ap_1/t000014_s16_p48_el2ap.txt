Both languages belong to the Arawakan family (PAYNE, 1991; AIKHENVALD,
1999; RAMIREZ, 2001). Brandão, Carvalho and Pereira (2018) and Pereira
(2018) present evidence that Enawene Nawe (hereinafter EN) and Paresi
are very closely related, and together with the Saraveka language
form a subgroup, which they term Juruena. In previous classifications
of the Arawak family, only Fabre (2005) suggested a proximity
between Paresi and Enenawe Nawe, whereas Payne (1991) grouped Paresi
together with Waurá in a Central group, and Aikhenvald (1999)
likewise classified Paresi together with the Xingu languages in a
‘Paresi-Xingu’ branch.
