Pteridium is spread all across the globe (except for Antarctic)
and may be the one most important to mankind by
if directly affects the local human populations: it behaves as
a pioneer weed invading croplands; it spreads its underground rhizomes
making it hard to be removed; it intoxicates the cattle
and horses; and it also intoxicates humans, when ingested -
some studies also pointed out the transmission of its toxins
(the psilatoquinis) via cow milk (e.g., Tryon 1941, Evans 1976,
Page 1976, Marrs et al. 2000, Martini-Santos et al. 2010,
Oliveira et al. 2018, Schwartsburd et al. 2018).
