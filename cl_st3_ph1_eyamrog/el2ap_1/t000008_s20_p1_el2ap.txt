Copernicia alba Morong seeds displayed no evidence of dormancy in
the tested treatments. Freshly harvested pyrenes germinated 84% (Figure 2
a), indicating a high germination percentage. Masetto et al. (2012)
also found similar findings for the same species collected in
a natural area in the Pantanal. Contrasting with our study,
Masetto et al. (2012) and Fava & Albuquerque (2011) affirmed
that the study species exhibits seed dormancy. Genetic factors may
affect seed germination by influencing seed viability and quality in
the same species from different areas (Soler-Guilhen et al. 2020).
Initial moisture content of the pyrenes was ~10%, with corresponding
results of 10% (Fabri 2018) and 16.6% (Masetto et al.
2012) for the same species. In both studies fruits were
collected from natural populations of Pantanal wetland in the Mato
Grosso do Sul State. The thick endocarp of C. alba
was permeable to water, not impeding the seeds from germinating.
Seeds surrounded by a stony endocarp may block the germination
causing its delay for months or years, such as reported
to Butia capitata Mart.Becc. (Soares et al. 2021) and Syagrus
romanzoffiana (Cham.) Glassman. (Oliveira et al. 2015), both species from
the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado), and Bactris maraja Mart from the
Amazon Forest (Rodrigues et at. 2014). Fortunately, the lack of
seed dormancy of C. alba can warrant recruitment in the
Pantanal wetlands where seeds/pyrenes are subjected to flooding conditions demonstrated
by a rapid flush of seedling emergence in the post-flood
environment (Bao et al. 2018). Even though many palm seeds
may display morphophysiological dormancy related to the undeveloped embryo and/or
mechanical restrictions imposed by a thick endocarp (PÃ©rez 2009, Baskin
& Baskin 2014), pyrenes of our study species can be
easily germinated under laboratory conditions.
