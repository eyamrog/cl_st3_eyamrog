In our fieldwork we observed a total of six classes
of capoeira, taking place at a community centre one evening
per week, sometimes followed by a drink in a nearby
social club. We also observed two capoeira workshops delivered by
visiting mestres invited by Sandro, one of which took place
in a community centre in Leeds and one in a
church hall in York. These workshops occupied the whole afternoon,
starting at around 2pm and lasting until approx. 6 pm.
One of them was followed by a drink and a
dinner in a nearby pub, the other one by a
party in one of the student’s house, where Brazilian food
was served. We have also observed one roda, organized during
the weekend and attended mostly by Sandro’s students from Leeds
and York. The roda took place in an Afro-Cuban drumming
studio.
