As for teachers, 56% say they know how to manipulate
files / folders and 29% know how to create files
for a slide show (CGI.br, 2019b). Note that they are
simple activities but yet, the number of teachers who can
master them remains low. Only 34% of teachers over 30
years of age participated in continuing education, 54% of teachers
up to 30 years of age took some discipline on
ICT during their college education years and 70% of teachers
use DICT only for their pedagogical and academic planning.
