At the end of all germination trials, we assessed the
germination percentage (G%) and mean germination time (MGT) based on
the number of daily germinated pyrenes (Labouriau 1983, Ranal &
Santana 2006). Additionally, we calculate the germination speed index according
to Maguire (1962). Non- germinated pyrenes were classified as dormant
or dead, although a tetrazolium test was not performed to
evaluate if the seeds were or were not viable; neither
dormant nor dead seeds were included in the data.
