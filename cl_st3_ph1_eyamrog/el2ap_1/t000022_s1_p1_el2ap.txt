This article presents the results of the Latin American Observatory
of Evaluation Indicators (OLIVA, its Spanish acronym) which works to
raise the visibility of the scientific production indexed in Latin
America and the Caribbean, and to enhance its value for
research assessment. This study deals with the production published in
open access by journals indexed in SciELO and Redalyc, based
on a deduplicated database of a total of 908,982 documents
and 2,591,704 authors. It highlights the magnitude of this production
and describes its disciplinary diversity, as well as trends in
national, regional, and international research collaboration. It also examines the
publishers of the 1,720 journals that make up the database
of journals from 15 countries and highlights the predominance of
universities and public institutions in this regional circuit. The journals
that operate with the APC model are analyzed, confirming a
clearly lower influence of this model compared to what is
observed in other continents, although Brazil is identified as the
country with the greatest incidence of this practice in the
region. Finally, collaboration between states in Brazil, analyzed with SciELO
data, proves to be highly significant, strongly challenging the traditional
interpretation of co-authorship among researchers from the same country as
academic inbreeding. The study concludes that these journals show multi-scalar
circulation, a linguistic diversity, and a disciplinary breadth that can
very effectively serve the current needs of scholarly communication in
times of open science.
