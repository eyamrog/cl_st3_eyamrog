Evidence suggests that various emotion regulation strategies are used in
the classroom (e.g., AKBARI et al., 2017; TAXER; GROSS, 2018).
For instance, some teachers might adopt strategies to prevent attending
to student misbehavior, whereas others might use reactive strategies such
as leaving the classroom until they achieve emotional balance (AKBARI
et al., 2017; SUTTON, 2004). In another study by Taxer
and Gross (2018), teachers reported mainly using response modulation (e.g.,
suppression) strategies. In an opposite vein, Sutton (2004) and BuriÄ‡
et al. (2016) found that teachers prefer using cognitive change
(e.g., reappraisal) strategies. However, Akbari et al. (2017) found that
teachers were more likely to use situation selection and modification
strategies. Taken together, these findings reveal divergent conclusions regarding the
use of emotion regulation strategies by teachers. These discrepancies might
be accounted for, in part, by contextual factors that were
not adequately explored in previous research (FRIED et al., 2015).
