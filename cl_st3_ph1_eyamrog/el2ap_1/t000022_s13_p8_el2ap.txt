Let us now take a closer look at the disciplinary
features of the journals that make up the OLIVA database.
Journals from the Social Sciences represent 33% of the total,
Medical and Health Sciences 19%, Humanities 12% and Natural and
Exact Sciences 10%. However, if we look at the disciplinary
distribution by country of publication, we see that journals in
the Social Sciences are predominant in Uruguay, Ecuador, Puerto Rico,
Brazil, Bolivia, Mexico and Peru (see Figure 3). Medical and
Health Sciences journals have an important share in Cuba, Uruguay,
Bolivia, Costa Rica and Peru. Journals in the Natural and
Exact Sciences have their greatest relative presence in Argentina, Bolivia
and Brazil. Figure 3 shows the disciplinary areas of the
journals and allows for comparing their distribution in less visible
countries such as those in Central America and the Caribbean
with the large players in the region.
