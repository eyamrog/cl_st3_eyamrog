These archives are available in English (ELAR) or in English
and Spanish (AILLA), but they do not yet have access
information in Portuguese,20 which makes it more difficult for Paresi
and Enenawe Nawe people to access them. In the future,
we intend to make these collections available in regional digital
archives near the communities, potentially housed in universities (e.g. the
Federal University of Mato Grosso [UFMT]), intercultural colleges, and/or indigenous
schools. Speakers could thereby have physical access to the server
where the materials are stored, as well as easier access
via the internet.
