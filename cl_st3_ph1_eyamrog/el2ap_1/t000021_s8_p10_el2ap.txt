Other issues have been raised regarding research on teachers' emotions.
For instance, in terms of emotion regulation strategies and their
consequences, studies have shown a tendency to focus on specific
tactics used by teachers. For example, a study by Yin
et al. (2016) revealed that, under emotionally exhaustive circumstances, teachers
were more likely to suppress than to reappraise their emotions.
Similarly, BuriÄ‡ et al., (2016) found that reappraisal is usually
more beneficial and that suppression is associated with exhaustion. As
can be observed, studies tend to group teachers' emotion regulation
strategies into adaptive and maladaptive categories, neglecting, to some extent,
their primary functions and the influence of personal and situational
factors.
