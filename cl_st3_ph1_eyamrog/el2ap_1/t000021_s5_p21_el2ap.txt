Differences in teachers' emotion regulation were inferred according to the
area of training or teaching and the career period. Firstly,
a greater frequency and variety of strategies were identified in
groups in the basic area, especially among non-beginners, in line
with Sutton et al. (2009) and BuriÄ‡ et al. (2016),
evidencing that more experienced teachers are more efficient in emotional
regulation. Second, although the situation modification and cognitive change families
stood out in all groups, subtle differences were noted in
the strategies of these families, suggesting that teachers in the
basic area tend to use strategies for approaching and coping
with emotional demands. In contrast, technical domains tend to use
strategies to avoid such demands. These differences are accentuated when
comparing beginner and non-beginner groups, suggesting that career time strengthens
these trends. In other words, among teachers from the basic
area, non-beginners seem to face more demands and have greater
variability in regulation than beginners. For technical education teachers, this
relationship has been reversed, so that the experience seems to
reinforce the avoidance patterns.
