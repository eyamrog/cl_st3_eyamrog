Basic common knowledge is essential to trigger and develop scientific
knowledge, that is, it has its relevance, but the school
should not be restricted by it. The school exists to
teach us what is not taught on a daily basis.
Being stuck using only everyday knowledge does not raise the
capacities of thinking, because, for that to happen, an understanding
of the concept of things is necessary, to develop dialectical
thinking from an early age. For example, there are many
who know how to make bread, but not everyone knows
how to explain the physical-chemical processes that take place for
bread to become bread; and only those who know how
to explain the reasons have mastery of the subject, being
able to use this knowledge to analyze and recreate.
