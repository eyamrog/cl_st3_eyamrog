Some bacterial taxa have undergone proliferation of insertion sequence elements
in their evolution, resulting in genomes with hundreds of 1–2
kbp repeats37,38. Perfect assembly of such genomes can be challenging
because short-read polishers struggle to repair errors in high-copy-number repeats
(Figure 2B). For this reason, it is crucial to maximise
ONT-only accuracy (using high ONT depth, R10.4.1 pores, ‘super’ basecalling
and Medaka polishing) to minimise the number of errors left
for short-read polishing to fix. Additionally, mate-pair Illumina sequencing may
enable Polypolish to fix errors within repeat sequences by reducing
the number of ambiguous short-read alignments39.
