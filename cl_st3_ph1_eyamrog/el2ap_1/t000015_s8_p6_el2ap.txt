Against this array of challenges, this paper seeks to bring
to light how editors, publishers, and researchers around the world,
and especially in the Global South, have taken advantage of
an open source publishing platform to create, against Altbach’s odds,
“an effective scholarly publishing enterprise.” The scale of this enterprise
will be mapped across the principal dimensions of scholarly publishing:
(a) country and region, (b) language, (c) discipline, and (d)
indexing. By counting those whose research has too often been
discounted, this paper demonstrates the extent to which scholarly publishing
in the Global South is shifting the assumed center to
“a multiplicity of spheres.” This is enriching what is thought
of as “the literature” across the disciplines, although its full
generative potential for research is only beginning to be recognized
and realized.
