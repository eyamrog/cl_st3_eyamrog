Locating our research with Timorese migrants in Northern Ireland within
the new sociolinguistics of multilingualism, we combine this duality of
focus on the social processes of mobility and mooring with
an account of the ways in which language, and other
semiotic resources (KRESS, 2010), are drawn upon in the process
of mooring. We are focusing, in particular, on the creation
of spaces of solidarity and conviviality in local life worlds,
on the construction of new identities and new forms of
belonging in those spaces and on diverse representations, on and
offline, of what it means to be Timorese, well beyond
the borders of Timor-Leste. We use the term “lifeworld” proposed
by Habermas (1987) to refer to spaces beyond institutional worlds.
We use the terms “spaces of conviviality” in a broad
sense, including the everyday meaning of “spaces where we do
things together in enjoyable ways”, and also including the meaning
proposed by Gilroy (2004), in his reflections on the potential
for conviviality in some contemporary urban settings where people of
different origins live side by side, where differences are rendered
banal, and where cultural resources come to be shared and/or
blended across generations.
