For distance education in extensive territories, such as Brazil, however,
locus procedures may be time- and resources-consuming, which can be
solved using ICT for data gathering as proposed in this
paper. The next two sections present a contextual TSA for
the design of an online CEAP course for Brazilian computer
science graduate students. Special attention will be given to the
use of ICT for data gathering and how it has
facilitated the investigation of critical issues at a distance.
