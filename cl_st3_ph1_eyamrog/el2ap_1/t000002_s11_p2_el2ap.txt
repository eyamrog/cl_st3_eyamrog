Crotty (1998) argues that a research conceptualisation should entail four
elements: epistemology, theoretical perspective, methodology, and methods. Taber (2013) considers
similar elements when referring to ontological and epistemological assumptions in
research: theoretical perspective, methodology, research design, and the coherent employment
of techniques for acquiring and analysing data.
