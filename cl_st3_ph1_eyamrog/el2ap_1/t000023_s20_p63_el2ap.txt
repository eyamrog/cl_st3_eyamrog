Note: According to Bicudo et al. (2019), Cosmarium trilobulatum var.
abscissum differs from the typical variety in its broader lateral
lobes and a wide apical lobe, matching with the present
specimens examined. This variety is similar to Cosmarium pseudoretusum F.Ducellier,
but differs by having less prominent apex.
