Earlier studies of what we are calling JUOJS (journals using
OJS) located 9,828 journals in 2015 (Alperin, Stranack, Garnett, 2016).
A survey of 2,114 of JUOJS staff members found 97.8%
of them to be open access (OA), with 13.6% utilizing
Article Processing Charges (APC) to provide OA (Alperin, Stranack &
Hanson, 2017; see also Edgar & Willinsky, 2010). These results
suggest that 84.2% of the JUOJS are “OA diamond” (which
neither charge authors nor readers for access). This result can
be compared to a more recent study which placed JUOJS
at 60% of OA diamond journals, among “at least 17,000,
but likely up to 29,000, OA diamond journals” (Bosman et
al., 2021, p. 93). Of relevance to this paper’s section
on indexing, Bosman and coauthors conclude that “even though they
are well embedded in academic structures, OA diamond journals struggle
to be properly integrated into the ecosystem of scholarly publications”
(p. 84).
