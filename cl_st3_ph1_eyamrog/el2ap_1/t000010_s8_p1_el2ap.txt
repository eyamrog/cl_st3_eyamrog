The influence of culture and education on the results of
neuropsychological tests has been noted for several years, especially the
variability between culturally different groups in functions such as language,
memory, visuospatial skills and intelligence (Fog, 2021). The variability of
results in neuropsychological tests is an important indicator to be
considered in the scientific community due to the relationship it
has with the validity and standardization of the tests, with
the effective classification of neuropsychological alterations and with the therapeutic
and educational approach in countries with many immigrants such as
the United States and the European Community (Mercado et al.,
2019).
