Doebel (2020), taking as a reference the analysis of Miyake
et al. (2000), states that in the executive functions three
basic cognitive functions are distinguished: inhibitory control, working memory and
cognitive flexibility, from which the higher executive functions such as
planning and problem solving are derived (Zelazo, 2020). From this
classification, the visual selective attention subtest would be the task
that could cause the least doubt in this factor; however,
the subtests matrices, story comprehension, graphomotor skills and counting quantities
have a common element: planning and problem solving, which in
turn includes cognitive flexibility and working memory.
