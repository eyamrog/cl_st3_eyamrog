Another consideration is length: how long must the ONT reads
be? N50 length is a commonly used metric: the length-weighted
median10. To ensure a complete assembly, the read set should
have an N50 length greater than the longest repeat sequence.
For many bacterial genomes, this is the rRNA operon, which
is ~5 kbp and usually present in multiple copies11, making
an ONT read N50 of ~20 kbp a good target.
In rare cases where the genome has an unusually long
repeat (see Pitfalls), ultra-long DNA extraction protocols may be necessary12.
