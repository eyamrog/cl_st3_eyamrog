The literature review has revealed that researchers have mainly concentrated
on how emotions are regulated in terms of teachers' emotion
regulation, thus neglecting what emotions are regulated and why regulation
occurs. Therefore, far too little is known about what specific
emotions are activated in the classroom in different situations. Furthermore,
most research has focused primarily on intrapersonal dimensions, not considering
interpersonal and contextual factors associated with teachers' emotion regulation. The
consequences of emotion regulation and the chaining of strategies have
not been adequately addressed by the literature either. According to
Frield et al. (2015), more research still needs to deal
with the dynamics and contextual nature of emotion regulation in
an educational context. These are some of the issues that
motivated the present study. In this regard, the research question
is: how do teachers in vocational and technological education regulate
their emotions in the face of the diverse emotional demands
of the classroom? This study aimed to characterize the emotional
work of the vocational and technological education teachers by examining
the emotions and the emotional regulation strategies they adopt in
the face of the emotional demands of the classroom.
