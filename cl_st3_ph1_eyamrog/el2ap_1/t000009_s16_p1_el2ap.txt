Although the language of instruction in Brazilian universities is Portuguese,
because of globalization, students have been required to read and
write in English - the academic lingua franca (Ferreira &
Lousada, 2016). Applicants to computer science graduate programs from most
public universities in the country, for example, need to pass
an English proficiency exam which tests their reading comprehension of
academic texts. Moreover, once admitted to the program, graduates must
publish at least one paper in high-impact journals to get
their post- graduation degree (Vieira, 2015a). Despite that, few institutions
offer English writing courses for the development of studentsâ€™ academic
literacy (Aranha, 2009). To provide an accessible way for these
learners to get prepared for academic writing communication, online CEAP
courses have been proposed.
