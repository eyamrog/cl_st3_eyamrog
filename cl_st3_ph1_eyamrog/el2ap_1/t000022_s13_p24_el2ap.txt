It seems likely that the degree of international collaboration by
Brazilian researchers in these mainstream journals is affected by this
countryâ€™s linguistic isolation within Latin America and its growing tendency
to publish in English, as well as its internationalization policies
prioritizing the North America and Europe. Meanwhile, for Spanish-speaking Latin
American authors, there is a more sustained tradition of intra-regional
collaboration. Based on the OLIVA corpus, it can be said
that Brazilian authors collaborate more with each other, while Argentines,
Mexicans and Chileans work more regularly with colleagues from other
countries in the region. However, it is important to mention
that authors from Brazil represent an important proportion as co-authors
of their colleagues in journals edited in other countries. For
example, of the segment of articles with authors from Argentina
with international collaboration (n=3,906), there is also at least one
author from Brazil in 26.5% of the cases. In collaborative
papers with authors from Chile (n=5,376), co-authorship with Brazil is
found in 19% of the articles. In the case of
Colombia (n=6,729) co-authorship with Brazil reaches 16.6% of the articles.
Clearly, national collaboration for Brazilians appears dominant when analyzed for
the journals edited in Brazil, yet they have a significant
participation in the co-authorship of articles published in other countries.
We will further explore the mapping of international collaboration in
the OLIVA database in subsequent studies, especially to determine the
balance between intra-regional and extra-regional collaboration, by discipline and by
country. It will be worth exploring deeper whether authors from
Brazil tend to collaborate with colleagues from outside the region
to a greater extent than with authors from Spanish-speaking countries
depending on the recognition of the journal.
