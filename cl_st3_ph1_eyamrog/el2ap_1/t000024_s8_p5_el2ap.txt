Many species of epiphytic bromeliads absorb nutrients not only through
aerial parts but also through roots (Nievola & Mercier1996) since
they show efficient growth in nurseries to be commercialised in
pots with a substrate (Negrelle et al. 2011). Therefore, ground
relocation may be a viable strategy. Some studies have shown
success in relocating bromeliads in soil, on tree trunks, or
in both conditions in the same community, regardless of their
life strategy (Freitas et al. 1998, Benzing 2000, Ara√∫jo 2006).
However, no studies have hitherto compared the efficiency of the
simultaneous relocation of bromeliads as epiphytes on trees and as
terricolous in the same crown projection area of the same
tree. In this way, it would be possible to relocate
a larger number of specimens on the same day, optimising
the process in the field and reducing the labour and
operational cost.
