Comparisons between countries with different population sizes require the use
of rates standardized to population figures. However, in the context
of Covid-19, several demographers [Goldstein & Lee, 2020; Heuveline &
Tzen, 2021; Queiroz et al., 2020] have argued that per
capita rates alone are insufficient for many analytical purposes, including
the assessment of national responses to the pandemic. This limitation
is particularly evident given the substantial variation in Covid-19 case-fatality
rates by age, as demonstrated in a study analyzing data
from 45 countries, which found that case-fatality rates ranged from
0.001% among individuals aged 5 to 9 years to 8.29%
among those aged 80 years or older [O'Driscoll et al.,
2021: 142]. Additionally, significant differences exist in the age structures
of national populations. For example, although Pakistan's total population is
approximately 22 times larger than that of Portugal, the number
of individuals aged 90 years or older is higher in
Portugal than in Pakistan, illustrating the extent of demographic variation
between countries.
