As reported in previous studies (Bruscato & Baptista, 2022a, 2022b),
native speakers of English are not influenced by clause order
or anaphor salience and typically interpret the anaphor as referring
to the subject of the main clause. In contrast, learners
do not exhibit a consistent interpretive preference and generally display
uncertainty, with the exception of advanced Brazilian learners, who tend
to interpret a stressed pronoun in the subject position of
the subordinate clause as referring to the complement of the
main clause, and Portuguese learners, who tend to interpret non-emphatic
pronominal cataphora as referring to the subject of the main
clause.
