Significant organizational restructuring has occurred at the Institute for K
during the Bolsonaro administration, and this process is ongoing. The
replacement of superintendents with extensive experience—some with 30 to 40
years of involvement in policy K—by individuals without comparable qualifications,
such as filmmakers and associates of members of Congress, has
been reported. Several directors have also been dismissed in recent
months. According to the interviewee, these actions constitute a systematic
and observable dismantling of the institution, affecting personnel at all
levels. The interviewee emphasizes that these changes appear to lack
a coherent or articulated policy project, which is a primary
concern. Rather than reflecting the implementation of a new, democratically
mandated agenda, the changes are perceived as an effort to
dismantle existing structures without a clear alternative, as evidenced by
recent developments at the Institute for K (interviewee 35).
