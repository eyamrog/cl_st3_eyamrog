ethical deliberation and social integration occur. Therefore, since ethical inquiry
is inherently grounded in a specific level of historical understanding
that is synthesized within a cultural tradition, independent schools—such as
those inspected by Ofsted in 2014 and 2015—should not be
exempt from engaging with the principal traditional canons of their
societies, encompassing scientific, moral, and religious perspectives. In the context
of gender relations, it is essential to recognize that a
minimal set of normative principles is required to enable meaningful
discursive practices. While citizens may legitimately debate the interdependence of
gender roles, question the concept of sameness, or critique the
sexualization of women in sports and the workplace, legal norms
that restrict women’s access to education, fundamental rights, or opportunities
for self-expression are incompatible with these principles. Such restrictive normative
frameworks undermine the processes of instruction and communication that are
necessary for ethical deliberation and the functioning of a pluralistic
society.
