Analysis of the event setting may help explain the high
infection rate, with one in four attendees testing positive for
SARS-CoV-2. Among the 164 attendees, 86.4% reported being present for
two or more hours, 82.9% spent most of their time
in an enclosed, non-ventilated environment, and 87.8% neither used face
masks nor practiced social distancing. High-volume music was continuously played
in the indoor, non-ventilated area, likely increasing the risk of
transmission due to elevated vocal effort and consequent higher aerosol
emissions (Kopechek, 2020; Bergwerk et al., 2021). Of the 41
individuals who tested positive for COVID-19, 37 (90.3%) attended the
event for more than two hours, remained in the enclosed
environment throughout, and none used face masks at any time.
The only preventive measure implemented was a rapid antigen test
conducted 24 hours before the event; however, two individuals who
tested positive still attended. Of these, one was vaccinated and
reported consistent mask use, while the other was unvaccinated and
did not use a mask. This superspreading event highlights insufficient
risk assessment and reluctance to implement multiple protective measures. The
findings indicate that reliance on a single intervention, such as
pre-event antigen testing, was inadequate to reduce infection risk. Consistent
with the Swiss Cheese Model (Perneger, 2005; Azuma et al.,
2020), which emphasizes the necessity of multiple layers of protection
due to the limitations of individual measures, the absence of
comprehensive mitigation strategies—including restricting entry to negative individuals, ensuring adequate
ventilation, universal mask use, reduced music volume, and social distancing—contributed
to the occurrence of this superspreading event.
