Following the impeachment process—referred to by some as a coup—numerous
federal employees either exited federal service or transferred to other
institutions. Some individuals cited their unwillingness to cooperate with what
they regarded as an illegitimate government as the primary reason
for their departure. In contrast, others chose to remain in
their positions to ensure continuity in the implementation of existing
policies. As indicated by the data below, only 29% of
all respondents retained the same positions and institutional affiliations between
the 2016 impeachment process and the 2018 elections.
