As indicated in the findings, course interactions demonstrate that the
interpretation of emojis varies according to the context in which
they are used. For example, the wink emoji may sometimes
be perceived as minimizing the impact of an intervention, while
in other instances it may simply convey agreement or acknowledgment.
Emojis frequently function as non-verbal communication tools that compensate for
the absence of gestures typically present in face-to-face interactions, thereby
facilitating interpersonal proximity and supporting group cohesion. In this regard,
emojis can be considered agents in the construction of meaning
(Paiva, 2016). Their use in digital educational environments appears to
have several pedagogical implications, including fostering community engagement, enhancing group
cohesion, supporting task management, enabling non-verbal communication, and influencing language
use. As discussed, the use of emojis may contribute to
participant engagement and the development of a sense of belonging
within the community, as well as help maintain community cohesion.
Additionally, emojis can assist in keeping participants focused on tasks
and in providing immediate feedback on pedagogical activities. Another implication
is that emojis can partially compensate for the lack of
visual cues that are typically available in face-to-face communication. However,
the frequent use of single-line emoji responses—where only emojis are
used to interact or respond to tasks—may present challenges in
educational contexts, particularly in language learning, as written interactions are
essential for information exchange, negotiation of meaning, and language development.
