The percentages of oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in
the flasks were measured using a gas analyser (model ILL6600,
Illinois Instruments, Inc., Johnsburg, IL, USA) following the method described
by Lamarca and Barbedo (2012). These measurements enable an indirect
evaluation of respiratory activity by calculating the rates of O2
consumption and CO2 release. The percentage values of O2 and
CO2 were converted to partial pressures using the equation p1/P
= v1/V, where p1 is the partial pressure of the
gas (atm), P is the local atmospheric pressure (0.9 atm),
v1 is the gas volume percentage, and V is the
total volume (100%) (Atkins & De Paula 2001). Subsequently, the
partial pressure values were converted to micromoles of O2 and
CO2 using the ideal gas law, p1V = nRT, where
V is the total volume of air in the flasks
(L), n is the number of moles of gas, R
is the universal gas constant (0.082 atm L mol⁻¹ K⁻¹),
and T is the temperature in Kelvin (Atkins & De
Paula 2001).
