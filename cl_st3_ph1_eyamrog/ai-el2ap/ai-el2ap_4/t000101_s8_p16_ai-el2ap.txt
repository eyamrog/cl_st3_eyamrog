The conservative discourse surrounding public service often characterizes the bureaucracy
as unproductive, overcompensated, and resistant to change. In the education
literature, teachers and their unions are frequently depicted as impediments
to educational reform (Moe, 2016). Conversely, public administration scholarship has
demonstrated that bureaucrats possess decision-making autonomy (Lipsky, 2010) and may
resist directives from higher authorities when such orders conflict with
their personal values, a phenomenon described by Oâ€™Leary (2014) as
'guerrilla government.' In this context, Guedes-Neto and Peters (2021) conducted
an empirical investigation using experimental methods to assess whether Brazilian
civil servants would comply with, neglect, or actively undermine (Brehm
& Gates, 1999) instructions to implement undemocratic projects. Their study,
which involved municipal civil servants from two state capitals in
Brazil, found that when confronted with hypothetical undemocratic initiatives, most
municipal-level bureaucrats indicated a preference for shirking.
