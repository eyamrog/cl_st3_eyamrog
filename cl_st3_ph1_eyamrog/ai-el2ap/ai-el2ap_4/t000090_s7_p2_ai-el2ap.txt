Several prominent international academic rankings have been developed and widely
discussed in the literature (Calderón, França, and Gonçalves, 2017; Calderón
and França, 2018; Dill and Soo, 2005; Eccles, 2002; Ganga-Contreras
et al., 2020). These rankings began to emerge in the
early 21st century and have gained increasing prominence over time.
Currently, they are regarded as significant by the majority of
academic institutions worldwide. High placement in these rankings is often
perceived as an indicator of institutional quality, which can enhance
an institution’s reputation and competitiveness in the global higher education
sector. Furthermore, the study of academic rankings has itself become
a distinct area of research, as evidenced by the substantial
volume of related scholarly publications (Billaut, Bouyssou, and Vinke, 2010;
Calderón and França, 2018; Gonçalves and Calderón, 2017; Herting, 2016;
Liu and Cheng, 2005; Marginson and van der Wende, 2007;
Bernhard, 2012; Shin et al., 2011; Sorz et al., 2015;
Stack, 2016; van Raan, 2005; Webster, 2001; Aguillo et al.,
2010; Aguillo et al., 2006; Théry, 2020).
