In this study, 10 μL of serum and three drops
of buffer solution were added to the reaction well of
the test device in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The
sample was drawn into the device by capillary action and
mixed with the SARS-CoV-2 antigen-dye conjugate, which then migrated through
the pre-coated membrane. If the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in
the sample met or exceeded the assay's minimum detection limit,
the antibodies bound to the antigen-dye conjugate were subsequently captured
by the immobilized human anti-IgG antibody and anti-μ-chain antibody complex
in the test region. This interaction resulted in the formation
of a colored test band, which was interpreted as a
positive result.
