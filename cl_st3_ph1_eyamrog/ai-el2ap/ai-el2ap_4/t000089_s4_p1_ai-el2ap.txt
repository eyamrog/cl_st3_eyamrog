Throughout this article, I have critically examined the assumption that
an impartial and neutralist approach to Religious Education (RE) is
either possible or desirable, by highlighting the relationship between the
scientific object and the rational subject, and arguing that observers
are influenced by their own historical contexts and epistemic frameworks
when selecting and evaluating evidence. Furthermore, I have shown that
multidenominational models of RE which exclude critical engagement with the
substantive truth and moral claims of religious belief systems fail
to recognize the potential of these conceptual resources to facilitate
emancipatory changes in perception. While the objective of RE is
not to lead students to any predetermined conclusions regarding the
value of religious content in schools, it does support the
development of critical capacities that enable individuals to make informed
choices independently.
