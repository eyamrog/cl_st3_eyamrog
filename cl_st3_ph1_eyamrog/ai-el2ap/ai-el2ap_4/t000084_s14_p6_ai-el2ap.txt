This study examines the relationship between participantsâ€™ attitudes and their
use of emojis to support cognitive, teaching, and social presences
during the course conducted via WhatsApp. Specifically, it investigates whether
positive or negative attitudes toward emoji use are associated with
the frequency and manner in which emojis are employed to
facilitate knowledge construction (cognitive presence), instructional support (teaching presence), and
