Since U-Multirank utilizes a substantially larger number of indicators (36)
compared to one-dimensional rankings, which typically employ fewer than 15
indicators, the potential for missing data is correspondingly higher and
may be considered a limitation of this ranking system. However,
this issue is less critical than in one-dimensional rankings because
U-Multirank does not produce an overall classification; users can disregard
missing data and focus on the available information, thereby losing
only part of the dataset rather than the entire ranking.
Nevertheless, the extent of missing data is significant in many
cases, and this issue will be examined in detail later
in the present paper.
