Adjusting COVID-19 mortality rates to account for variations in population
age structure necessitates the use of data on the total
population (P) and the cumulative number of deaths (M), each
disaggregated by age group. These data enable the calculation of
both the crude mortality rate (m) and an age-adjusted mortality
rate (a), the latter standardized to a uniform age distribution.
