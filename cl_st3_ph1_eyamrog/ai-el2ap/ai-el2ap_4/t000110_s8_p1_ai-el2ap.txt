The Holocene is the most recent interval of Earthâ€™s history,
extending to the present day. Along with the Pleistocene, it
constitutes the Quaternary period and is considered one of the
most intensively studied intervals of recent geological time (Suguio, 1999).
Although the Holocene represents a relatively short geological period, its
sedimentary records are well preserved, allowing for direct comparison with
analogous data from contemporary processes (Walker & Geissman, 2009).
