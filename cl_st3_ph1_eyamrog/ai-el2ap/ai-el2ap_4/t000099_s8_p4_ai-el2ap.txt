NS induce shoot formation from axillary bud meristems, which are
activated following the disruption of apical dominance resulting from the
isolation of the node from the mother plant (George et
al., 2008). However, there is a lack of studies investigating
respiration during in vitro plantlet development from lateral buds and
its comparison to respiration during seed germination.
