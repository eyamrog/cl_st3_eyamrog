The assumption of “common links” among various religious values and
experiences across different traditions suggests an interpretation of Religious Education
(RE) practices as mechanisms for advancing predetermined secular objectives, particularly
the promotion of cultural diversity. This perspective frames diverse religious
expressions as distinct yet equally valuable contributors to the cultivation
of public virtues and the reinforcement of social cohesion through
the establishment of new interpersonal relationships. Notably, this approach contrasts
with the Introduction to the Primary School Curriculum (1999), which
emphasizes the spiritual dimension of life as a pursuit of
truth and a search for transcendence within human experience (United
Kingdom, 1999, p. 27). The Learn Together curriculum, by comparison,
does not explicitly link critical thinking to the pursuit of
truth, as the term “truth” is absent from the document.
While the curriculum incorporates concepts such as reflective thinking and
critical knowledge, it adopts a cautious stance regarding religious truth
and moral inquiry. Instead, it appears to presuppose that principles
of equality and human rights constitute the foundational basis of
all educational initiatives. This position is further illustrated by Paul
Rowe, CEO of Educate Together, who, in his article “The
Religious Void in Irish Education” (2016), critiques religious educationalists who
argue that the lack of strong denominational formation would result
in a “moral vacuum.”
