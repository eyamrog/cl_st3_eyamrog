All civil servants from my former department transferred to other
departments. I arranged my own transfer to a different area,
although it did not align with my personal interests; however,
this was the only available option at the time. I
continuously sought a position where it would be feasible to
maintain professional stability. My decision to move was primarily motivated
by the pursuit of a work environment that would allow
me to perform my duties with a sense of dignity
