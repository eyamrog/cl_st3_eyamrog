Despite the overall homogeneity of benthic macrofauna assemblages among the
three sampling sites, the cluster analysis revealed some minor distinctions.
Specifically, replicates generally exhibited high similarity, while the sampling sites
themselves displayed subtle differences, as illustrated in Figure 2. The
underlying causes of these differences remain unclear and may be
associated with natural factors, such as hydrogeochemical characteristics, or anthropogenic
influences, including pollution or trampling.
