This study introduces an agent-based model, AbCSim, designed to simulate
the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic at the local city
level. The model explicitly integrates multiple epidemiological factors, enabling its
adaptation to diverse case studies. Detailed methodologies for parameter calibration,
as well as for incorporating temporal changes in social distancing
measures, population activities, and climatic conditions, are presented. The model
was applied to the city of Paran√° as a case
study, focusing on the second half of 2020.
