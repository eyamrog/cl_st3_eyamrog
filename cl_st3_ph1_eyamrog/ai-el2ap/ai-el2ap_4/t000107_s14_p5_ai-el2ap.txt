Consequently, two additional websites were included in this study: the
Biblioteca Digital de Teses e Dissertações (BDTD; Digital Library of
Dissertations and Theses) and the Catálogo de Teses e Dissertações
da CAPES (CAPES Dissertations and Theses Catalog). Both platforms are
designed to provide access to and increase the visibility of
Brazilian theses and dissertations. The BDTD is managed by the
Brazilian Institute of Information in Science and Technology. Its homepage
features a simplified keyword search interface with four filter options—todos
os campos (all fields), título (title), autor (author), and assunto
(topic) (Figure 2)—as well as an advanced search function that
offers a broader range of filters (Figure 3).
