The neutralist-liberal conception of Religious Education (RE) is defined by
its emphasis on impartiality, which is understood to be achieved
when the educational process is conducted in an "objective, critical,
and pluralistic" manner, in line with the normative principles endorsed
by the European Court of Human Rights (Folger√∏ v. Norway,
2007; Hasan and Eylem Zengin v. Turkey, 2008; Lautsi v.
Italy, 2011). This perspective is based on the assumption that
a neutral, independent standpoint of reason exists and serves as
the foundation for normative values and scientific standards within educational
contexts. Implicit in this approach is a secular understanding of
public morality and a formal conception of the educational process
that distinguishes cognitive knowledge from its practical application.
