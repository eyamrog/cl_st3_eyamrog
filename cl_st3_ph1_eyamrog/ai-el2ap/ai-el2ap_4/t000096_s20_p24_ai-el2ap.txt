Human beings, as active agents, must be prepared to adapt
to the frequent changes occurring within society. This need is
heightened by the exponential growth of information across various formats,
including oral, written, multimedia, and audiovisual forms. Such developments necessitate
information literacy, which encompasses the abilities to search for, select,
analyze, and transform information into knowledge (Area & Guarro, 2012).
These are fundamental competencies that form part of the broader
set of skills required to achieve multiliteracy among citizens in
the information society (Mart√≠nez-Abad, 2013, p. 38).
