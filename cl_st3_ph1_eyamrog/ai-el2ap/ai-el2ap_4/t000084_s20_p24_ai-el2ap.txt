To examine the effect of gender on emoji use, four
independent samples t-tests were conducted with gender as the independent
variable and emoji use for each type of presence as
the dependent variable. Among the 61 survey participants, 39 identified
as female, 21 as male, and one did not specify
a gender. For cognitive presence, female participants (M = 10.13,
SD = 14.30) reported slightly higher emoji use compared to
male participants (M = 8.00, SD = 8.38); however, this
difference was not statistically significant, t(58) = 0.63, p =
0.53 (see Tables 8 and 9).
