General characteristics of the study population are presented using frequencies
and percentages for categorical variables, and means with standard deviations
(SD) for continuous variables. The population was divided into two
cohorts: vaccinated and unvaccinated. The vaccinated cohort included individuals who
had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine
at the time of the event, while the unvaccinated cohort
comprised individuals who had not received any vaccine doses. Additionally,
the number of adolescents who were fully vaccinated, defined as
having received all recommended doses more than 14 days prior
to the event, and those who were partially vaccinated, is
reported.
