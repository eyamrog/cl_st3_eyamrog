Since the early days of the pandemic, international collaborative efforts
have been undertaken to collect indicators for monitoring its spread.
Data on the number of cases, deaths, and recoveries are
systematically tracked, both as daily figures and as cumulative totals.
However, issues related to the accuracy of this information, as
well as significant international discrepancies in data quality, render case
counts unsuitable for cross-country comparisons. Variations in testing availability—particularly pronounced
during the initial stages of the pandemic—further undermine the comparability
of case-based indicators. While the impact of COVID-19 extends beyond
outcomes resulting in death, mortality data, despite their own limitations,
offer a more reliable basis for comparative analysis.
