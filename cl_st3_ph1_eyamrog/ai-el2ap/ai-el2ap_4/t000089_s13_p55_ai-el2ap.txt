As noted by Mawhinney (2007) and Fischer (2016), the Irish
educational system demonstrates significant limitations regarding democratic pluralism due to
its dependence on denominational schools to provide public education. This
reliance leads to discriminatory enrolment policies and the enforcement of
specific religious ethos. Parents of children with differing religious or
secular backgrounds are not afforded equitable opportunities for school choice
and their children are often subjected to a unidirectional process
of religious instruction. Consequently, liberal critiques of current state policies
are justified to some extent, as these policies, while not
necessarily violating European human rights laws, do not fulfill the
standards of communicative rationality.
