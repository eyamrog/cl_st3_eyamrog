The combination of visuals depicting the girl with both of
her fathers, as well as those showing her engaged in
activities with only one father, suggests that each father may
have a distinct role in her life. Both fathers are
afforded equal prominence in the narrative and in the girl's
experiences, as evidenced by their equal representation across the visual
themes (see Section 3). Nevertheless, it is notable that "Dad"
is the first to be mentioned in the written text
and occupies the most prominent position in the visuals upon
his initial appearance. Additionally, the depiction of "Dad" participating in
more activities with Emily than "Daddy" further emphasizes his role
within the story.
