The second highest correlation coefficient is observed between “Research publications
(absolute numbers)” and “Research publications (size-normalized),” with a value of
0.6953, which is at the threshold for classification as a
“strong” correlation. This indicates that the rankings based on total
publications and those based on publications per faculty member are
similar, though not identical. Publications per faculty member may serve
as a more appropriate metric for comparison, as it accounts
for differences in institutional size; however, the overall results derived
from both indicators do not differ substantially.
