Among the resources capable of facilitating knowledge generation in various
contexts are Personal Learning Environments (PLEs), which are designed to
challenge traditional educational structures within training institutions and promote self-directed
learning tailored to individual students' interests and needs (Llorente &
Cabero, 2012). Furthermore, Rus-Casas et al. (2021) report that the
implementation of PLEs supports the achievement of sustainable learning objectives,
including information management and organization, collaborative work, and the integration
of knowledge (p. 13).
