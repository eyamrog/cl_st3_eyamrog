Spanish learners tend to interpret ellipsis in the subject position
of subordinate clauses as referring to the subject of the
main clause, a pattern observed particularly among Brazilian participants in
cases of zero anaphora. However, participants did not demonstrate a
consistent preference for the antecedent of the pronoun. The alternative
"other" was selected only in instances of pronominal cataphora, and
this occurred exclusively among native speakers and advanced Portuguese learners.
Notably, the two groups of European Portuguese speakers exhibited opposite
patterns in their responses to pronominal cataphora, with intermediate learners
displaying results more similar to native speakers than to advanced
learners. It should be noted that the group sizes varied
considerably, with the intermediate group consisting of only four participants.
