Clinical trials have demonstrated that valerian exhibits sedative and hypnotic
effects when administered at doses ranging from 400 to 900
mg, 30 to 60 minutes prior to bedtime. Additionally, in
contrast to benzodiazepines, valerian extracts did not impair voluntary movement
or speech coordination and were not associated with the development
of physical or psychological dependence (Pakseresht et al., 2011).
