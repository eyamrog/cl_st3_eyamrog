This mixed-methods research project began in the summer of 2019,
six months after Jair Bolsonaro assumed the Brazilian presidency. Data
collection occurred over a two-year period and utilized a snowball
sampling survey involving 337 former and current federal employees, of
whom 129 participated in semi-structured interviews lasting between one and
one and a half hours. Participants were asked about their
personal trajectories and career decisions, but were not directly questioned
about policy dismantling. The data presented reflect information that respondents
voluntarily disclosed to the research team during interviews. All interviews
were coded and analyzed using NVivo software.
