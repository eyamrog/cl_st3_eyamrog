The rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical severity of
COVID-19 pose significant diagnostic challenges, necessitating the use of methods
capable of excluding current infection, confirming recent infection, identifying past
infections, and evaluating the immune response. Accurate assessment of viral
prevalence is essential to inform the implementation of appropriate containment
measures [8,9]. As most patients develop detectable antibodies only during
the second week after symptom onset, the World Health Organization
does not recommend the use of rapid antibody tests for
SARS-CoV-2 in routine clinical practice [23,24]. Nevertheless, these tests are
valuable in population-based studies, as they facilitate the identification of
previous exposure to the virus and provide data on the
distribution and characteristics of individuals who have been infected, thereby
indicating regions with higher viral circulation [8,9]. Immunochromatographic tests for
antibody detection are cost-effective and simple to administer, enabling frequent
testing and supporting efforts to limit disease spread; however, they
should not be used as substitutes for reference diagnostic methods
such as RT-PCR [8-10,25]. A review of the effectiveness of
immunochromatographic antibody tests in seroprevalence surveys demonstrated a marked increase
in diagnostic accuracy over the first three weeks following symptom
onset, with sensitivities of 30% in the first week, 70%
in the second week, and over 90% in the third
week, and reported a low false-positive rate of 2% [8].
Additionally, immunochromatographic serology tests exhibit higher diagnostic sensitivity when performed
with serum or plasma samples compared to other sample types
[26].
