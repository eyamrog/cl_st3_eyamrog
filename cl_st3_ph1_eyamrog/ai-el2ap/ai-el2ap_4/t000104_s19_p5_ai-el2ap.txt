In the preliminary analysis by replicate, P3C and P2C had
the highest numbers of individuals sampled; however, replicate P1A exhibited
the greatest number of taxonomic groups (10), whereas P3B contained
only 3 groups. Pielou's equitability index (J) values at each
sampling site indicated that more than 77% of the maximum
possible diversity was present in each sample, with minimal variation
among them. The Shannon diversity index varied between replicates, but
the mean values for each sample were 2.13, 2.16, and
2.12, respectively (Table 4), indicating that the assemblages were relatively
homogeneous across the three sampling sites. Margaleff richness values for
individual replicates ranged from 0.83 at P3B to 3.11 at
P1A. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed no significant differences in
ecological indices (diversity, richness, and evenness) among samples. The observed
high diversity, richness, and equitability are indicative of good water
quality in the Itinguçu River, particularly at the Cachoeira do
Paraíso waterfall.
