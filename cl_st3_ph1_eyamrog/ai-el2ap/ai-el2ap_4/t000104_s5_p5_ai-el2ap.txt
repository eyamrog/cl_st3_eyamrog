The order Diptera comprises several species that are commonly found
in contaminated aquatic environments, including those affected by sewage discharge
and stagnant water in urban areas (Fagundes and Shimizu, 1997).
Previous studies have reported higher densities of Diptera in degraded
environments, which is attributed to elevated levels of organic matter
(Oliveira et al., 2010; Machado et al., 2015). However, in
the case of the Itingu√ßu River, the predominance of first-order
opportunistic organisms is likely attributable to natural factors, such as
significant fluctuations in river flow, rather than to anthropogenic influences.
