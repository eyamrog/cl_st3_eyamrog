This paper aims to contribute to the experimental findings of
Guedes-Neto and Peters (2021) by further examining the behavior of
civil servants under varying political pressures. While civil servants may
demonstrate a tendency to resist participation in undemocratic projects, their
capacity or willingness to do so may diminish when subjected
to authoritarian pressure. The incidence of shirking and sabotage within
the bureaucracy may decrease either due to heightened fear or
when opportunities for exit, in its various forms, are accessible.
