In March 2020, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which caused the
COVID-19 outbreak, infected over 270,000 individuals globally and resulted in
more than 11,300 deaths [1]. Epidemiological analyses of various outbreaks
worldwide have facilitated the development of several models, primarily mathematical,
to monitor and predict the spread of epidemics [2][3][4][5]. Within
this context, the present study aims to offer an alternative
approach that incorporates a broader range of real-world factors and
enables the prediction of the effects of different social and
health policies.
