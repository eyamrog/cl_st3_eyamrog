This pragmatist perspective tends to underestimate the role of truth
in guiding the dialogical process, thereby confining social groups within
their specific worldviews and limiting the potential for expanding cultural
horizons. Additionally, by redirecting the moral significance of religious meanings
to immanent realities that no longer reference the metaphysical realm,
this approach does not adequately address possible solutions to fundamental
normative disagreements. The conception of truth advanced in this study
is informed by Jürgen Habermas’s (2003) theory of communicative rationality,
which posits that democratic consensus is constituted by moral claims
analogous to truth, insofar as individuals can evaluate their validity
according to a conception of universal justice. Although democratic deliberation
remains inherently open-ended, individuals are nonetheless required to adopt a
definitive stance—affirmative or negative—on divergent truth and moral claims that
may challenge their existing worldview.
