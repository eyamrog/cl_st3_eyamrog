Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that unvaccinated susceptible
adolescents exhibited a higher incidence of COVID-19 compared to their
vaccinated counterparts. However, among those who became infected, both unvaccinated
and vaccinated adolescents experienced similar symptoms, including fatigue, runny nose,
anosmia, fever, cough, and ageusia. No cases of reinfection were
observed among adolescents who had previously recovered from COVID-19. The
absence of infection-mitigation strategies was associated with the occurrence of
a superspreading event.
