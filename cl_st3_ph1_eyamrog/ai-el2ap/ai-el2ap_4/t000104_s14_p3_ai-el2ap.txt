The Itinguçu State Park (PEIt) encompasses an area of 5,040
hectares and is situated between the municipalities of Peruíbe and
Iguape in the state of São Paulo (São Paulo, 2013).
It is designated as a strict protection area (no-take zone),
permitting public visitation for recreational activities and, where feasible, incorporating
elements of environmental education. The park's territory includes short rivers
originating in the mountainous region and flowing toward the coast,
such as the Guaraú and Itinguçu rivers, as well as
several beaches, including Guarauzinho, Arpoador, Parnapoã, Brava, and Juquiazinho (Magini
& Abessa, 2017). PEIt is divided into two main sections,
Arpoador and Itinguçu, both of which are characterized by Atlantic
Dense Rainforest; additionally, the Arpoador section contains mangrove and restinga
forest ecosystems.
