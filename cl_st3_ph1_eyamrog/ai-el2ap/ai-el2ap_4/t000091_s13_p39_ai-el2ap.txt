The systematic literature review conducted by Ara√∫jo et al. (2021)
identified alprazolam (0.5 and 0.75 mg), midazolam (15 mg), Passiflora
incarnata (260 mg), and Valeriana officinalis (100 mg) as the
most commonly used and effective medications for managing anxiety in
dental patients. However, these medications were also frequently associated with
adverse effects, which leads some patients to decline their use
and prompts clinicians to seek alternative options. Consequently, it is
essential to perform a thorough assessment of each patient and
their anxiety level prior to treatment in order to select
the most appropriate pharmacological intervention.
