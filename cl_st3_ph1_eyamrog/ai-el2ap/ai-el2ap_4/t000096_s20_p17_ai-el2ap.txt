In the educational field, there has been a documented shift
from an information society to a knowledge society, which requires
professionals to possess both innovative capabilities and digital competence in
order to perform efficiently and effectively within the context of
lifelong learning (Tedesco, 2000). In this context, students are expected
not only to receive information but also to actively generate
knowledge.
