This paper proposes two additional rules for generating a comprehensive
ranking that incorporates all available grades. The first rule involves
calculating the simple average of all presented Indicators. While this
approach utilizes the complete dataset, it assigns equal weight to
each Indicator without accounting for the relative importance of the
different Dimensions. This is problematic because the number of Indicators
per Dimension ranges from four to eleven, resulting in certain
Dimensions exerting disproportionately greater influence on the final grade.
