The protection of rivers is essential for maintaining socioecological systems,
and benthic macroinvertebrate communities serve as effective indicators for assessing
river water quality. This study evaluated the water quality of
the Cachoeira do Paraíso waterfall in Peruíbe, SP, using benthic
macrofauna as bioindicators. Sampling was conducted at three sites subjected
to varying degrees of anthropogenic influence. Both physicochemical and sedimentological
parameters of the water were measured, and macrobenthic organisms were
collected using the kick sampling technique. Organisms were identified to
the lowest possible taxonomic level, and each group was assigned
a score based on its sensitivity or tolerance to pollutants.
A biological index was then calculated to assess water quality.
Ecological indices were also determined and compared using analysis of
variance (ANOVA). The measured physicochemical parameters were within legal standards.
Thirteen taxonomic groups of benthic macroinvertebrates were identified, and the
Shannon diversity indices indicated similar levels of taxonomic diversity across
sites. The scores assigned to each taxon produced biological indices
for each sample, which ranged from regular to excellent. Diptera
(with head) I was the most abundant taxon, and sensitive
groups were present at all sampling sites, indicating good water
quality during the study period.
