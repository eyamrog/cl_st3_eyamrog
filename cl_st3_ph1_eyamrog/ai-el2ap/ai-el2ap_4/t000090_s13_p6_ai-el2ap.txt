A detailed examination of U-Multirank reveals that indicators derived from
external sources, such as the number of publications and citations,
are available for all educational institutions and exhibit a high
degree of reliability. In contrast, information such as graduates’ place
of employment and time of graduation, which is collected through
questionnaires distributed by educational institutions and students, is not consistently
available and tends to have lower accuracy. Additionally, certain data
are classified as “Not Applicable,” for example, the number and
job location of graduates from master’s programs in institutions that
do not offer such programs.
