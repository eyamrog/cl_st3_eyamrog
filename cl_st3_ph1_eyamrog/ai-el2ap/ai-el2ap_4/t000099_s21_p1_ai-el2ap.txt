Leaf formation was first observed in seeds at 14 days
of culture, occurring simultaneously with root development (Figures 1d and
2). A similar pattern was observed for leaves of NS,
although root emergence was detected at 28 days (Figure 2).
Previous studies have reported that Acanthostachys strobilacea (Schult. & Schult.f.)
Klotzsch seedlings develop roots before leaves (Pereira 1988), whereas in
node cultures, shoot formation generally precedes root development and typically
requires the addition of hormones to the medium to induce
rooting (George et al. 2008); however, this requirement does not
apply to A. strobilacea (Santos et al. 2010, 2017).
