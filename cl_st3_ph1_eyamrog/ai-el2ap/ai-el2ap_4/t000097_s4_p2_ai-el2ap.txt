The study protocols included in this scoping review encompassed a
variety of interventions involving different modalities of physical activity and
exercise, such as endurance training, aerobic exercises, dance, Pilates, high-intensity
interval training (HIIT), Qigong, and technology-assisted activities utilizing software, applications,
or wearable devices to monitor physical activity. Intervention frequency ranged
from one to five sessions per week, with durations spanning
12 to 48 weeks and intensities classified as low to
vigorous. Most protocols targeted participants in disease stages 0 to
III, with the majority of women undergoing chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or
other adjuvant therapies during the intervention period. The primary outcomes
assessed included physical fitness, physical activity level, cognitive function, and
body composition, while quality of life, fatigue, depression, and anxiety
were the most frequently reported psychological outcomes.
