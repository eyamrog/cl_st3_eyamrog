A meta-analysis conducted by Pittler and Ernst (2003), which included
seven studies involving patients with anxiety disorders, demonstrated a significant
reduction in anxiety as measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Scale.
In contrast, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial by Sarris
et al. (2020) evaluated the efficacy of kava-kava in 171
participants diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, administering two doses of
120 mg daily. The findings indicated that this specific kava-kava
extract was not effective for the treatment of generalized anxiety
disorder. Nevertheless, evidence suggests that kava-kava may be a viable
anxiolytic option for short-term use in cases of situational anxiety,
such as anxiety experienced in dental settings, due to its
sedative properties.
