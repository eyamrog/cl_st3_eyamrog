For the descriptive analysis, absolute and percentage values of patient
characteristics were reported. The risk of death between Rio de
Janeiro and SÃ£o Paulo was estimated using logistic regression models
adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidities. Analyses were conducted at
both the state and capital levels. Missing data for all
comorbidities were treated as indicating the absence of morbidity. Two
sensitivity analyses were conducted: the first assessed potential differences in
notification rates by excluding data from November and December, and
the second evaluated the impact of missing outcome data by
assuming all missing outcomes corresponded to cured cases.
