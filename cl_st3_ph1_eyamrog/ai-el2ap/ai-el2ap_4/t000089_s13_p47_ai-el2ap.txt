In voluntary-controlled schools and community schools, the Religious Education (RE)
syllabus of each Local Education Authority (LEA) reflects official policy
concerning the communitarian dimensions of the educational process, which is
informed by an experiential approach to learning. For example, the
Birmingham Agreed Syllabus (2007) addresses local aspects of the development
of the Christian faith while also considering the diverse family
backgrounds of students in order to incorporate other religious traditions
into the RE programme, reflecting their presence within the local
community. The document consistently highlights the roles of parents, churches,
and community associations in the religious and ethical development of
pupils, and promotes an approach that encourages mutual understanding among
individuals of different faiths.
