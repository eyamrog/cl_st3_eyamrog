The values for mask usage and physical distancing in the
Interpersonal Contact submodel were determined based on the literature reviewed
in Section 4.1. As the phases of isolation and distancing
evolved, an increase in population mobility was observed, as indicated
by data from Google Mobility12. This shift in mobility towards
activities characteristic of pre-pandemic conditions is represented by corresponding changes
in the parameters of matrices A and B in the
various Hidden Markov Models (HMM) described in Appendix A.
