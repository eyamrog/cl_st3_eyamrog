The selection of valerian as an alternative to benzodiazepines was
informed by evidence of its anxiolytic and sedative properties, which
have been demonstrated in both clinical and experimental studies. Furthermore,
literature indicates that this phytotherapeutic agent is associated with a
low incidence of side effects and is generally well tolerated
by patients receiving medical care (Hadley & Petry, 2003; Pinheiro
et al., 2014; Gharib et al., 2015).
