An informational folder was affixed to the door of each
randomly selected household, notifying residents that their household had been
chosen for sample collection scheduled to occur during the upcoming
weekend. To account for potential non-response due to refusal or
absence, the same informational folder was also distributed to the
immediate neighboring households on both the left and right sides
of the selected residence (see Appendix 2).
