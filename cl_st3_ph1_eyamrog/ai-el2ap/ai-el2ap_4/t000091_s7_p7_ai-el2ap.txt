The objective of this study is to review the existing
literature and highlight the need for further research among health
professionals, particularly dental surgeons, regarding the efficacy of phytotherapeutic medications
as potential alternatives for anxiety management in dentistry. The study
aims to encourage the development of controlled clinical trials to
evaluate the safety and effectiveness of these interventions, with the
goal of identifying options that minimize adverse effects and improve
patient comfort.
