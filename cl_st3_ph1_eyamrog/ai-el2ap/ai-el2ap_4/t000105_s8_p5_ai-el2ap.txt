A population study is a valuable methodological approach for accurately
characterizing the epidemiological status of a disease across various regions.
It facilitates the assessment of disease magnitude, elucidates transmission dynamics,
and provides insights into demographic, geographic, and social patterns of
distribution. Additionally, population studies enable the development of reliable indicators
that describe infection prevalence and support the prediction of disease
risk.
