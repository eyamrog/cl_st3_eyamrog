The analysis indicates that there are no “strong” or “very
strong” correlations among the Dimensions, and only two “moderate” correlations
are present: a positive correlation between “Research” and “Knowledge Transfer,”
and a negative correlation between “Research” and “Regional Engagement.” This
outcome is favorable for the ranking, as it suggests that
the five Dimensions under study are largely independent. To illustrate
these “moderate” correlations, Figure 6 presents the distribution of scores
for both cases: panel (a) displays the data for “Research”
and “Knowledge Transfer” (correlation coefficient = 0.5509), while panel (b)
shows the data for “Research” and “Regional Engagement” (correlation coefficient
= -0.4175). These plots are representative of moderate positive and
negative correlations, respectively.
