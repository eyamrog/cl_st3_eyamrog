Methods: In May 2021, a private indoor event attended by
high school adolescents resulted in a superspreading incident. An anonymous
questionnaire was distributed to all individuals invited to the event
to collect information on symptoms, prior COVID-19 infection, vaccination status,
and behaviors during the event. Participants were categorized into two
groups: vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. A sample from a fully
vaccinated symptomatic participant was subjected to genomic sequencing. General characteristics
of the study groups were summarized using both categorical and
continuous variables. The incidence of COVID-19 in each group was
calculated as the number of COVID-19 positive cases divided by
the total number of individuals in the group, multiplied by
100.
