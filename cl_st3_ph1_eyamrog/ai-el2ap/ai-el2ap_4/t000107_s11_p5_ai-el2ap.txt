One justification for the use of bibliometrics is its capacity
to analyze extended periods of scholarly production and to identify,
disseminate, and highlight significant information across various fields of study
(Ribeiro, 2017). These features also enable the (re)structuring of academic
domains, regardless of their prominence. In translation studies, for instance,
research mapping assists in organizing specialized literature by providing an
overview of existing research on the translation of scientific articles
in the medical field. Additionally, mapping is valuable for research
funding agencies, as it supplies data that indicate both the
most and least frequently studied topics. Bibliometric research also contributes
by categorizing academic output according to researchers, regions, and higher
education institutions, which, in this context, can facilitate the identification
of researchers with an interest in the translation of medical
texts.
