Following the event, positive and negative COVID-19 cases among participants
were identified using various commercially available test kits (PCR or
rapid antigen) at private laboratories. Due to the lower sensitivity
of rapid antigen tests compared to PCR, individuals who only
underwent rapid antigen testing were classified as COVID-19 positive if
they reported more than three symptoms, including anosmia, even in
cases where the rapid antigen test result was negative and
no PCR test was conducted (Pilarowski et al., 2021). Symptom
data for each group were summarized as categorical variables using
frequencies and percentages, and comparisons between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups
were performed using the chi-square (𝝌2) test.
