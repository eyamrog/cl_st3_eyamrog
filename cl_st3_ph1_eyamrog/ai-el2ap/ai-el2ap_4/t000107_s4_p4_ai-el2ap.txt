Overall, the mapping presented in this study has two primary
practical applications: (1) assisting students and researchers interested in medical
translation in selecting appropriate research centers and areas of focus,
and (2) informing policy decisions regarding the allocation of resources
for the development of translation studies in Brazil. Although the
limitations of the websites utilized and the complexity of the
search strategies may have resulted in the omission of some
theses and dissertations completed in Brazil during the study period,
this work aims to stimulate further comprehensive research in the
field. Medical translation is an area in which many translators
also serve as authors; for example, numerous Brazilian physicians write
their articles in English or self-translate their manuscripts. Consequently, qualitative
analysis grounded in translation studies theories is both relevant and
necessary, as expertise in the field and in the specific
domain can enhance the organization of research activities and the
effective use of available resources.
