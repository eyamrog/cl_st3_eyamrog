Table 9 presents a summary of the means and standard
deviations of the Indicator magnitudes for each Dimension. The results
indicate a satisfactory level of independence among the Indicators, as
evidenced by a maximum average correlation coefficient of 0.3515 observed
in the "Research" Dimension, which represents the highest correlation identified.
These findings support the conclusion that the Dimensions and Indicators
selected by "U-Multirank" constitute an appropriate set for evaluating academic
institutions, with minimal redundancy in the measurements.
