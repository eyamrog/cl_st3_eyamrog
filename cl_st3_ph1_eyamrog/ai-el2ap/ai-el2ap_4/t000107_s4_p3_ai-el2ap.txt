Another notable finding, which emerged incidentally from our searches on
the Domínio Público, BDTD, and CAPES websites, is that the
translation, validation, and cultural adaptation of medical questionnaires constitute a
prevalent area of research. However, these studies are predominantly conducted
by scholars in the health sciences rather than by researchers
in translation studies. This observation highlights the existing interdisciplinarity between
applied linguistics and health sciences, which could be further enhanced
through greater involvement from the field of translation studies. Accordingly,
we collected quantitative data related to this issue and intend
to conduct future research on the role of translators within
teams responsible for the development and translation of medical questionnaires.
