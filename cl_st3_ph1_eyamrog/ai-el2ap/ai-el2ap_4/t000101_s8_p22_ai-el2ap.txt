Within this framework, this paper addresses the following specific questions:
How does the bureaucracy respond to an administration characterized by
illiberal populism? Do these responses, in turn, influence processes of
policy dismantling? How does the bureaucracy contribute to distinguishing between
ordinary policy change and policy dismantling? The bureaucracy may, in
some cases, openly resist or act to limit the extent
of policy dismantling, as demonstrated by Guedes-Neto and Peters (2021)
in their experimental study. Alternatively, bureaucrats may, due to fear,
withdraw from positions and institutions where dismantling is occurring, thereby
indirectly facilitating further policy dismantling by default. In this latter
scenario, the state is left with both dismantled policies and
diminished state capacity. Brazil’s federal administration is characterized by a
professionalized civil service. Certain institutions, such as the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, have a structured and well-established bureaucracy, with personnel
selected through open public examinations since the 1940s. Since the
1988 Constitution, public entrance exams have been mandatory for the
selection of all tenure-track federal employees. Subsequently, several new and
specialized career tracks have been created, including Specialist in Public
Policy and Management (EPPGG), Planning and Budget Analyst (APO), Foreign
Trade Specialist (ACE), Infrastructure Analyst, and Technical Social Policy Analyst
(ATPS), among others. Data from IPEA (2021) indicate significant growth
in the number of federal positions in the executive branch,
increasing from approximately 5 million in 1986 to just over
10 million in 2018. Although the number of civil service
positions suggests a large state apparatus, the cost of the
civil service at all levels (federal, state, and municipal) and
across all branches (executive, legislative, and judiciary) increased by only
1 percentage point from 2004 to 2017, rising from 9.6%
to 10.5% of the country’s GDP.
