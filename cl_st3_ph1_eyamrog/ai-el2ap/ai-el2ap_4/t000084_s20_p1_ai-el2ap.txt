Appendix A. The most frequently used emojis across cognitive, teaching,
and social presences were the Clapping Hands emoji (n =
287), Winking Face emoji (n = 251), Thumbs-Up emoji (n

Smiling Face emoji (n = 112), Smiling Face With Smiling
Eyes and Hearts emoji (n = 111), and Rolling On
The Floor Laughing emoji (n = 41). Frequencies for each
