In AbCSim, the transmission probability resulting from interpersonal contact is
determined not only by epidemiological parameters but also by the
variable v, which modulates the basic transmission rate (𝛽). The
variable v changes throughout the year and is inversely proportional
to the daily mean temperature, reflecting findings from studies that
characterize COVID-19 as a seasonal disease [36][37][38]. Consequently, the value
of 𝛽 is adjusted by v(Temp), which attains its maximum
value of 1.0 on July 15 and its minimum value
of 0.5 on January 15, corresponding to periods of lower
and higher daily mean temperatures, respectively, in the southern hemisphere.
