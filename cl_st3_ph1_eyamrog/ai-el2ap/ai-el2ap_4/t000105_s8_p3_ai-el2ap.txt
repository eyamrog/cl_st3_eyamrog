Additional challenges specific to the disease include the increased likelihood
that only individuals with severe symptoms seek medical attention and
undergo diagnostic testing, the high proportion of infected individuals who
experience mild symptoms or remain asymptomatic, and the influence of
social determinants on disease outcomes [5-7]. These factors can affect
transmission dynamics, contribute to underreporting, and obscure the accuracy of
COVID-19 data.
