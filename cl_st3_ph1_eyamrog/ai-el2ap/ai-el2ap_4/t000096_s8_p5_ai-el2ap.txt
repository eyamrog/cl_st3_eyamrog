Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the significance of utilizing
educational platforms to address the challenges associated with remote education
(Crick et al., 2020). Mandatory confinement measures rendered in-person instruction
unfeasible, as was the case in Ecuador, where remote education
was implemented across all educational levels. This situation underscored the
essential role of online learning in facilitating knowledge development in
the 21st century (Meier, 2021).
