Data collection was conducted using offline devices. At the end
of each day, in a location with a stable internet
connection, the devices were synchronized and the collected data were
uploaded to the cloud storage associated with the DataGoalÂ® software.
The devices were subsequently recharged in preparation for use on
the following day of data collection.
