Aslanargun et al. (2012) examined the effects of pre-operative oral
administration of Passiflora incarnata Linnaeus on anxiety, psychomotor function, sedation,
and hemodynamic parameters in patients undergoing spinal anesthesia. Their findings
indicate that pre-operative oral administration of Passiflora incarnata Linnaeus effectively
reduces pre-anesthetic anxiety without significantly affecting psychomotor performance, sedation levels,
or hemodynamic stability, suggesting that it is a safe and
effective anxiolytic agent in this clinical context.
