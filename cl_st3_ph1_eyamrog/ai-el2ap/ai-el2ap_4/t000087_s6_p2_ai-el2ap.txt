In the anonymous questionnaire, 47 attendees (28.6%) reported a previous
COVID-19 infection within the past year and had fully recovered
prior to the event; of these, 28 were unvaccinated and
19 had received at least one vaccine dose. None of
these previously infected individuals experienced reinfection or developed symptoms following
the event. This finding aligns with previous research indicating a
lower risk of reinfection among individuals under 65 years of
age (Hansen et al., 2021), as well as preliminary evidence
suggesting that natural immunity provides greater protection against infection with
the Delta variant of concern (VOC) compared to vaccine-induced immunity
(Gazit et al., 2021). Although it cannot be conclusively determined
that the superspreading event was caused by the Delta variant,
as only one sample from a symptomatic, fully vaccinated individual
was sequenced, the data indicate a higher risk of infection
among na√Øve or vaccinated adolescents compared to those with prior
natural infection.
