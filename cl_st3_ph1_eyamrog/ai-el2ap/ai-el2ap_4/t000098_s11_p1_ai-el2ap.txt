More than a year after the onset of the Covid-19
pandemic, statistical monitoring continues to present significant challenges. Although diagnostic
tests for detecting infection are now considerably more accessible than
during the initial stages of the pandemic, disparities in access
persist across different localities and social groups [O’Driscoll et al.,
2021: 140]. Furthermore, the effects of earlier testing limitations continue
to influence cumulative case indicators. The use of additional epidemiologically
relevant variables, such as hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and intubations, is
constrained by inconsistent definitions of these events and, more importantly,
by the lack of systematic reporting in most official information
systems. Consequently, the number of deaths is widely regarded as
a more reliable indicator of the magnitude of the epidemic
[O’Driscoll et al., 2021: 140] and for understanding its dynamics
[Hallal, 2020: 2403]. Heuveline and Tzen (2021: 6) also argue
that mortality data are more comparable and generally more reliable,
although they are not entirely free from underestimation [Orellana et
al., 2020], making them particularly relevant for evaluating public policy
responses to the pandemic. Nevertheless, this focus does not preclude
recognition of the substantial human impact associated with non-fatal cases
of the disease.
