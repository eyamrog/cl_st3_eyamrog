By mapping the landscape of randomized clinical trial protocols that
incorporate physical activity for women with breast cancer, this scoping
review provides new insights into potential interventions for healthcare professionals.
Additionally, the review aims to support improvements in the physical
and mental health of women with breast cancer through complementary
therapies. Specifically, this scoping review sought to identify and characterize
study protocols involving physical activity and/or physical exercise as interventions
during breast cancer treatment. The review highlights the types, frequency,
duration, intensity, and timing of these therapeutic interventions, as well
as the outcomes reported in the included studies.
