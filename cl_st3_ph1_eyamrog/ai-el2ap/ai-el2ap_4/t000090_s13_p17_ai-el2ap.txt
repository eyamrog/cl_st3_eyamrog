The data exhibit a cloud of dispersed points with a
tendency toward positive correlation, indicating that the scores for individual
Dimensions are generally higher in institutions with higher average scores
across all Dimensions. While this outcome is expected, Figure 4
provides a more detailed illustration of these patterns. The presence
of vertical lines in the figure represents the range of
scores for each Dimension at a given average score. These
ranges are substantial, typically spanning approximately 2 units, which constitutes
half of the total possible range, as the averages vary
from 0 to 4.0.
