This paper presents an agent-based model designed to predict the
daily evolution of the number of individuals hospitalized in intensive
care due to COVID-19, with results provided for the year
2020. The model also accounts for the number of deaths,
reported cases, asymptomatic individuals, and other relevant epidemiological variables, disaggregated
by age group. Key characteristics of the climate in Paraná
city (Entre Ríos, Argentina), as well as its social dynamics
and public transportation systems, are incorporated as input parameters, alongside
the various phases of isolation and social distancing implemented during
the study period. The model employs a set of Hidden
Markov Models to simulate virus transmission associated with population mobility
and activities within the city. Disease progression within hosts is
represented by modeling the stages of infection, considering the presence
of comorbidities and the proportion of asymptomatic cases. By calibrating
the model to observed data on intensive care unit hospitalizations
and COVID-19-related deaths in the study area, the system enables
analysis of the effects of isolation and social distancing measures
on population dynamics. Furthermore, the model facilitates the simulation of
scenarios that could lead to healthcare system overload due to
insufficient infrastructure, as well as the assessment of the potential
impact of social events or increased population mobility.
