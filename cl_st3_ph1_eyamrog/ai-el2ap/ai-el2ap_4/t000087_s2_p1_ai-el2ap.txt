We thank Sandra López-León, MD, PhD, for her guidance as
an epidemiologist and physician, as well as for her support
in data analysis and interpretation. Bioethicist German Carreto Chavez reviewed
and approved the questionnaire and the overall project, determining that
there was no risk to participants, that participant anonymization was
ensured, and that international bioethical guidelines were followed; informed consent
was obtained from all participants and/or their parents when required.
We also thank Ariela Landsmanas Goldberg for providing essential information
and assisting with the distribution of the questionnaire. We acknowledge
Ricardo Grande and Karel Estrada for their contributions to sequencing
and bioinformatics technical support, respectively, as members of the Unidad
Universitaria de Secuenciación Masiva y Bioinformática (UNAM) and the Laboratorio
Nacional de Apoyo Tecnológico a las Ciencias Genómicas (CONACyT).
