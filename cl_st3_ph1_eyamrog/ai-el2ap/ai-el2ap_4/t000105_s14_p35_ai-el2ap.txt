When the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the sample was
zero or below the established cut-off value, no visible colored
band appeared in the test region of the device, indicating
a negative result. A colored line consistently appeared in the
control region, serving as a procedural control to confirm that
the test was functioning properly. The results were read after
a minimum waiting period of 15 minutes and within a
maximum of 20 minutes.
