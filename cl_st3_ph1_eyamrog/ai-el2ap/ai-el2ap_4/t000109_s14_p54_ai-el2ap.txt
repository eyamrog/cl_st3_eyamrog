Based on values reported in the literature [31], an initial
calibration of parameters primarily associated with virus transmission among hosts
was performed. To refine these parameter values, data on the
progression of epidemic indicators in the municipality of Vo, a
small village in northern Italy, from March to May 2020
[46], were utilized. Additionally, information regarding the geographical, climatic, demographic,
and behavioral characteristics of the local population was incorporated.
