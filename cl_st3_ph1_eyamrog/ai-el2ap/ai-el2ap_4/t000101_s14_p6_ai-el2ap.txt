Interviews were analyzed using NVivo software, which facilitated the coding
of data and the execution of text queries. The terms
employed in the coding and text query processes were not
derived from specific interview questions but rather emerged from themes
spontaneously introduced by respondents. The coding process subsequently generated additional
codes related to career decisions and intervieweesâ€™ perceptions, consistent with
a grounded theory approach (Charmaz, 2006). Although not all interviews
have been fully transcribed, interviewer notes were utilized for analysis
in cases where complete transcriptions were unavailable. All direct quotations
presented in this paper are drawn from the 41 transcribed
interviews and have been translated from Portuguese to English by
the author.
