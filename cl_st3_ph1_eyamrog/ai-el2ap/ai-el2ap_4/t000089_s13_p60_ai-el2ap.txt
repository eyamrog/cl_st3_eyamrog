The Hampshire Agreed Syllabus demonstrates significant potential for fostering intercultural
learning. Through its approach of "Religious Education as a process
of conceptual enquiry," the syllabus seeks to examine children's understanding
of religious values, meanings, and propositional claims, while encouraging critical
engagement within a framework of empathetic dialogue. Teachers are expected
to facilitate discussions in which pupils articulate their perspectives on
both familiar concepts—such as community, ritual, and law—and more specific
religious concepts, including Umma, Eucharist, and Torah. During the contextualisation
phase, students are introduced to stories, case studies, and testimonies
that broaden their awareness of alternative frameworks of meaning. In
the evaluative stage, teachers prompt pupils to consider how these
concepts and practices might inform or challenge their own perspectives.
This process supports the development of students' vocabularies by associating
meanings and modes of use with particular worldviews.
