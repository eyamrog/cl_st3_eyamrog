The margins in the text serve to establish the setting,
clearly positioning the characters either within a specific room of
the home or outside it. In this context, the margins
function as defined spatial boundaries, referred to here as ambient
margins. Various instances illustrate how characters are framed by different
elements within the domestic or natural environment, including the sofa
(pages 7 and 19), the carpet (pages 7 and 19),
the table (page 8), the house and the car (page
11), a window and two shelves (page 12), a table
and a piece of furniture (page 15), a fence (pages
16 and 17), the stream and trees (page 20), a
bench and trees (page 21), a path and trees (page
23), a fence and trees (page 24), a bed (page
27), and a door and a closet (page 28). Similarly,
the written text is framed by various elements, such as
the walk, pens, shelving, pictures, and paper (page 6), the
wall (page 9), the countryside and the house (page 10),
pots and kitchen jars (page 13), a lamp and an
armchair (page 14), a tree, a fence, Daddy, and Max
(page 17), a dress-up box, a pair of glasses and
a wig, some pictures, and a bookshelf (page 18), the
grass, a bench, and a stream (page 21), the countryside
(page 22), a tree, the grass, and a paper bin
(page 25), a table, a lamp, some papers, and pencils
(page 26), and a blackboard, a teddy bear, a doll,
and some papers and pencils (page 29). These framing devices
function to delineate boundaries that either separate or enclose specific
elements, as noted by Painter et al. (2013, p. 92).
