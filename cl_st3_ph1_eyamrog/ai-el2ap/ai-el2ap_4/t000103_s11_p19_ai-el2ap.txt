Previous studies have examined the effects of clause order and
anaphor salience on ambiguity resolution, as well as the influence
of first language (L1) on anaphora resolution in a second
language (L2). For example, Sorace and Filiaci (2006) investigated ambiguous
anaphora resolution in Italian; Alonso-Ovalle et al. (2002) and Keating
et al. (2011) in Spanish; Valenzuela et al. (2011) in
both Spanish and English; and Lobo and Silva (2016) in
Portuguese. However, few studies have compared anaphora resolution across multiple
languages, and Portuguese is typically underrepresented in such research. Additionally,
previous studies often do not specify semantic criteria for verb
selection in their experimental tasks. In contrast, the present study
explicitly defines these criteria and examines how different combinations of
verbs influence anaphora resolution.
