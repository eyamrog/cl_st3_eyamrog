Contemporary students, often referred to as digital natives, require alternative
approaches to learning, making the integration of information and communication
technologies (ICT) into teaching strategies a potential means to enhance
the flexibility and accessibility of education. According to Llorente, Cabero,
and Barroso (2015), such alternatives include social and collaborative learning,
decontextualized learning approaches such as the flipped classroom, and ubiquitous,
mobile, and personalized learning (m-learning), which integrate real and virtual
environments, among other methods.
