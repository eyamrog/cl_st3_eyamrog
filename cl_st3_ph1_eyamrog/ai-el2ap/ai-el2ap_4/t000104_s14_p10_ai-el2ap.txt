Biomonitoring relies on data regarding the distribution of organisms within
each habitat to assess environmental conditions. In this study, sampled
organisms were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level using
identification keys. The method outlined by CETESB (2019) assigns scores
to each organism based on their sensitivity and tolerance to
pollutants: sensitive species receive a score of 5, indifferent species
4, tolerant species 3, second-order opportunists 2, and first-order opportunists
1 (Borja et al., 2000; Borja and Muxika, 2005). A
biological index is then calculated by summing these values to
indicate water quality, which is classified as very poor, poor,
fair, good, or excellent (Buss, 2008; CETESB, 2019). The calculation
of these indices enables qualitative comparisons between the sampling sites.
