The selected multimodal text conveys meaning through the deliberate choices
made by the writer and illustrator in selecting and integrating
visual elements with written language. This integration results in a
multimodal text shaped by the cultural conventions relevant to its
context, as all texts are produced within specific cultural frameworks
that influence their construction; for example, multimodal texts in Western
cultures differ from those in Eastern cultures. Therefore, analyzing each
semiotic resource (such as music, image, or language) in isolation
is not appropriate, as these elements function collectively to produce
meaning. Accordingly, the analysis focuses on the use of multiple
semiotic channels that together generate meaning within a particular cultural
context, as described by Gatti (2013, p. 17).
