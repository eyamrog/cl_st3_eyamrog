The appendix of this paper contains all sentences used in
the study in the three target languages. The following section
presents and discusses the results. Statistical analyses were conducted using
SPSS software (version 26). Due to the limited size of
the dataset, the findings cannot be generalized. Nevertheless, the study
provides evidence relevant to testing the syntactic and semantic hypotheses
in the languages examined.
