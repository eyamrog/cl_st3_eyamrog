This study investigated the morphological and respiratory differences during in
vitro shoot formation from seeds and nodal segments (NS) of
Acanthostachys strobilacea (Schult. & Schult.f.) Klotzsch, in order to elucidate
the basis for observed differences in plants obtained by micropropagation.
Over a 35-day culture period, plants derived from seeds developed
14 days earlier than those from NS, and exhibited longer
leaves and a greater number of roots. In contrast, NS-derived
plantlets demonstrated shoot multiplication. Measurements of O2 consumption and CO2
release revealed peaks at 7 days for NS and at
14 days for seeds, indicating a high energetic requirement during
the initial growth phase. The respiration peak was higher in
NS than in seeds, which may be attributable to the
increased energy demand associated with multiple bud breaks in NS.
Following these peaks, respiration rates declined and converged between the
two propagule types by day 35, which may reflect an
increase in photosynthetic activity associated with shoot development. These findings
indicate that the developmental processes in NS-derived plants influence energy
and respiratory demands differently compared to those in seed-derived seedlings.
