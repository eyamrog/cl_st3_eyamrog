On data collection days, the entire field team assembled at
a designated support location, where they donned personal protective equipment,
received general instructions, and were informed about the specific census
sectors to be visited that day. The teams then proceeded
to the assigned census sectors, where each interviewer approached a
household and, under the supervision of the researchers, selected an
adult participant for the interview. If a household was closed,
the selected resident was absent, or there was a refusal
to participate, the team approached the neighboring household to the
right; if this was also unsuccessful, they then approached the
household to the left of the originally selected residence. If
refusal or absence persisted, or if there were no residents
present, the team proceeded to the next pre-selected household. No
attempts were made to revisit closed households.
