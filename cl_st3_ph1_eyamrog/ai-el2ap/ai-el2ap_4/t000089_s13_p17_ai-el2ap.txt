Dewey’s and Rorty’s positions can be elucidated through Thomas Kuhn’s
concept of scientific paradigms. In The Structure of Scientific Revolutions
(1962), Kuhn argues that the constitutive nature of language shapes
epistemic paradigms, leading to the development of distinct worldviews throughout
history, each associated with specific linguistic preconceptions. For example, the
transition from the Ptolemaic to the Copernican paradigm in Western
science enabled the advancement of new research methodologies and facilitated
the observation of celestial movements previously regarded as impossible, due
to the prevailing belief in the immutability of the superlunary
heavens. In contrast, Kuhn notes that Chinese cosmological frameworks, which
did not exclude the possibility of celestial motion, allowed for
earlier documentation of phenomena such as the appearance of new
stars (Kuhn, 1962, p. 116). As Kuhn (1962, p. 113)
states, “What a man sees depends both upon what he
looks at and also upon what his previous visual-conceptual experience
has taught him to see.”
