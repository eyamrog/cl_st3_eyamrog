For the Location submodel, a dedicated geographic information system (GIS)
module within the Repast platform is utilized, as detailed in
Section 4.2. This system enables the differentiation and characterization of
various types of locations, including family residences, buildings, stores, squares,
transportation facilities, and other relevant sites where individuals may be
present. The geographical environment and each subdivided plot of the
city are modeled as agents, each possessing distinct methods and
attributes. Additionally, major public transportation facilities are represented as specific
locations where people congregate, as described in the Transportation submodel
(Section 4.2.1). The level of detail and accuracy of the
geographical information provided by this system are essential for the
precise representation of mobility patterns and activities of each Ha
within the simulated society.
