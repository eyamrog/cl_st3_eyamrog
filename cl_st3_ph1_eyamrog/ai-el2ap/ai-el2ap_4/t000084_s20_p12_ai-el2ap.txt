The following example illustrates that course participants frequently assumed the
role of teacher during the course. In a post from
Group 3, Participant B replicated the use of the Mobile
Phone emoji, which had previously been employed by instructors to
recommend applications and articles relevant to the task. Additionally, Participant
B incorporated the Up Pointing Index emoji and the Smiling
Face emoji in their posts to motivate a peer to
further develop the task.
