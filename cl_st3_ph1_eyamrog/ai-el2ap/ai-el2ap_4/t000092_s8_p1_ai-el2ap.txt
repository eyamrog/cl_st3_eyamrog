At the end of 2019, a previously unidentified coronavirus was
detected in Wuhan, China, exhibiting atypical characteristics and subsequently spreading
globally. Owing to its predominant pulmonary involvement in severe cases
and its genetic and clinical similarities to the virus responsible
for the 2003 pandemic, it was designated as severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the associated disease was
named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
