In addition to the underfunding of the Unified Health System
(SUS), the COVID-19 pandemic led to increased healthcare service costs.
Among the Brazilian regions, the South had the highest mean
total expenditure associated with the average length of hospital stay
for COVID-19 treatment. In contrast, the mean cost in Rio
de Janeiro was approximately half that of the South region,
despite Rio de Janeiro exhibiting a higher COVID-19 lethality rate.
