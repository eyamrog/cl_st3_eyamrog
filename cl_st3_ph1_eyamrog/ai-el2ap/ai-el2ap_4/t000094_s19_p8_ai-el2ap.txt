After several pages in which the narrative occurs outside the
home, the setting returns to the domestic environment on page
26. The text explicitly identifies the location as Emily’s bedroom,
as indicated by the phrase “I lay by books upon
my bed,” which appears centered on the left side of
the page and is written on the wall. Visual elements
further confirm this setting, as a portion of the bed
and part of Dad’s legs are visible. On the subsequent
page, Emily is depicted in bed with both of her
fathers. In this illustration, Daddy is positioned on the right,
which is typically associated with prominence. This arrangement corresponds with
the accompanying text, which specifies that Daddy is the one
reading: “My Daddy reads in silly voices, and then I
laugh with all my might, until it’s time to say
‘goodnight.’” All three characters are shown looking at the book,
which is being held by both Emily and Dad.
