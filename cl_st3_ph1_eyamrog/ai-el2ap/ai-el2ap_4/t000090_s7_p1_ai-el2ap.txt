Academic evaluation has been a longstanding subject of consideration in
the field of education. In Brazil, higher education has been
subject to evaluation for an extended period (Guimarães and Esteves,
2018). Specifically, graduate programs have been evaluated for several decades
by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior
(CAPES) (Rodrigues et al., 2020). Currently, significant changes are being
implemented in the evaluation criteria, with an increased emphasis on
multidimensional approaches.
