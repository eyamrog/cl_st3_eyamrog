To determine the position of each Ha at each time
step, AbCSim generates a sequence of waypoints at specific geographical
locations based on a set of Hidden Markov Models (HMM)
[25]. Each HMM specifies the probabilities of transitioning from one
position to another, contingent on the position occupied by Ha
in the previous time step and the activities associated with
the specific attributes of the Ha.
