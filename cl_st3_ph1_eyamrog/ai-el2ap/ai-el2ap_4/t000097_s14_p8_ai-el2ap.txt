Breast cancer is defined by the uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal
breast cells and represents the most frequently diagnosed cancer among
women worldwide. The earliest scientific publications on breast cancer date
back to the 1880s, including studies by Snow (1884) and
Cheyne (1889). In recent decades, there has been a substantial
increase in research activity on this topic, with over 500,000
articles currently indexed in major scientific databases. Since the 1960s,
the number of clinical trials and related studies has grown
significantly, focusing on early diagnosis and the development of various
treatment modalities aimed at improving patient outcomes and quality of
life.
