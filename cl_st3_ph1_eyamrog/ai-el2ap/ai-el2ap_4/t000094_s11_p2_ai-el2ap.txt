Multimodal texts, such as the picturebook analyzed in this article,
employ various modes, each characterized by distinct sets of semiotic
resources that contribute specific functions to the overall meaning-making process.
The concept of mode has been defined and developed in
several studies, including those by Elleström (2010) and Bateman (2011).
Mode is generally understood as a “socially shaped and culturally
given resource for meaning making” (Kress, 2010, p. 54), indicating
that the selection and use of modes in any communicative
context are influenced by both cultural and contextual factors.
