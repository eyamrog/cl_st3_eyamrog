Second-order opportunistic organisms include the family Ceratopogonidae, within the order
Diptera, as well as members of the order Odonata. Previous
studies have demonstrated that both the density and richness of
Ceratopogonidae larvae are higher in forested environments compared to areas
with greater levels of deforestation, as increased exposure in deforested
areas inhibits egg deposition (Yanoviak 1999a, 2001; Ngai et al.
2008). Therefore, the presence of these organisms in the samples
collected from the Cachoeira do Para√≠so waterfall and its surrounding
areas can be attributed to the relatively high level of
environmental preservation in this region.
