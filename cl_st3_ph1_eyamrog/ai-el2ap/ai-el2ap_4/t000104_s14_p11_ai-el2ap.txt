Ecological indices, including species richness, evenness, and Shannon-Wiener diversity, were
calculated using PrimerÂ® 6.0 software to evaluate the responses of
the macroinvertebrate community to environmental variations (Borja et al., 2000;
Borja and Muxika, 2005). These indices were statistically compared using
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Additionally, community structure was assessed through
cluster analysis of the samples and descriptors, employing Simpson's index
and paired group comparisons.
