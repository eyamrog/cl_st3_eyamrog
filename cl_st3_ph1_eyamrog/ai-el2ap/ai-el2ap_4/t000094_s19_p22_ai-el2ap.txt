All actions in the story occur either inside or outside
the house, with indoor scenes depicted on pages 7, 8,
9, 14, 15, and 26 to 29, and outdoor scenes
taking place immediately outside the house (pages 10 and 11),
in the park (pages 16 and 17), in the stream
(pages 20 and 21), and in the countryside (pages 22
to 25). The recurring appearance of the kettle on pages
9 and 12 serves as an indicator that the setting
is the home. Furthermore, the sitting room is the primary
location for most indoor activities, as shown on pages 6,
7, 14, 15, 18, and 19.
