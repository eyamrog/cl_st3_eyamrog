The relative frequencies of the sociodemographic variables were calculated for
each survey stage (1, 2, and 3) and for both
cities combined. The prevalence of seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2, along with
corresponding 95% confidence intervals, was estimated for each survey stage,
for each city individually, and for both cities together. Pearson's
Chi-square test was applied to compare the proportions of sociodemographic
variables and the prevalence of seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 across the
different survey stages. Weighting factors were incorporated into the analyses
using the svy command in Stata® software, version 12.0. Statistical
significance was defined as P≤0.05.
