ETB National Community Schools deliver Religious Education (RE) in accordance
with a model that aligns with the principles of multidenominational
education. This approach emphasizes the incorporation of pupils’ individual religious
backgrounds by encouraging engagement with their parents and religious communities
in activities designed to explore conceptual meanings and spiritual experiences
collaboratively with teachers and peers. Consequently, the curriculum does not
approach spiritual questions in isolation but instead allows for a
degree of subsidiarity, respecting parental influence in religious matters. Additionally,
the Goodness Me, Goodness You! (GMGY) curriculum supports learning as
an open-ended process by avoiding a strictly defined set of
classroom topics and content. Instead, it promotes the active consideration
of pupils’ personal experiences, enabling both teachers and students to
critically reassess their understanding of various religious and non-religious worldviews.
