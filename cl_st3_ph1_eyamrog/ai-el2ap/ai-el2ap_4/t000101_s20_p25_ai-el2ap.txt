I worked in this sector until January 2019, when Secretariat
H was dissolved. At that time, the General Coordination where
I had been employed from 2006 to 2016, as well
as the entire Department, were also eliminated. Since then, the
Ministry of I has not implemented any policies related to
H. The entire department responsible for J policies was likewise
dissolved. Throughout 2019, these policies remained in an uncertain state;
although they formally continued to exist, there was no designated
sector responsible for their implementation (interview 47).
