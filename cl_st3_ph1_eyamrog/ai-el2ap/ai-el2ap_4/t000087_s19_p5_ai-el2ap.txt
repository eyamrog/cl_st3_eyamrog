A total of 70 individuals (42.7%) had received at least
one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, with 50 being fully
vaccinated and 20 partially vaccinated. Nineteen participants (27.1%) had contracted
and fully recovered from COVID-19 in the year preceding the
event, and none of these individuals experienced reinfection as a
result of attending. The majority of participants (92.9%) reported not
using a face mask during the event. Following the event,
8 out of 70 vaccinated adolescents (11.4%) tested positive for
COVID-19; among these, 7 (14%) were fully vaccinated and 1
(5%) was partially vaccinated. Only one fully vaccinated individual remained
asymptomatic. The most frequently reported symptoms included runny nose, anosmia,
fatigue, general discomfort, cough, ageusia, and low-grade fever.
