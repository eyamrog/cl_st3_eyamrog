The original framework was developed to address a specific question:
why would rational, utility-maximizing politicians, whose primary objective is typically
re-election, intentionally engage in potentially unpopular actions such as policy
dismantling (Bauer et al., 2012, p. 31)? While this question
is pertinent in the context of policy dismantling under fiscal
constraints, it may not be applicable to recent instances of
policy dismantling associated with illiberal populism. In these cases, politicians
often justify dismantling by invoking narratives such as the existence
of a “deep state” (Abramson, 2017) or by alleging partisanship
among civil servants. Illiberal populists may thus pursue policy dismantling
as a deliberate strategy to appeal to their electoral base,
rather than as a contradiction to their re-election goals.
