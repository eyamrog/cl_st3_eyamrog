International rankings for academic evaluation emerged in the 2000s (Calderón
and França, 2018) with the objective of identifying academic institutions
that could be classified as "world-class institutions." The first international
academic ranking was the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU),
also known as the "Shanghai Ranking," which was established in
2003 by Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China (Calderón and
França, 2018; http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2020.html). The primary purpose of this ranking was
to provide the Chinese government with information to facilitate the
selection of international educational institutions for Chinese students studying abroad
and to assess the standing of Chinese institutions relative to
international standards.
