The tables demonstrate substantial variation in Covid-19 mortality rates according
to age. Table 1 presents data from a group of
countries that accounted for 49% of global Covid-19 deaths as
of January 28, 2021. The data indicate that, with the
exception of the transition from the 0–9 to the 10–19
age group, mortality rates increase consistently and markedly with each
successive age group. This trend is pronounced, as the mortality
rate among individuals aged 80 years or older is more
than 30 times higher than that among individuals aged 40–49
years, and similarly, the rate for the 40–49 age group
is more than 30 times higher than that for individuals
aged 0–19 years. The difference in mortality rates between individuals
aged 60 years and older and those under 60 is
also substantial, with the rate for the older group being
approximately 29 times higher.
