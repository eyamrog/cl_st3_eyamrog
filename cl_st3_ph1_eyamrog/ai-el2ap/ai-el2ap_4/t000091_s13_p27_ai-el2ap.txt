Grundmann et al. (2008) conducted a study to evaluate the
anxiolytic properties of a commercially available, phytochemically characterized extract of
Passiflora incarnata using the elevated plus maze test in mice.
Following oral administration, the extract produced an anxiolytic effect at
a dose of 375 mg/kg, which was comparable to the
effect observed with diazepam at 1.5 mg/kg, and displayed a
U-shaped dose-response curve. Antagonist studies were also performed using flumazenil,
a GABA/benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, and WAY-100635, a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist.
The anxiolytic effect of the extract was antagonized by flumazenil
but not by WAY-100635. This study provided the first in
vivo evidence that the anxiolytic activity of a Passiflora incarnata
extract is mediated via the GABAergic system.
