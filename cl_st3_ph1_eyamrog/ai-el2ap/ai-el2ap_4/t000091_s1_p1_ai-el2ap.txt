Anxiety among dental patients presents challenges for both practitioners and
patients, prompting ongoing research into effective management strategies to enhance
patient cooperation during dental procedures. This study aims to review
the literature regarding the use of herbal medicines for the
control of dental anxiety. A comprehensive bibliographic search was conducted
using the databases ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scielo, PubMed, and
The Cochrane Library, resulting in the inclusion of 57 articles.
The evidence indicates that Valeriana officinalis and Passiflora incarnata are
the most extensively studied herbal medicines for anxiety control and
are associated with relatively few adverse effects. Studies suggest that
these agents demonstrate relative safety, efficacy, lower cost, and reduced
concentrations of active ingredients with favorable outcomes and fewer side
effects compared to benzodiazepines. Nevertheless, further research is necessary to
clarify their actual effectiveness, optimal dosage, and potential side effects
when used for conscious sedation in dentistry.
