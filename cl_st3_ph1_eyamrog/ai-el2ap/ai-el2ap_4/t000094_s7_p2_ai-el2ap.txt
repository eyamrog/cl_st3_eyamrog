The multimodal nature of picturebooks supports the development of children's
multiliteracies by enabling them to engage with the interplay between
language and image in narrative construction (Unsworth, 2006). Consequently, picturebooks
can serve as effective tools for enhancing children's reading and
writing competencies (Soto Reatiga, 2017). As noted by Salisbury and
Styles (2012, p. 75), picturebooks function both as art objects
and as foundational literature for early childhood, providing readers with
engaging experiences through the integration of visual and verbal narratives.
Furthermore, picturebooks facilitate children's ability to make connections between the
fictional world depicted in the story and their own real-world
experiences.
