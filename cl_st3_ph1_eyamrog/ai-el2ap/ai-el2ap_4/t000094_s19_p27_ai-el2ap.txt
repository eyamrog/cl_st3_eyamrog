Regarding framing, the visuals in this book are considered bound,
as each image is enclosed by a margin or space
that separates the reader from the narrative world. This aligns
with Painter et al. (2013, p. 105), who state that
"Bound images, those set within a page margin or border,
demarcate the story world as more distinctly separated from the
readerâ€™s world than unbound ones and may also serve to
contain or confine the character." Additionally, the written text consistently
appears in black, providing a clear contrast against the lighter
backgrounds such as walls, pavement, or green grass on which
it is placed.
