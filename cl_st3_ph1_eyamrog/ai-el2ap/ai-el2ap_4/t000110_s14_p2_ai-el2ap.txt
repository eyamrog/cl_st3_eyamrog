During the dry season of 2014, sediment cores were collected
by divers from deep zones at both study sites. Site
selection was based on water depth profiles and riverbed sediment
sampling. A 122 cm core (XC1-02) was obtained from Arapujá
Island, and a 362 cm core (XC-03) was collected from
the Ria, using a 6 m long PVC tube, with
cores sectioned at 2 cm intervals. Core chronologies were established
using Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) and radiocarbon (14C) dating. Two
samples for quartz OSL dating were collected and processed at
the Luminescence and Gamma Spectrometry Laboratory, Instituto de Geociências, Universidade
de São Paulo. Four samples for 14C dating were prepared
and analyzed at the Analytic Radiocarbon Dating facility in Miami
and at the Radiocarbon Laboratory, Universidade Federal Fluminense (LAC-UFF). Further
methodological details are provided in Sawakuchi et al. (2015). Based
on OSL and 14C results, the base of the XC1-02
and XC-03 cores correspond to approximately 6,000 calibrated years before
present (cal yr BP) and 4,000 cal yr BP, respectively,
encompassing the end of the Mid-Holocene and the Late Holocene.
