The website www.dominiopublico.gov.br aims to facilitate broad access to literary,
artistic, and scientific works that are either in the public
domain or have been authorized for publication. The homepage includes
a basic search form that allows users to filter results
by media type (image, sound, text, and video), as well
as by category, author, title, and language. Additionally, the homepage
features a dedicated section for dissertations and theses, which was
utilized for the initial search in this study. In this
section, the filter "mestrado" (master) was selected under the "Nível"
(level) field, and the term "Tradução" (translation) was entered in
the "Palavras-Chave" (keywords) field (see Figure 1).
