This article examines the experiences of Ireland and England, which
represent distinct conceptions and practices of religious education (RE), to
develop a normative framework for organizing RE in multicultural states.
The analysis evaluates three conceptions of religious education: the liberal
conception, which prioritizes neutrality and objectivity; the pragmatist conception, characterized
by its egalitarian orientation; and the tradition-oriented conception, which is
grounded in substantive ethics. Rejecting the perspective that religious education
should be solely informative and devoid of critical engagement with
content, this article argues for an ethical-dialogical approach to RE.
In this model, pupils are encouraged to learn from one
anotherâ€™s beliefs and experiences, informed by their respective cultural traditions,
while maintaining the ability to critically assess diverse moral claims.
This approach is particularly suited to multidenominational schools that acknowledge
the ethical value of learning from religion and remain attentive
to issues of conscience in pluralistic settings.
