L. Kollmann & R. Goldenb., P.J.F. Guim., and Michelang. are
closely related based on plant architecture, exhibiting quadrangular branches, similar
leaf morphology and indumentum, thyrsoid inflorescences, 5-merous flowers, purple petals,
and stamens with glandular trichomes on their filaments. All three
species also occupy similar habitats, typically growing on rocky outcrops.
However, P. heteromallum can be distinguished from P. eglanduliferum by
the presence of glandular trichomes on the pedoconnective of the
antisepalous stamens and by having bracteoles that are slightly smaller
than the hypanthium. Additionally, P. tedescoi differs from P. eglanduliferum
in possessing hypanthia covered with glandular trichomes, isomorphic stamens within
the whorl, and bracteoles that are slightly smaller than the
hypanthia.
