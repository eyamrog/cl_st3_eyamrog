In April 2021, the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant was identified in
India and was classified as a variant of concern (VOC)
on May 11 due to its rapid transmission and potential
for immune evasion (Singh et al., 2021). The increased transmissibility
of the Delta variant led to a higher incidence of
breakthrough infections across various countries and populations (Baral et al.,
2021; Lopez Bernal et al., 2021). Among fully vaccinated healthcare
workers, the majority of breakthrough infections were reported to be
mild or asymptomatic (Linsenmeyer et al., 2021). However, there remains
limited information regarding the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 among vaccinated
and unvaccinated adolescents.
