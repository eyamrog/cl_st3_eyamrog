At times, the written text precedes the visual depiction of
the corresponding action, as observed on page 10, where the
text is positioned on the left, in the foreground, and
inscribed on the white pavement to ensure legibility: “I like
to help to wash the car, so that it sparkles
like a star. I squeeze the sponge to make some
bubbles, And splash around in all the puddles. And if
I’m feeling really cheeky, Super quiet and extra sneaky…I spray
my Daddy with the hose, until it runs between his
toes.” This textual element serves as an introduction to the
visual narrative presented on page 11. Conversely, the subsequent pages
exhibit the opposite pattern: on page 12, the visual action
of Emily cooking with her father appears first, with Emily
depicted on the right, while the corresponding written text, which
describes the cooking activity, is foregrounded at the bottom of
the page within the kitchen setting. On the following pages,
the written text again precedes the visual representation, with the
action of the three characters drinking tea depicted visually on
the subsequent page. Notably, there is an explicit reference to
the colour of Emily’s tea set—pink, a colour traditionally associated
with girls—both in the written text (“We sit around and
sip our drink, from my tea set which is pink,”
page 15) and in the visual representation. According to van
Leeuwen (2011), colour functions as a textual strategy to provide
cohesion to the narrative or to highlight specific aspects of
the characters. In this instance, the use of pink may
be considered stereotypical, as pink is widely recognised as a
colour associated with women and femininity, and is traditionally used
in the socialisation of girls.
