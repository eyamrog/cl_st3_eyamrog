Current protocols commonly involve home-based exercise interventions utilizing electronic devices,
such as activity-monitoring watches, internet-based software, and smartphone applications. These
approaches have been promoted for their potential to improve quality
of life, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic
and the widespread shift to remote work. Previous studies, including
that by Dong et al., have demonstrated that interventions combining
exercise with internet-based software can yield positive effects on muscle
strength and quality of life in patients during the postoperative
period following breast cancer treatment. Similarly, Galiano-Castillo et al. reported
that a physical exercise program delivered via internet software improved
and maintained quality of life, reduced pain and fatigue, and
enhanced muscle strength, thereby improving daily functional abilities in breast
cancer patients. The use of online tools and home-based interventions
may offer practical alternatives for both researchers and participants by
enabling broader recruitment and participation. The increased reliance on digital
tools during periods of recommended home confinement has highlighted the
potential of these methods for wider application. However, challenges such
as software limitations, lack of user proficiency, internet access issues,
and possible participant disengagement may restrict their effectiveness. Despite these
limitations, digital strategies can facilitate behavior change and enhance communication
and engagement between researchers and participants.
