In 2014, Ofsted published a report following inspections of certain
maintained faith schools, emphasizing the role of these institutions in
promoting their denominational ethos through specific routines such as prayers,
celebrations, and observance of religious holidays. For instance, Muslim schools
typically schedule five daily prayer times and may restrict physical
education during Ramadan. In one Hindu school, Sanskrit classes were
offered alongside the National Curriculum, and only vegetarian food was
provided (United Kingdom, Ofsted, 2014, sec. 68, 72). However, the
report also raised concerns that some Muslim schools might attempt
to integrate National Curriculum skills into a variety of contexts,
potentially affecting the delivery of required content. The report advised
inspectors to inquire about how the curriculum is organized to
ensure that all necessary skills and subjects mandated by the
National Curriculum are taught (United Kingdom, Ofsted, 2014, sec. 33).
Specifically, it noted that while art and music may be
restricted in some schools, these subjects are still required components
of the National Curriculum (United Kingdom, Ofsted, 2014, sec. 42).
