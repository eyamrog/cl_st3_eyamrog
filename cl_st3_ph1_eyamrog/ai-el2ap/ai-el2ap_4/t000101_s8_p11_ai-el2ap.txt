A change of a direct, indirect, hidden, or symbolic nature
that results in a reduction in the number of policies
within a specific area, a decrease in the number of
policy instruments employed, and/or a lowering of their intensity. Such
change may involve modifications to these fundamental components of policy
and/or may be accomplished by altering the capacities for their
implementation and oversight (Bauer et al., 2012, p. 35).
