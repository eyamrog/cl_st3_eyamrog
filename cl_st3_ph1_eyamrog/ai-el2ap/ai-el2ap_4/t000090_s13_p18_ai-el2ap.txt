These results demonstrate that the average values of the Dimensions
differ substantially across Academic Institutions, as their performance is not
consistent across all Dimensions, including among institutions within European countries.
This finding suggests that constructing an overall classification may not
be appropriate, as it would obscure the variability in performance
across different Dimensions, and there is no general justification for
prioritizing one Dimension over the others.
