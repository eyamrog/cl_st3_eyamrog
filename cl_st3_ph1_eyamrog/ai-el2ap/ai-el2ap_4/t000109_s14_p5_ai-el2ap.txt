Each Ha exhibits specific behaviors determined by its assigned age
range, habits, and residential neighborhood, which are randomly allocated at
the start of each simulation in accordance with the city's
population statistics. Based on these characteristics, each Ha moves independently
according to probabilities \(A \in \lambda_{h,e,l}(A, B, \pi)\), which are
derived from state change matrices (activities/locations) within the set \(\lambda_{h,e,l}\)
of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) that constitute the Mobility/Activity submodel.
Each HMM is associated with a particular location (l) (such
as neighborhood, city, or area), age range (e), and time
slot (h) relevant to the simulation. A detailed description of
this submodel is provided in Section 4.3. Additionally, the persistence
of active virus in various locations and environments is modeled
by the Infectious Trail submodel, which is discussed in Section
4.3.1.
