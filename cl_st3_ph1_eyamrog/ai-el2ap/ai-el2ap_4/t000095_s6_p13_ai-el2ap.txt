Therefore, reducing discrepancies between public and private healthcare findings necessitates
the allocation of resources to improve governance, enhance recruitment and
training of health teams, acquire equipment, and adapt services. Discrepancies
between public and private sectors may also be attributable to
higher morbidity among patients utilizing public services, a factor that
was not fully addressed in the analysis due to the
limited range of morbidities considered. It is well established that
individuals of lower socioeconomic status, who are more likely to
use public healthcare services, exhibit a higher prevalence of unhealthy
lifestyle behaviors. For instance, dietary data from Brazil indicate poorer
food consumption patterns among those with the lowest incomes.
