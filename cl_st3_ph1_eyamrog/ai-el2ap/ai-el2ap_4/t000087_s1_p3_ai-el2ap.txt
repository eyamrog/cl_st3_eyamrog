A total of 41 out of 164 adolescents (incidence 25.0%,
95% CI: 18.6–32.4) who attended the private indoor event developed
COVID-19. Sequencing of a sample from a symptomatic, fully vaccinated
individual (BNT162b2, Pfizer-BioNTech) identified the SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) variant of
concern. The incidence of COVID-19 was 35.1% (95% CI: 25.5–45.6)
among unvaccinated individuals and 11.4% (95% CI: 5.1–21.3) among vaccinated
individuals. A significantly higher proportion of unvaccinated adolescents developed COVID-19
compared to vaccinated adolescents (χ² = 12.6, p = 0.00).
The crude odds ratio for infection in unvaccinated versus vaccinated
individuals was 4.19 (95% CI: 1.79–9.8). Nearly all cases (40
out of 41) reported more than one symptom, with a
mean of six symptoms per individual in both groups. Common
symptoms among both vaccinated and unvaccinated cases included fatigue, runny
nose, anosmia, fever, cough, and ageusia. None of the 47
adolescents with a history of prior COVID-19 infection were reinfected
during the event. At least two known positive individuals attended
the event, while all other attendees had tested negative by
rapid antigen test 24 hours prior. The event took place
in a non-ventilated environment, lasted two or more hours, and
involved minimal mask use (87.8% unmasked), no social distancing, and
high music volume. None of the COVID-19 positive adolescents or
their close contacts who developed secondary infections required hospitalization or
died.
