The fact that I am not located in Brasilia enables
me to work without significant disturbances. Consequently, I do not
experience the same level of pressure as those based in
Brasilia who are involved in human rights policy work. I
believe that individuals working in this field in Brasilia face
greater challenges, as they are more constrained in their activities
and are unable to perform their work effectively (interview 21).
