The number and types of emojis used in online interactions
within educational contexts such as WhatsApp may be influenced by
gender and cultural factors. These findings should be considered when
designing educational initiatives on WhatsApp or other social media platforms
in multicultural settings. Recent trends indicate an increasing emphasis on
fostering social presence within learning communities and classrooms. Harn (2017)
examined the visual language of emojis and suggested that higher
education institutions incorporate emojis in informal communication to reduce social
barriers and facilitate connections with students by establishing a more
personal mode of interaction. The present research indicates that the
use of emojis contributed to an enhanced sense of social
presence during the learning process. Specifically, the inclusion of emojis
in communication was associated with a more approachable and trusting
atmosphere, which in turn increased social presence.
