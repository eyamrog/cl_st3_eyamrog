The focus of this article on the age profile of
populations and COVID-19 deaths is not due to a disregard
for other variables, such as gender and the prevalence of
comorbidities, which also influence crude mortality rates. Rather, as will
be demonstrated later, data disaggregated by these additional factors are
even more challenging to obtain. Furthermore, among the various determinants,
age exerts the most significant and decisive impact on the
risk of death.
