Each Ha is assigned a state attribute corresponding to one
of seven epidemiological compartments into which the metapopulation is divided:
S (susceptible), E (latent or exposed), I (symptomatic infectious), A
(asymptomatic infectious), R (recovered), D (dead), and H (hospitalized). Figure
2 presents a diagram illustrating the components, relationships, and parameters
of this submodel.
