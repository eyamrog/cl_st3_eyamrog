Given the incompatibility of cultural moral claims, public schools should
prioritize the promotion of truth-seeking over adopting a stance of
neutrality toward differing narratives, while still fostering reflective and critical
knowledge. In contemporary democracies, contentious issues such as those found
in bioethics, gender discrimination, and the balance between individual and
collective rights exemplify conflicting interpretations of human rights, each rooted
in distinct ontological and epistemological frameworks. In the absence of
shared principles of justice grounded in universally accepted moral reasons,
a purely narrativist approach to moral and political values—one that
is disconnected from a collective pursuit of the validity of
truth claims—cannot effectively promote social cohesion. If disparate ethical claims
are asserted without reference to common standards, cultural communities may
recognize the lack of a shared foundation for accommodating diverse
lifestyles within a single political community, which could result in
disengagement rather than active participation.
