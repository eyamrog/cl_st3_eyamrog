The research method developed in this article demonstrates applicability in
at least two distinct and relevant contexts. First, its use
at the subnational level—such as for states and municipalities—could facilitate
comparative analyses of mortality rates in a manner analogous to
its application at the international level. Second, the approach can
be updated over time and potentially extended to additional countries
as relevant data become available. Given that the dynamics of
the pandemic continue to evolve, the results derived from this
method are subject to change. For example, simply updating the
calculations to reflect the total number of deaths recorded as
of May 21, 2021, would result in Brazil moving up
four positions in the ranking of adjusted mortality rates, placing
it second only to Peru.
