Two general patterns can be observed in the relationship between
the written text and the visual elements. In some instances,
the written text precedes and introduces the characters or actions
that are subsequently depicted on the following page, as seen
on pages 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, and 26. Conversely,
there are cases in which the visual action is presented
first, followed by written text that explains the action already
depicted; this pattern is evident on pages 9, 13, 17,
21, 25, and 29.
