Elite Squad is a Brazilian film that achieved international distribution
in the late 2000s. The narrative centers on Captain Nascimento,
the leader of a specialized police unit in Rio de
Janeiro, who is assigned to combat crime using any means
necessary. A notable scene features Nascimento confronting a new recruit
who is struggling with the training regimen; during this scene,
Nascimento physically grabs the recruit by the collar, shouts at
him, and slaps him repeatedly while demanding that he "ask
to quit" ("pede pra sair"). This scene, performed by actor
Wagner Moura, has become a widely recognized meme in Brazil,
symbolizing situations in which individuals are ostensibly given a choice
to withdraw but are, in reality, subjected to coercion and
violence. Such practices in training environments reflect the enduring influence
of Brazil’s military dictatorship (1964–1985) on the methods employed in
military and police academies.
