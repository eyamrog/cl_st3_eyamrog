Although previous studies have mapped research on translation studies in
Brazil, certain gaps remain, partly because earlier research did not
have access to contemporary tools such as digital repositories due
to technological limitations. Notable examples of such studies include Pagano
and Vasconcellos (2003) and Alves and Vasconcellos (2016). This paper
addresses one of these gaps by employing a methodology that
enables the identification of research topics, trends, research centers, and
key researchers, as well as by examining sources that have
been underexplored or previously unexplored in the field.
