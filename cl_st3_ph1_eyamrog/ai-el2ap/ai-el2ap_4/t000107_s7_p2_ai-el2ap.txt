Research indicates that domain knowledge affects both the translation process
and the quality of the translated text (Scardamalia & Bereiter,
1991; Da Silva, 2007). Scardamalia and Bereiter (1991) define domain
knowledge as the understanding individuals possess regarding a specific area
or field. In the context of translation studies, domain knowledge
encompasses the knowledge, skills, and competencies relevant to translating a
text and shaping the final product. Translators often encounter texts
from a variety of specialized fields, with medical texts representing
a particularly prominent example. In such cases, familiarity with both
translation techniques and subject-specific content is essential for achieving accuracy
and quality in both the translation process and the resulting
text.
