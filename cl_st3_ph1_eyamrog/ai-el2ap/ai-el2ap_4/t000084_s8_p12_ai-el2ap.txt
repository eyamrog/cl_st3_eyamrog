Garrison et al. (1999) argue that both cognitive presence and
social presence are contingent on the presence of a teacher,
whose responsibilities include defining and initiating discussion topics and fostering
understanding. In a study utilizing peer-facilitation techniques, Chen, Lei, and
Cheng (2019) found that teacher presence can influence the level
of cognitive presence in online classes. The involvement of peer
facilitators, particularly when they posed specific types of questions, also
impacted cognitive presence. According to Braga (2007), the facilitation of
discussions in online educational settings can be distributed among course
participants, who may assume roles such as encouraging discussion, identifying
points of agreement and disagreement, and proposing new ideasâ€”functions traditionally
associated with the teacher.
