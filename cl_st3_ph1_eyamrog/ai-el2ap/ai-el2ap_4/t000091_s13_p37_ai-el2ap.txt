Clinical studies have assessed the efficacy of kava extract compared
to placebo in patients with anxiety symptoms, demonstrating a significant
reduction in these symptoms (Witte et al., 2005; Sarris et
al., 2013). Furthermore, kava extract has shown favorable outcomes across
a range of conditions, including nonspecific anxiety, tension, agitation, phobias,
generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and insomnia (Baek et al., 2014).
