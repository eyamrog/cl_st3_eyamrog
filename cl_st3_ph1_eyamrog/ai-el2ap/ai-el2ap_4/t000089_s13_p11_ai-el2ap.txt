The shift away from an in-depth examination of religious phenomena,
resulting from the expansion of the range of religions included
in the syllabus to promote impartiality toward diverse religious and
non-religious perspectives, reflects a comparable epistemological approach to knowledge acquisition
that deliberately excludes practical engagement in the evaluation of ethical
content.
