(3) Joãoi ignorou Maria enquanto Øi estava no celular. [*Johni
ignored Mary while Øi was on the phone.] In this
example, the null subject in the embedded clause is intended
to refer to the matrix subject, João. However, this interpretation
is not acceptable in Brazilian Portuguese. The sentence is ungrammatical
under the intended coreference, as indicated by the asterisk. This
suggests that, in Brazilian Portuguese, a null subject in an
embedded clause introduced by "enquanto" ("while") cannot refer to the
subject of the matrix clause.
