The evolution and integration of information and communication technologies (ICT)
in education necessitate significant modifications to curricular structures to ensure
lifelong learning for students (Hanna, 2002). This process requires the
restructuring of teaching and learning environments through the application of
pedagogical knowledge, with an emphasis on positioning the student at
the center of the educational process to support the development
of well-rounded individuals (Arag√≥n, 2007).
