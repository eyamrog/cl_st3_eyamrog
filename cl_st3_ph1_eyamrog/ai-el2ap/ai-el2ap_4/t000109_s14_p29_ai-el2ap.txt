As illustrated in the state graph in Figure 4, all
Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) considered in this study comprise four
states, each corresponding to a specific type of location or
activity: Home (C), Work (T), Leisure (E), and Others (O).
Each HMM is characterized by its own transition matrix \(A_{h,e,l}\),
which specifies the state transition probabilities \(a_{h,e,l}(i, j)\), representing the
probability of transitioning from state \(j\) to state \(i\). Additionally,
each HMM includes an emission matrix \(B_{h,e,l}\), which defines the
output probabilities \(b_{h,e,l}(k, i)\) for each state, where \(k\) denotes
the possible places an individual in state \(i\) may visit.
The initial state distribution is represented by the vector \(\pi\),
which is set to (1, 0, 0, 0) at the
start of each day, reflecting the assumption that all individuals
begin the day at home.
