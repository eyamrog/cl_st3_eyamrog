The Interpersonal Contact submodel (Section 4.1) represents the primary relationships
between human agents relevant to COVID-19 epidemiology. This submodel also
characterizes interactions among human agents, as well as their interactions
with plots of land and the environment. These relationships are
influenced by factors such as the average distance maintained in
various locations, the duration of time spent in these locations,
and adherence to mask usage and social distancing protocols (Sections
4.1 and 4.2).
