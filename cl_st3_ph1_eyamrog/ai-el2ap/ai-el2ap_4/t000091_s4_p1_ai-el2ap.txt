Herbal agents are generally regarded as relatively safe, effective, and
cost-efficient alternatives to benzodiazepines, with a lower incidence of adverse
effects. Their primary advantage lies in the ability to achieve
therapeutic effects at lower concentrations of active compounds, presenting a
potential substitute for the excessive use of conventional anxiolytics. However,
further research is required to establish their actual efficacy, optimal
dosage, and potential side effects when used for conscious sedation
in dentistry.
