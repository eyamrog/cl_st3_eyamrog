The treatments for breast cancer, as well as the psychological
and physical conditions of women during and after these interventions,
are associated with increased risks of anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue,
and sexual dysfunction. Consequently, there is significant concern regarding the
quality of life in this population. Several studies have therefore
identified quality of life as a primary outcome, with depression
and anxiety also frequently assessed, likely due to their prevalence
and the substantial impact of these symptoms on patients' overall
well-being.
