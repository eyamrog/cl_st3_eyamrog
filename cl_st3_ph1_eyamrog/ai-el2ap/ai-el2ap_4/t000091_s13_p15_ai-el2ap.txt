A double-blind clinical trial evaluated the effect of valeric capsules
on anxiety levels in women undergoing hysterosalpingography, a procedure known
to be both stressful and painful. In this study, participants
received a single dose of three capsules, each containing 500
mg of valeric (totaling 1,500 mg), administered with prophylaxis 30
minutes prior to the procedure. The results indicated that valeric
was effective in reducing anxiety among women undergoing hysterosalpingography (Gharib
et al., 2015).
