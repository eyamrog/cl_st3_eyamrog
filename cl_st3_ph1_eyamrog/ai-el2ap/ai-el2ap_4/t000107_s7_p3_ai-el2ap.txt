This study is situated within the field of translation studies
and is part of the research activities conducted by the
MapTrad research group, specifically under the Bibliometric Mapping in Translation
Studies research line. The primary objective is to systematically map
master's, doctoral, and post-doctoral research on medical translation in Brazil,
with a focus on identifying the topics addressed, the institutions
involved, and the geographic distribution of these studies. The mapping
of translation studies is expected to provide valuable information for
students and researchers interested in medical translation, facilitating informed decisions
regarding the selection of academic institutions and research areas, and
supporting the development of policies aimed at improving the allocation
of resources for translation studies in Brazil.
