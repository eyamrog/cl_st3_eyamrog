Both the Learn Together curriculum and the Diversity and Citizenship
in the Curriculum report reduce the aims of the ethical
curriculum to the expression of different worldviews, thereby neglecting substantive
engagement with ethical questions of truth and moral validity. This
approach presumes that a shared commitment to equality and human
rights is sufficient to achieve social cohesion, even in the
presence of conflicting narratives. By emphasizing commonalities between religions and
invoking human rights, these documents adopt a perspective that aligns
with certain postmodern approaches and bears similarities to some nineteenth-century
Protestant educational theories, particularly those influenced by Friedrich Schleiermacherâ€™s theological
framework, which prioritizes experiential understanding over conceptual knowledge and interprets
religious diversity as different linguistic expressions of universal human experiences
(Barnes, 2007, pp. 325-326). Such a perspective underestimates the self-constitutive
nature of cultural frameworks of reason, as distinct philosophical and
cultural systems inevitably generate incompatible moral claims.
