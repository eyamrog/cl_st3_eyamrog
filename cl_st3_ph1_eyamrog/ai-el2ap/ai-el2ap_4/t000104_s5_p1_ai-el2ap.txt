There is a lack of research on the benthic ecology
of rivers and creeks along the Atlantic coast of Brazil,
particularly within protected areas such as the Jureia-Itatins Mosaic, where
the PEIt is situated. Therefore, this study is significant as
it provides new data on water quality as well as
the composition, diversity, and status of benthic macroinvertebrates at the
Cachoeira do Para√≠so waterfall.
