The results indicate that there are no "very strong" or
"strong" correlations among the indicators within this dimension, with only
two instances of "moderate" correlation observed. This suggests a high
degree of independence among the indicators in this dimension. The
mean correlation magnitude for all indicators is 0.2451, with a
standard deviation of 0.1278. These findings support the validity of
this dimension for the group of institutions analyzed in this
study.
