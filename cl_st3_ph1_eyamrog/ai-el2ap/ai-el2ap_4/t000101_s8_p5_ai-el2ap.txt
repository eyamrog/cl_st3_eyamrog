This paper examines the question of what distinguishes policy dismantling
from routine democratic policy change in Brazil. While multiple factors
may contribute to this distinction, the research presented here focuses
on the internal dynamics and perspectives of the Brazilian federal
bureaucracy. The findings indicate that policy dismantling in Brazil has
been characterized by authoritarian practices, such as disregard for career
civil servants, the use of fear and harassment, and a
process of bureaucratic reshuffling in which bureaucrats were either removed
from their original positions or chose to leave due to
concerns about persecution.
