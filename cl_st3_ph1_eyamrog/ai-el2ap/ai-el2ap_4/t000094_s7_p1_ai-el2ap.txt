Childrenâ€™s picturebooks play a significant role in literacy development, with
both their linguistic and visual elements contributing to children's socialization
and the acquisition of cultural norms that facilitate relationship-building within
and beyond the classroom (Arizpe, Farrell, & McAdam, 2013; Evans,
2015). Through engagement with picturebooks, children simultaneously develop their ideological
perspectives and internalize social patterns as they cultivate an interest
in literature (Painter, 2018).
