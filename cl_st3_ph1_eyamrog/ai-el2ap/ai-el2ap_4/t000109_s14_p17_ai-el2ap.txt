For each Ha, the model applies the current national definition
of “close contact” [5]. Under this protocol, household members residing
with a symptomatic infected individual automatically transition from the susceptible
(S) to the exposed (E) state, irrespective of whether direct
interpersonal contact has been confirmed. Additionally, as previously described, each
Ha possesses an attribute indicating the level of mask use
observance. This attribute influences the transmission rate parameter (𝛽) through
a coefficient referred to as "mask." Specifically, the mask coefficient
reduces 𝛽 by 30% [17][21][42][43] during close contact events when
Ha demonstrates a high level of mask use observance. If
the level of observance is low, the mask coefficient is
not applied.
