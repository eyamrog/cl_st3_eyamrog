The diatom assemblage of the Xingu River over the past
approximately 6,000 calibrated years before present comprises 38 taxa, including
30 species and varieties, as well as eight taxa identified
at the genus level, representing 20 genera in total. Eight
taxa were identified only to the genus level due to
the absence of comparable taxa in the existing literature, suggesting
that they may represent taxonomic novelties. Taxa marked with a
single asterisk indicate new records for the Brazilian Amazon, while
those marked with a double asterisk represent first records for
Brazil. All taxa referenced are listed below.
