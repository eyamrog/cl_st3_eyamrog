The consumption of gases and respiratory activity of seeds and
non-seed (NS) propagules are expected to differ due to the
distinct developmental processes involved in shoot formation from each type
of propagule. Specifically, seed germination is characterized by imbibition, which
leads to increased respiration and metabolic activity, ultimately resulting in
root emergence from the seed testa (Taiz et al., 2017).
