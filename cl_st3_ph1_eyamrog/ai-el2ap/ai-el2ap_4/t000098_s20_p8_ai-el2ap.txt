Given the substantial differences in the age profiles of the
populations studied, it is expected that both the values of
age-adjusted mortality rates and the resulting country rankings differ considerably
from those based on crude mortality rates. When ranked by
age-adjusted mortality rates, the seven countries with the highest rates
are all classified as Western developing countries, specifically six Latin
American countries and South Africa. In contrast, developed countries such
as England, the United States, and Italy, which occupy the
highest positions in the ranking based on crude mortality rates,
are ranked below these seven countries when age adjustment is
applied. The relative positions within the group of countries at
similar stages of development remain largely unchanged, which can be
attributed to the comparable age structures of their populations. Finally,
it is important to note that the lowest positions in
both rankings are consistently held by the poorer Asian countries
included in the study, which, as previously indicated, exhibit substantially
lower Covid-19 mortality rates compared to the Western countries analyzed.
