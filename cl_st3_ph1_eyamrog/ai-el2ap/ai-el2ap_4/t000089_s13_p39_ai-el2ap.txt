According to Andrew Wright and Elina Hellaâ€™s (2008, p. 56)
categorisation, confessional education refers to any form of religious education
in which both the learners and the curriculum share a
common worldview. This definition encompasses not only denominational models of
religious education (RE) but also multidenominational models that seek to
examine various religious and non-religious moral frameworks. Notably, this approach
diverges from political liberalism by being grounded in a substantive
ethical framework of political principles that express tradition-constituted reasons through
worldviews and cultural perspectives. In their comparative analysis of RE
in Finland and the UK, Wright and Hella highlight that
both systems exhibit a confessional orientation insofar as Christianity occupies
a central role in the syllabuses and exerts significant influence
on the national curriculum, particularly in areas related to moral
and civic education. Furthermore, in both Finland and the UK,
students are expected to engage with religious and non-religious worldviews
to support their spiritual, moral, social, and cultural development. However,
as Wright and Hella (2008, p. 56) emphasize, confessionalism does
not necessarily involve the uncritical induction of students into a
particular worldview; rather, given that both Christianity and secular liberalism
are internally contested, education within each framework should require the
exercise of critical judgement.
