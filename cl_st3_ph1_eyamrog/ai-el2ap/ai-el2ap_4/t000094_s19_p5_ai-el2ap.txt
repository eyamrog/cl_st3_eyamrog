On page 18, a pattern similar to that on page
6 is evident, with several objects prominently displayed on the
floor, specifically a pair of glasses, a crown, and a
dress-up box. The same images, along with a bookshelf, are
present in the left background. The written text is positioned
centrally on the wall, except for the final two lines,
which are located on the carpet. On the following page,
the three characters are situated on the carpet, with Daddy
positioned at the center, wearing a small pink dress. This
central placement and attire draw attention to Daddy, emphasizing his
significance within the scene due to his wearing of traditionally
feminine clothing.
