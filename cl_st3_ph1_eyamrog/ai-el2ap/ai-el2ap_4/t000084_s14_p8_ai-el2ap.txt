At the beginning of the course, all participants completed a
presurvey to assess their attitudes toward mobile devices, as well
as a demographic questionnaire. The course was conducted over an
eight-week period and facilitated through WhatsApp. The instructional tasks were
structured around three main components: (i) familiarization with various mobile
applications, including specific WhatsApp functions (such as location sharing, audio,
and text messaging), and identification of common genres on mobile
platforms (e.g., selfies and memes); (ii) development of materials utilizing
the functionalities of mobile devices, such as cameras and GPS;
and (iii) discussions on pedagogical approaches that can be integrated
into mobile learning (m-learning). At the conclusion of the eight-week
period, all participants completed a postsurvey to reassess their attitudes
toward mobile devices.
