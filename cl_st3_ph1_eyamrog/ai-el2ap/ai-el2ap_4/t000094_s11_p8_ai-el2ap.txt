Visual elements play a crucial role in these types of
texts, as they contribute to the communication of values, ideas,
and examples that are significant in the narrative process. Furthermore,
it is essential to analyze visual components in conjunction with
the written text to understand how both modes of communication
complement each other and interact to construct meaning within the
picturebook (Kümmerling-Meibauer, 2014). Previous research has examined how children develop
multiliteracies from an early age (Lewis, 2001; New London Group,
2000; Moya Guijarro & Ruiz, 2016; Pinar & Moya Guijarro,
2016; Unsworth, 2014). Additionally, several studies highlight the importance of
visual elements in storytelling and in conveying underlying ideologies (Hamer
et al., 2017; Kümmerling-Meibauer et al., 2015).
