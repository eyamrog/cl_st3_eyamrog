This submodel incorporates an attribute for each Ha that represents
the level of adherence to social distancing, designated as "distancing,"
which can take one of two values: high or low.
When an Ha exhibits a high level of observance, it
evaluates any potential position on the geographical grid, excluding its
home, to ensure that no other agent is present within
a 1.8-meter diameter. If this condition is satisfied, the Ha
occupies the position; otherwise, it waits until the spatial capacity
permits entry. Conversely, if the distancing attribute is set to
low, the Ha moves to the selected position without regard
for the allowed capacity or the presence of other agents.
