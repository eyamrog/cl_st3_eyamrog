The findings indicate that native speakers of Portuguese generally employ
the Position of Antecedent Strategy when resolving ambiguous anaphora, with
Brazilian speakers more frequently interpreting zero anaphora as referring to
the subject of the main clause compared to European Portuguese
speakers. For participants from both language varieties, pronominal cataphora appears
to present greater difficulty in resolution than other types of
anaphora. While the majority of participants selected either the subject
or the complement of the main clause as the antecedent
of the anaphor, a subset of participants identified an alternative
referent—one not previously mentioned in the sentence—as the antecedent in
cases of pronominal cataphora, a pattern also reported in Italian
by Sorace and Filiaci (2006).
