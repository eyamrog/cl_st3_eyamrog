The initial search on the BDTD website was conducted using
the simplified keyword search interface (Figure 2). The term "tradução"
(translation) was entered into the search field, following the same
procedure used on the Domínio Público website. This search yielded
4,849 theses and dissertations, a volume that rendered individual selection
unfeasible. Consequently, a more targeted search strategy was implemented. The
keywords "tradução médica" (medical translation) and "tradução artigo científico" (scientific
article translation) were subsequently used. The resulting records were reviewed
individually, and those that met the inclusion criteria were documented
in an Excel spreadsheet.
