To evaluate the number of shoots per propagule, a separate
batch of NS and seeds was cultivated in 250 mL
flasks containing 40 mL of MS/5 culture medium and maintained
in a growth room under a 12-hour photoperiod, at 25±2
°C, and with an irradiance of 30 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹.
Shoot production was assessed at 15-day intervals during in vitro
culture for up to 75 days, using 15 plants per
time point (five plants per flask, with a total of
three flasks).
