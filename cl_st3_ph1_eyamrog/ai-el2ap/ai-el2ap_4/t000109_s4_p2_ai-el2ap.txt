The results obtained are consistent with data reported by various
official sources, including PMUC, particularly regarding the number of ICU
beds allocated for COVID-19 patients in the city. Additionally, the
model outputs align with the reported number of deaths during
the period under consideration. These findings indicate that the model
is suitable for predicting the short-term evolution of case numbers
and ICU bed occupancy.
