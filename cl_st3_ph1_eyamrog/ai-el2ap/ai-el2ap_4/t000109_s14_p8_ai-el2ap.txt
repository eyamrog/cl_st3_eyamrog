This submodel incorporates characteristics specific to the COVID-19 pandemic, including
key epidemiological effects associated with asymptomatic infectious individuals (A) and
those exhibiting mild symptoms. It also accounts for the proportion
of individuals requiring hospitalization in intensive care (H). The model
assumes that all human agents have access to respiratory ventilators,
as the healthcare capacity in the city under study was
not exceeded during the period analyzed.
