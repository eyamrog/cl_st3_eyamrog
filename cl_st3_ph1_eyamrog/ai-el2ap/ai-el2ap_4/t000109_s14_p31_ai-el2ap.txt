This location corresponds to Ha’s residence and, as such, has
a single possible outcome. The precise position on the city’s
geographical map that serves as the output for this state
is specified as an attribute for each Ha and is
incorporated into the Location submodel. This attribute is randomly selected
from a designated habitable area of the city at the
start of the simulation and remains constant throughout the duration
of the simulation.
