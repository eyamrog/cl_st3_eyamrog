The mapping presented in this paper will contribute to the
ongoing research conducted by the MapTrad research group at the
University of Brasilia. Existing mappings by this group include studies
on game translation and localization (Barcelos & Malta, 2020), didactics
of translation, translation studies focused on children and adolescents, Spanish-Portuguese
translation, and black feminist translated literature.
