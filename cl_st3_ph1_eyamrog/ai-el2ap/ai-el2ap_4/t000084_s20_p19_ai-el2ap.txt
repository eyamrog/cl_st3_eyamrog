Another factor contributing to the high frequency of emojis identified
as indicators of social presence is the near real-time communication
enabled by WhatsApp, which allows users to respond to messages
instantly. This functionality may have facilitated participants' ability to demonstrate
engagement in ongoing interactions, often through brief messages containing emojis
or solely emojis, particularly given the time constraints faced by
teachers. As noted by Pegrum (2014), the core of mobile
learning lies in on-demand or just-in-time interactions, which are typically
characterized by brevity and an optimal amount of information.
