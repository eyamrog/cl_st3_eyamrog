Therefore, in light of the circumstances described above, there is
a clear need to establish a postgraduate program. This program
should aim to advance the development of education in Ecuador
by proposing a curricular design that enables teachers across various
educational levels to acquire the competencies necessary for the effective
integration of technology into the learning process. Additionally, the program
should seek to improve student academic outcomes by promoting pedagogical
approaches that recognize students as active, critical, and reflective participants
in the acquisition and management of information, which is increasingly
essential in contemporary educational contexts.
