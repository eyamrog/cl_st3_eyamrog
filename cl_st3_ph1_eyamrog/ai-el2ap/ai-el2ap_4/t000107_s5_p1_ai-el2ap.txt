As outlined in the Introduction, the present study aimed to
replicate the methodology proposed by Alves and Vasconcellos (2016) for
mapping medical translation studies theses and dissertations written in Portuguese
and completed at higher education institutions in Brazil. Alves and
Vasconcellos (2016) based their approach on the assumption that such
theses and dissertations were required to be made digitally available
at www.dominiopublico.gov.br, in accordance with Article 1 of CAPES administrative
regulation 13/2006. However, a review of the regulation indicated that
it does not mandate a specific website, but rather stipulates
that the works must be “available to the public through
the internet.” Additionally, our search identified a thesis completed in
2002, which predates the initial period considered by Alves and
Vasconcellos (2016). Therefore, considering the increased robustness of current search
engines, we established 2002 as the starting point for our
search period.
