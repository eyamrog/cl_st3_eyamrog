Paleolimnological studies have been demonstrated to be effective tools for
reconstructing environmental biodiversity and floristic changes (e.g., Smol 2008; Bennion
& Simpson 2011; Davidson & Jeppesen 2013; Wengrat et al.
2018). Furthermore, data derived from past environmental communities frequently represent
the only available source of information for assessing biodiversity prior
to anthropogenic impacts (Smol 2002; Le Treut et al. 2007).
