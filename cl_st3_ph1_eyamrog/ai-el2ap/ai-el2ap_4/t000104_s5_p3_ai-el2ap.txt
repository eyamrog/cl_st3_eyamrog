The sedimentological data did not reveal any significant differences between
the sampling sites, suggesting that variations in taxon distribution along
the sites were not attributable to sedimentological factors. Instead, the
observed similarity in sediment characteristics across sites may account for
the comparable composition of benthic assemblages. The organic matter content
in the Cachoeira do Paraíso sediment was consistent with values
reported by Cunha and Calijuri (2008) for lotic environments in
proximity to the present study area in Iguape, SP. As
in the current study, Cunha and Calijuri (2008) attributed the
low organic matter content to several factors, including high-energy flow
conditions. It is important to note that the river regime
at Cachoeira do Paraíso waterfall is highly dependent on rainfall,
with intense rainstorms substantially altering environmental conditions and contributing to
the instability of the river system. During periods of heavy
rainfall, benthic organisms are likely to be displaced and transported
downstream, which may explain the observed characteristics of the samples.
