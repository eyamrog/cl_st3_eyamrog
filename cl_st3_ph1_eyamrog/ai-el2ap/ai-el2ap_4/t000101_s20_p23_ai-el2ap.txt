On the same day, the official Twitter account of the
Presidency (@planalto) tagged Lorenzoni and announced: “We will review issues
related to [participatory] Councils. In the executive order, the Conselhão
[Economic and Social Development Council] has already been dissolved. We
will conduct a detailed review (pente fino) of all councils
within the federal administration.” In Brazilian Portuguese, the term “pente
fino,” which literally translates to “fine-tooth comb,” refers to a
thorough and rigorous process of examination intended to identify irregularities.
