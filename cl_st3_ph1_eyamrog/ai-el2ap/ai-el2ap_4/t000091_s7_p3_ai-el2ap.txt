To address this issue and manage patient anxiety, both pharmacological
and non-pharmacological interventions are available. If non-pharmacological methods alone are
inadequate, sedation techniques may be employed to achieve the desired
level of anxiety control (Gordon et al., 2013; da Cunha
et al., 2021). Minimal sedation, as defined by the American
Dental Association, refers to a minimally depressed level of consciousness
in which the patient is able to maintain airway control
independently and respond appropriately to physical stimulation and verbal commands
(Mancuso et al., 2004; da Cunha et al., 2021).
