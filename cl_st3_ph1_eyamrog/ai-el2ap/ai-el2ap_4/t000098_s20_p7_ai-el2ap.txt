The primary objective of this article is to calculate adjusted
mortality rates to account for differences in the age composition
of populations. The results of these calculations, conducted using the
methodology outlined in the previous section, are presented in Table
3, which includes data from all 28 countries for which
age-disaggregated mortality statistics were available. It is important to note
that the effectiveness of the adjustment can be evaluated by
examining the correlation coefficients between an indicator of population aging
and both crude and adjusted mortality rates. Specifically, the correlation
between the percentage of the population aged 60 and over
and the crude mortality rate is positive and relatively strong
(0.573). In contrast, the correlation between the same aging indicator
and the adjusted mortality rate is substantially lower (-0.252), indicating
that the adjustment procedure effectively reduces the influence of population
age structure on mortality rate comparisons.
