This study provides the first data on the composition of
the macroinvertebrate community in the Cachoeira do Paraíso waterfall, which
is formed by the Itinguçu River (PEIt, SP, Brazil), as
well as an assessment of the water quality in this
system. The measured physical-chemical parameters were consistent with those typically
observed in rivers located within strictly protected areas and showed
little variation across all sampling sites. The sediments were predominantly
sandy, with low concentrations of organic matter and CaCO₃. Classical
ecological indices, exploratory analyses, and a biomonitoring index all consistently
indicated that the water quality in the Cachoeira do Paraíso
waterfall ranged from good to excellent. Furthermore, the biomonitoring approach
based on the assessment of benthic macroinvertebrates was demonstrated to
be appropriate for evaluating streams in protected areas along the
Atlantic coast of Brazil.
