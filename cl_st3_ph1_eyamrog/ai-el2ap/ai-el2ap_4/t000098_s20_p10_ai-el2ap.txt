A comprehensive analysis of the factors contributing to the observed
discrepancies in adjusted mortality rates among countries falls outside the
scope of this article. Apart from the age distribution of
populations, which is accounted for in the calculation of adjusted
mortality rates, all other determinants influencing disease incidence and lethality
also impact these rates. Notably, the present study identifies a
clear inverse association between health expenditure levels and adjusted mortality
rates among Western developing countries. This relationship is illustrated in
Figure 2, where the horizontal axis represents current per capita
health expenditure, expressed in US dollars adjusted for purchasing power
parity, and the vertical axis displays the adjusted mortality rate.
The size of each sphere corresponds to the absolute number
of deaths in each country.
