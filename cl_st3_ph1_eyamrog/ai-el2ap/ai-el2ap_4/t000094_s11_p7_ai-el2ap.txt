As the term suggests, the primary defining features are the
medium, which is a book, and the content, which consists
of images. The term "picturebook" does not explicitly indicate the
inclusion of text; however, there is general consensus that picturebooks
typically contain both images and written text. In academic discourse,
a distinction is often made between books in which the
text predominates over the illustrations and those in which there
is a more balanced integration of textual and visual elements,
with picturebooks generally exemplifying the latter.
