Previously, I was involved in the conception and design of
public policies. Currently, I do not perceive opportunities for such
work, as it is no longer feasible. Individuals with my
profile are excluded from participation in Ministry F. The approach
has shifted, and my current role involves activities in area
G, which are more indirect and do not produce immediate
outcomes. This work consists of documenting and recording the ongoing
changes and reversals, thereby contributing to the institutional memory (interviewee
16).
