Demonstrating physical contact or expressing affection is linked to emerging
forms of masculinity. The promotion of egalitarian masculinity is considered
essential for the development of new family models that diverge
from the traditional model of hegemonic masculinity, which has frequently
characterized conventional heterosexual families. The conceptualization and representation of these
new masculinities, in both heterosexual and homosexual couples, present a
challenge to the patriarchal system, which is fundamentally based on
a social structure that allocates greater power and privileges to
men and is supported by an ideology that legitimizes this
arrangement.
