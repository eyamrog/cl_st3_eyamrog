International comparison of mortality rates has been one of the
primary tools for monitoring the dynamics of the Covid-19 pandemic
since its onset. Given the well-established exponential relationship between age
and Covid-19 lethality, it is necessary to use indicators that
adjust for differences in population age structures. This article presents
a method for calculating standardized mortality rates that account for
both variations in age distribution and age-specific mortality rates across
populations. Building on the limited number of similar approaches in
the literature, this method is applied to a sample of
28 countries that, as of January 28, 2021, represented 82%
of global Covid-19 deaths. The resulting age-adjusted mortality rates reveal
patterns that differ substantially from those indicated by crude mortality
rates, identifying three distinct mortality profiles. Notably, six Latin American
countries and South Africa occupy the highest positions in the
ranking based on these adjusted rates. Furthermore, an updated calculation
using data up to March 26, 2021, shows that Brazil
ranks third, following only Mexico and Peru, in age-adjusted Covid-19
mortality.
