The global expansion of protected areas is frequently motivated by
the necessity to safeguard habitats and species that are threatened
or in critical condition (Borrini-Feyerabend et al., 2017); however, water
conservation is often neglected in this process. Regardless of the
specific conservation objectives, it is essential to estimate and monitor
the carrying capacity of protected areas to ensure the effective
preservation of the targeted ecosystems (Jallian et al., 2012).
