The second and most significant contribution of this study is
the calculation of adjusted mortality rates, which are derived from
age-specific mortality rates and the age distribution of populations. This
adjustment, previously recommended by demographers focusing on the topic [QUEIROZ
et al., 2020: 3689], is essential for controlling the effects
of differences in population age structures and for enabling the
appropriate use of mortality rates in evaluating the effectiveness of
pandemic response measures [GOLDSTEIN & LEE, 2020: 5]. Although at
least two prior studies have addressed this issue, the present
analysis offers important advancements, either due to its broader spatial
and temporal coverage compared to one study [VILLANI et al.,
2020] or its more comprehensive methodological approach relative to the
other [HEUVELINE & TZEN, 2021]. The findings presented here allow
for the construction of an international ranking of Covid-19 mortality
that differs substantially from rankings based on crude rates. Furthermore,
the adjusted rates demonstrate that the presumed “protective” effect of
younger demographic profiles in lower-income countries [GUILMOTO, 2020: 8; DOWD
et al., 2020: 9,697] was insufficient to prevent several Latin
American countries and South Africa from experiencing some of the
most severe impacts of the pandemic. The primary reason for
this, as identified in this study, is the presence of
distinct age-specific mortality patterns in developing countries, particularly the higher
mortality observed in younger age groups.
