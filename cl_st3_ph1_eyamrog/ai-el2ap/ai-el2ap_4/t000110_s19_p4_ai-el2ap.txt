The population observed exhibits a valve outline similar to that
of Staurosira construens Ehrenberg (1843), but is distinguished by its
narrower ends. Staurosira sp. was identified in 82% of the
core samples, with a maximum relative abundance of 24%. This
species is present in samples ranging from the end of
the Mid-Holocene, approximately 6,000 calibrated years before present (cal. yr
BP), to the top of the core.
