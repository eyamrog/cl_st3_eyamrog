Baroreflex function can be assessed through time-domain analysis, which includes
measures such as the mean of RR intervals, standard deviation,
and the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD). Additionally,
heart rate variability can be analyzed in the frequency domain
using the Fourier transform, which provides valuable information. This approach
yields the low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) indices, and the
ratio of LF to HF is commonly used to represent
the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic (vagal) activity.
