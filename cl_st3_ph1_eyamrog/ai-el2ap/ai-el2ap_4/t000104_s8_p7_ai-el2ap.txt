In developing countries such as Brazil, many protected areas lack
management plans, which increases the urgency for research to generate
knowledge and inform effective management strategies. The Jureia-Itatins Mosaic of
Protected Areas exemplifies this situation, as it currently does not
have a management plan and requires additional scientific data to
support its conservation. This region is located within the Atlantic
Forest biome, recognized as a biodiversity hotspot and a conservation
priority due to its status as one of the largest
remaining fragments of preserved Atlantic tropical rainforest in Brazil. However,
it has experienced significant habitat loss as a result of
urban expansion and agricultural activities in surrounding areas (Cerati &
Zanini, 2009).
