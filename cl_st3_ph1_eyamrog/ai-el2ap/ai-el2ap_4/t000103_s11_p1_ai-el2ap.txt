King and Lewis (2018, p. 1) define anaphora as “the
phenomenon whereby the interpretation of an occurrence [the anaphor] of
one expression depends on the interpretation of an occurrence of
another [the antecedent].” The anaphor and its antecedent may occur
within the same sentence or across different sentences, and the
anaphor may either precede or follow its antecedent in the
discourse. When the anaphor follows its antecedent, this is referred
to as forward anaphora or simply anaphora (see example 1).
Conversely, when the anaphor precedes its antecedent, this is known
as backward anaphora or cataphora (see example 2). In this
study, the term anaphora will be used to refer to
both anaphora and cataphora when the distinction between them is
not pertinent.
