With respect to denominational schools, it is important to recognize
that an ethical-dialogical approach to religious education (RE) requires consideration
of religious claims from diverse faith communities. In addition to
their own RE classes, which primarily serve to socialize students
into a specific spiritual tradition as described by Rorty, these
schools should also facilitate opportunities for interfaith dialogue. Since faith
narratives are constructed in relation to alternative conceptions of worldly
and spiritual realities, there is no justification for exempting religious
communities from engaging with differing spiritual claims to the same
extent that they engage with scientific frameworks of rationality. Accordingly,
just as students are expected to critically evaluate scientific theories
such as those of Newton and Einstein, they should also
be encouraged to assess the validity of various faith beliefs.
Although initial engagement with unfamiliar traditions may require a suspension
of judgment to understand their underlying rationalities, increased familiarity may
enable students to determine which tradition offers more satisfactory responses
to practical or theoretical issues identified through introspective analysis.
