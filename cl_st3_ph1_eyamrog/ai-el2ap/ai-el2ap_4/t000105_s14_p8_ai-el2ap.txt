A three-stage cluster sampling design was employed. In the first,
second, and third stages, census sectors were selected randomly and
without replacement. Within each selected census sector, households were chosen
using a systematic sampling method. Subsequently, one resident from each
selected household was randomly chosen using the “Sorteador de Nomes®”
application [15].
