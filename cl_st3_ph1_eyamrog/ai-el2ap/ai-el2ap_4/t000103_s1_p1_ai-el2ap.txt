This study investigates (a) differences in ambiguity resolution among English,
Spanish, and Portuguese; (b) the influence of learnersâ€™ first language
(L1) on ambiguity resolution in a second language (L2); and
(c) the effects of clause order, (d) anaphor salience, and
(e) verb choice on this process. A total of 181
participants completed an online survey in which they selected the
antecedent of the anaphor in 16 ambiguous sentences. The Position
of Antecedent Strategy was evaluated across the three languages, and
the results indicate that this strategy is applicable to both
European and Brazilian Portuguese, but not to Spanish or English.
Native speakers of Spanish and English generally interpret the subject
of the subordinate clause as corresponding to the subject of
the main clause, whereas L2 learners are influenced by their
L1 and exhibit particular uncertainty in resolving pronominal cataphora. The
findings also demonstrate that semantic factors significantly affect the resolution
of ambiguous anaphora in these languages, and it is recommended
that such factors be considered in the design of similar
studies.
