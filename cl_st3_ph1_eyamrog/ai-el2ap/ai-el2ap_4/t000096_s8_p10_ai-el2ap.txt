The ongoing interactions among individuals and their surrounding environments—including situations,
problems, models, and systems—were taken into account. Additionally, the study
evaluated the role of information and communication technologies (ICT) in
educational processes, with all considerations directed toward problem-solving and the
promotion of sustainable societal development.
