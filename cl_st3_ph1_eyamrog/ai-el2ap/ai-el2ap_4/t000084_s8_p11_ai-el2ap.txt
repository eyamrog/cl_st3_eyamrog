Garrison and Arbaugh (2007) report that research on student group
cohesiveness and interaction in team settings indicates a significant relationship
between social presence and learning outcomes. Drawing on studies by
Molinari (2010), Celani and Collins (2005), and Beuchot and Bullen
(2005), they further argue that social presence serves as a
foundation for cognitive presence (Whiteside, 2015). More recent studies, including
those by dâ€™Alessio et al. (2019) and Rolim et al.
(2019), corroborate these findings by demonstrating strong associations between social
presence and cognitive presence.
