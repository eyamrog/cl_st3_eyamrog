The rates of O2 consumption and CO2 release in seeds
of A. strobilacea reached their maximum at 14 days of
culture (Figure 3), which coincided with the stage of complete
seedling formation (Figure 2). In contrast, the respiratory rates in
nodal segments (NS) peaked at 7 days (Figure 3), exhibiting
values five times higher than those observed in seeds and
occurring prior to the detection of leaf emergence at 14
days. These results indicate that NS exhibit a more pronounced
and earlier demand for energy generation via respiration compared to
seeds during the initiation of plant formation. The excision of
nodes and the consequent release from apical dominance are known
to stimulate cytokinin accumulation in the excised tissue, which promotes
cell proliferation in lateral buds and the formation of new
shoots (Souza et al. 2010; Buchanan et al. 2015; Li
et al. 2018). As a result, respiratory activity is expected
to increase to meet the energy requirements for cell division
during shoot formation and the multiplication process (Siqueira et al.
2018). Additionally, it has been reported that sugar accumulates in
NS cultured in vitro, facilitating bud outgrowth and providing substrates
necessary for respiration to support intensive cell division (Schneider et
al. 2019). A comparable pattern has been described for the
bromeliad Ananas comosus (Souza et al. 2010). The higher respiration
rates observed in NS compared to seeds may also be
attributed to the occurrence of multiple bud breaks in NS
(Table 1, Figures 1b and 1c).
