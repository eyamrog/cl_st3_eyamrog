The subsequent analysis focuses on the statistical correlations among the
various Indicators and Dimensions of the “U-Multirank.” This aspect is
critical, as high correlations between multiple Indicators would suggest redundancy,
indicating that the 36 Indicators may not represent distinct measures
but rather overlapping constructs assessed through different questions. Such redundancy
would challenge the validity of the “U-Multirank” results and undermine
its claim to multidimensionality, which constitutes the primary innovative feature
of this ranking system.
