This study presents a floristic survey and an analysis of
diatom distribution over the past approximately 6,000 years, based on
two sediment cores collected from the Xingu River in Pará
State, Brazil. The Amazon Basin comprises about 40% of Brazil’s
national territory and contains more than 60% of the country’s
available freshwater resources (PNRH 2006). Covering approximately 7 million km²,
the basin occupies two-fifths of South America and 5% of
the Earth's surface, making it the largest drainage basin globally
and a critical region for the maintenance of biodiversity (Wetzel
et al. 2011). In this context, the present study aims
to expand knowledge of tropical diatom biodiversity prior to significant
human impact and to contribute new records for Brazil and
the Brazilian Amazon.
