The researchers (JS and VBL) conducted searches in the specified
databases and subsequently organized the selected articles based on their
titles and abstracts. Articles that did not align with the
study objectives were excluded. Following this initial screening, the remaining
articles were reviewed in full to finalize the selection of
studies to be included in the analysis (Figure 1).
