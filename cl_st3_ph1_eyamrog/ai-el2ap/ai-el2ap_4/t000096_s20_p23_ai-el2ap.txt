Face-to-face teaching is characterized by direct, in-person interaction between teachers
and students, which facilitates immediate feedback, non-verbal communication, and the
ability to adapt instructional strategies in real time based on
students’ responses. In contrast, the role of the teacher in
the digital age increasingly involves the use of technology to
deliver content, monitor student progress, and provide support through digital
platforms. While digital environments can enhance accessibility and flexibility, they
may limit opportunities for spontaneous interaction and require teachers to
develop new competencies in digital literacy, online communication, and the
management of virtual learning environments. Consequently, the teacher’s role has
expanded from traditional instruction to include the facilitation of online
learning, the curation of digital resources, and the support of
students’ independent learning skills.
