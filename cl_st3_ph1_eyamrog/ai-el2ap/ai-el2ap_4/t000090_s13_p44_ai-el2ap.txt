There are eleven additional correlations classified as “moderate,” as presented
in Table 5. Overall, the mean magnitude of all indicators
within this dimension is 0.3515, with a standard deviation of
0.1763. This represents the highest average among all dimensions; however,
it is not sufficiently high to suggest redundancy among the
indicators. Consequently, these results support the validity of this dimension
for the group of institutions examined in this study.
