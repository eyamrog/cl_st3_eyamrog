Second, based on the demand analysis conducted in a previous
phase, which also supports the rationale for this master's program
proposal, an online questionnaire was administered to 130 individuals, including
teachers and graduates in the field of education, and distributed
via email. The results indicated that 90% of respondents expressed
interest in enrolling in a master's program focused on ICT-mediated
learning management, and 49% reported a preference for pursuing such
a program in an online format.
