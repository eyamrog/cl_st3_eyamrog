In this context, teachers have the opportunity to integrate learning
theories such as constructivism with digital and telematic resources. This
integration facilitates the transformation of traditional, static pedagogical models to
address the evolving demands of contemporary educational environments, which require
more dynamic approaches to enhance the quality of teaching and
learning processes. Such an approach aims to promote an educational
framework that encompasses learning to learn, learning to do, learning
to live together, and learning to be (Mart√≠, 2010).
