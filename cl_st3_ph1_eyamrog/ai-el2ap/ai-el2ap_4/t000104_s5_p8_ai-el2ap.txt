In this study, the tolerant group consists of organisms from
the order Ephemeroptera, which are characterized by relatively long life
cycles and a degree of sensitivity to variations in physicochemical
parameters of the aquatic environment, including conductivity, nitrate concentration, and
dissolved oxygen (Timm, 1997; Hrovat et al., 2009). Hrovat et
al. (2009) demonstrated that water body depth influences the distribution
of Ephemeroptera. These organisms are frequently found in lotic environments,
where they can reach high densities; however, spatial heterogeneity, particularly
proximity to stream banks, plays a significant role in their
distribution (Hrovat et al., 2009). In the Cachoeira do Para√≠so
waterfall, Ephemeroptera were recorded at sampling points P1 and P3,
but only at low densities.
