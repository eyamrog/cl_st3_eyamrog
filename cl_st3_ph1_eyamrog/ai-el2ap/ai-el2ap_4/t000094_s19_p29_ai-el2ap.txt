Pages containing written text receive particular attention. Visually, importance is
conveyed through the use of distinct patterns. In certain instances,
characters are arranged according to a centrifocal-polarised pattern, appearing in
two separate corners of the pages, specifically on pages 7,
11, 16, 20, 23, 27, and 28. In contrast, other
instances depict characters aligned in a linear, iterative pattern, as
observed on pages 8, 12, 15, 19, and 24. When
characters are arranged in lines, the visual composition centers on
a single focal point. Conversely, in the centrifocal-polarised pattern, multiple
focal points are present, which are visually connected by directional
vectors.
