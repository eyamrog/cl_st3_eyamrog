One possible explanation for the disparity in Covid-19 mortality between
Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo is the difference in
the availability of hospital beds. São Paulo has a higher
number of hospital beds per 100,000 population compared to Rio
de Janeiro (27.8 and 23.3, respectively). However, during the period
evaluated, the average time between diagnosis and hospitalization was similar
in both cities, approximately 5 days (5.8 days in Rio
de Janeiro and 5.9 days in São Paulo).
