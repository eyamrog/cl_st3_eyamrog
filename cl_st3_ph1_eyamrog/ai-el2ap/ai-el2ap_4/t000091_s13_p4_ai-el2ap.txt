There is increasing interest in phytotherapy among both healthcare professionals
and patients. Medicinal plants are recognized as rich sources of
bioactive compounds with potential therapeutic effects for the treatment of
anxiety (Liu et al., 2015; Fajemiroye et al., 2016). However,
there is a lack of comprehensive information available to healthcare
professionals regarding the appropriate use of phytotherapy, which contributes to
uncertainty about its efficacy. To address this gap, it is
necessary to provide evidence-based information through scientific dissemination, thereby promoting
the safe and effective use of phytotherapy and supporting its
integration into clinical practice (Sarris et al., 2013).
