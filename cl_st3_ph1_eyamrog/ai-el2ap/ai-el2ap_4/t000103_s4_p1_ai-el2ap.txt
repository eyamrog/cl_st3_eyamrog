This study builds upon previous research (Bruscato & Baptista, 2022a,
2022b) and aims to investigate: (a) the differences in ambiguity
resolution strategies among English, Spanish, and Portuguese; (b) the extent
to which L2 learners' ambiguity resolution is influenced by their
first language; and (c) whether factors such as the order
of main and subordinate clauses, the salience of the anaphor,
or the lexical choice of verbs affect ambiguity resolution.
