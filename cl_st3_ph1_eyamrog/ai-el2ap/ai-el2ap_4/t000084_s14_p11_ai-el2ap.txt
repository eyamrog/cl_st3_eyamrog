To address the second research question regarding the relationship between
participants’ attitudes and their emoji use, Spearman’s rho analyses were
conducted using participants’ posttest scores and their recorded emoji use.
Due to attrition, only 61 participants completed both the pretest
(which included demographic information) and the posttest; consequently, analyses related
to emoji use were limited to these 61 participants for
the second and third research questions. For the third research
question, which examined the associations between age, gender, and emoji
use, Spearman’s rho analyses were performed to assess the relationship
between age and emoji use, while independent samples t-tests were
conducted with gender as the independent variable and emoji use
as the dependent variable.
