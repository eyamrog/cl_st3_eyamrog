To ensure comprehensive identification of relevant studies, an additional search
was conducted on the BDTD website using the keywords "tradução
artigos científicos" (translation scientific articles). This search yielded 427 studies,
of which only three theses met the established selection criteria.
The results of this search are presented in Figure 6.
