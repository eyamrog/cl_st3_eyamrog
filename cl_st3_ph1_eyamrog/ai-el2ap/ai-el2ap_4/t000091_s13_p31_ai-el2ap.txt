Dantas et al. (2017) found that oral administration of Passiflora
incarnata (260 mg) or midazolam (15 mg) 30 minutes prior
to the extraction of impacted mandibular third molars resulted in
comparable anxiolytic effects. Passiflora incarnata was demonstrated to be safe
and effective for conscious sedation in adult patients undergoing oral
surgery, indicating its potential as a pharmacological alternative for the
management of anxiety during dental treatment.
