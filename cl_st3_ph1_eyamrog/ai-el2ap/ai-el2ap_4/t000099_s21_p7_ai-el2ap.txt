Given the established roles of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production and carbohydrate mobilization in seed germination and bud outgrowth
(Considine & Foyer 2014; Taiz et al. 2017; Signorelli et
al. 2018), it would be beneficial to examine the effects
of redox status and carbohydrate composition during shoot development from
seeds and non-seed structures (NS) of A. strobilacea. Such investigations
could yield further insights into the developmental differences observed between
these two modes of shoot generation.
