In accordance with the perspectives of Wright and Hella, I
propose a model of religious education (RE) in which both
religious traditions and secular worldviews contribute to a process of
moral learning. This approach contrasts with a neutralist framework of
public reason by promoting pupilsâ€™ autonomous thinking through the communication
and critical evaluation of substantive ethical claims of justice in
a pluralistic environment. To avoid conflation with confessional RE, which
is typically associated with religious schools, I classify as tradition-oriented
those conceptions of RE that support the integration of substantive
cultural values into educational practices. Within this classification, I distinguish
between the denominational model of schooling and an ethical-dialogical model
of RE, the latter referring to multidenominational approaches that foster
interfaith dialogue through the articulation of comprehensive beliefs and experiential
knowledge. While both models can be situated within a tradition-oriented
conception of RE, I argue that ethical-dialogical education is better
positioned to fulfill the requirements of context-transcendent rationality, as defined
by Maeve Cooke.
