At the conclusion of the data collection period, the database
was consolidated by merging the three survey stages conducted in
both cities. A consistency analysis was performed to assess data
reliability, identify potential typographical errors, and detect missing values. The
sampling weight for each selected unit—census tract, household, and individual—was
calculated separately for each city, based on the inverse probability
of selection as specified in the study’s sampling plan and
using data from the 2010 demographic census. Adjustments were made
to account for non-response, and the weights for households and
selected residents were calibrated to ensure that the population totals
by sex and age group (18–29 years, 30–49 years, 50–59
years, and 60 years and older) aligned with the 2019
population projections provided by DATASUS [22].
