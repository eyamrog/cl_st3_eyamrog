The Xingu River basin, one of the principal eastern Amazonian
river systems (Figure 1a), covers an area of 531,250 km²
and exhibits an average discharge ranging from 2,582 to 9,700
m³ s⁻¹. The region has a tropical climate, with mean
annual temperatures between 25°C and 27°C (ISA 2012). The downstream
section of the Xingu River, known as the Volta Grande
do Xingu (Xingu Great Bend; Figure 1c), is characterized by
an atypical river course and diverse morphological features. Near its
mouth, the river transitions into a lowland Amazonian system with
a single, slack-water channel influenced by tidal activity (Sawakuchi et
al. 2015). For this study, samples were collected from the
lower Xingu River in a floodplain lake (3°12’51.24”S, 52°11’24.25”W) located
on Arapujá Island (Volta Grande do Xingu), as well as
from a ria area (01°42’32.12”S, 52°16’47.42”W) near the city of
Porto de Moz.
