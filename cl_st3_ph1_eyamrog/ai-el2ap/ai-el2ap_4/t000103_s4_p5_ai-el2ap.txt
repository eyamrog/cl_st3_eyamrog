When learning a foreign language, native speakers of Portuguese appear
to be influenced by their first language anaphora resolution strategy
(PAS), irrespective of their proficiency level in the second language.
In Spanish, Brazilian learners are more likely than European learners
to interpret zero anaphora as referring to the subject of
the main clause. Nevertheless, learners exhibit some uncertainty in selecting
the antecedent of pronouns in Spanish, particularly in cases involving
cataphora, as well as in English.
