The anxiolytic effects of medicinal plants are primarily mediated through
interactions with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in
the central nervous system (CNS). These interactions may involve modulation
of GABA receptor binding, direct effects on ion channels, alterations
of cell membrane properties, inhibition of GABA transaminase, or inhibition
of glutamic acid decarboxylase. The resulting enhancement of GABAergic neurotransmission
suppresses excitatory neural pathways, thereby producing an overall anxiolytic effect
(Baldwin & Polkinghorn, 2005; Manayi et al., 2016; Sarris et
al., 2018; Farah et al., 2019).
