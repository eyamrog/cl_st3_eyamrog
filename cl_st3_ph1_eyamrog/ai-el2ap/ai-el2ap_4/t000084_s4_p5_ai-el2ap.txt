The use of this type of communication has the potential
to enhance learning experiences across various training and educational contexts.
It is necessary to systematically evaluate and develop collaborative educational
communication methods that align with current realities, with careful consideration
of their pedagogical implications to improve the overall learning environment.
As diverse forms of language and expression emerge in these
settings, both educators and students should recognize how cultural differences
influence meaning-making during interactions. For example, interactional norms that are
considered appropriate in Brazil may be perceived as inappropriate in
other cultural contexts, and the interpretation of emojis can also
vary significantly across cultures. Increasing awareness of these potential differences
represents an important consideration for the development of netiquette guidelines
in future educational initiatives.
