Over time, several controversial ministers were replaced by either more
moderate and lesser-known individuals or by military officers. Nozaki (2021,
p. 10) documents a significant increase in the number of
military officers holding political appointments in the Bolsonaro administration, rising
from 2,765 in the final year of the Temer government
to 6,157 in 2020 under Bolsonaro. At the time of
Nozakiâ€™s study, ten ministers were members of the military. Nozaki
(2021) characterizes this trend as the militarization of public administration
in Brazil.
