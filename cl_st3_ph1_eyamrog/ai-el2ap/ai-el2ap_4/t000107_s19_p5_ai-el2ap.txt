The search conducted on the BDTD website using the keyword
"tradução" retrieved 4,849 theses and dissertations. Given the impracticality of
manually screening such a large number of records to identify
studies that met the selection criteria, the search was refined
by using the keywords "tradução médica" (medical translation), which yielded
633 studies (see Figure 5). Of these, only six studies—three
dissertations and three theses—met the established selection criteria.
