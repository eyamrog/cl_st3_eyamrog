Both the Irish and English educational systems recognize the importance
of the religious dimension in human development and the connections
between spiritual and moral education. This emphasis, which is associated
with the relationship between spiritual education and community values at
both local and national levels, marks a notable shift from
a neutralist approach. However, the diverse experiences of religious education
in both countries indicate that variations in curriculum structure can
either facilitate or impede intercultural learning and dialogical critique.
