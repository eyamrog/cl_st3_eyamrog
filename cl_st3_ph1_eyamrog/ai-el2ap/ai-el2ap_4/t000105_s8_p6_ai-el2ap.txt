Immunochromatographic tests for antibody detection are a valuable tool for
epidemiological surveillance, as they facilitate the identification and interruption of
virus transmission chains and support health surveillance activities focused on
enhanced monitoring and individual care, including the implementation of preventive
measures [8-10]. In this context, a seroepidemiological survey was conducted
to determine the prevalence and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as
well as the subsequent socioeconomic and health effects, in the
populations of two medium-sized cities in the Inconfidentes region of
Brazil. This paper details the methodological procedures employed in the
study and presents estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence within the
target population.
