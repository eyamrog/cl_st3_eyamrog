The narrative is presented from Emily’s perspective, with the pronoun
‘I’ serving as the predominant thematic element. Visually, Emily’s prominence
is reinforced by her frequent placement in the foreground, either
on the right side or in the center of the
page. Notably, there are no images in which Emily appears
alone, indicating that the narrative’s primary focus is on depicting
her interactions and activities with her fathers. The illustrations generally
depict the characters in full-length, medium-sized figures that occupy a
substantial portion of the page.
