The protection of aquatic ecosystems, particularly rivers, is essential for
meeting human needs and preserving environmental integrity (Stolton & Dudley,
2003). Various mechanisms exist to safeguard riparian zones and water
sources, including legal frameworks such as the protection of riparian
forests mandated by the Brazilian Forest Code (Brasil, 2012), as
well as the establishment of protected areas. These measures are
designed to maintain water quality, conserve biodiversity, support ecological processes,
preserve forest remnants, and ensure the continued provision of environmental
services (Magini & Abessa, 2017).
