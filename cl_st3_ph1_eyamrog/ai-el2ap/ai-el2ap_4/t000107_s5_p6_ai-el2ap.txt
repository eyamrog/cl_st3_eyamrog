As previously noted, one of the files required for analysis
could not be located. Among the sub-areas of medicine represented
in the studies, cardiology and general biomedicine were the most
prevalent, each serving as the focus of five studies. Additional
sub-areas identified in the theses and dissertations included anesthesiology, orthopedics,
cardiovascular surgery, arterial hypertension, physiology, geriatrics, gerontology, nutrition, and pharmacy.
The distribution of these sub-areas is presented in Figure 11.
Regarding language pairs, the majority of studies involved Portuguese-English (10
studies) and Portuguese-German (2 studies). Additionally, one dissertation examined multilingual
translation involving Portuguese, Spanish, and English.
