The introduction of information and communication technologies (ICT) in education
has led to significant changes in pedagogical and didactic paradigms,
primarily due to the expanded opportunities they provide for communication,
access to and management of information in various digital formats,
and enhanced human-computer interaction, among other factors (Area, Gros, &
Marzal, 2008).
