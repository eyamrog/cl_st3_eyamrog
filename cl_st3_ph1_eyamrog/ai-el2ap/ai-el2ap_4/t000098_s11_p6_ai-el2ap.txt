The literature review identified two studies with central objectives similar
to those of the present article, specifically in promoting adjustments
to Covid-19 mortality rates. Villani et al. (2020) calculated comparable
age-standardized mortality rates, but their analysis was limited to five
European countries and utilized data available only up to August
30, 2020. More recently, Heuveline and Tzen (2021) conducted a
geographically broader study, encompassing 186 countries and several subnational units
significantly affected by the pandemic. However, despite its extensive geographical
coverage, their study employed a less comprehensive method for adjusting
mortality rates. Specifically, the “indirect” standardization approach they used accounts
for differences in age structure but assumes a uniform age-specific
mortality pattern across all countries and localities, based on the
pattern observed in the United States. While the authors justify
this method in contexts where data limitations preclude “direct” standardization,
they also acknowledge the limitations of this approach, particularly regarding
variations in mortality rates among older age groups across countries.
The present article aims to address these limitations by proposing
a more comprehensive adjustment procedure applicable to a wide range
of countries.
