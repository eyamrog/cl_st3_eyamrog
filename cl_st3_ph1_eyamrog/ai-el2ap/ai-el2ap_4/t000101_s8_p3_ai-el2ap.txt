The distinction between ordinary policy change and policy dismantling is
not always clearly defined. It is necessary to consider whether
policy dismantling should be understood merely as a form of
policy change that typically occurs following a change in administration,
with the intent to reverse the policies of previous governments.
Additionally, it is important to assess whether policy dismantling represents
a specific subset of policy change characterized by negative connotations,
thereby potentially challenging the presumed neutrality of established theories of
the policy process (Sabatier & Weible, 2014).
