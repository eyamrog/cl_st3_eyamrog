Da Cunha (2021) conducted a randomized, triple-blind clinical trial involving
200 asymptomatic patients scheduled for impacted lower third molar extraction.
The study aimed to compare the anxiolytic effects of 15
mg midazolam, 500 mg Passiflora incarnata, and 500 mg Erythrina
mulungu, as well as a placebo, with participants randomly assigned
to one of four groups, each receiving a different intervention
60 minutes prior to surgery. Anxiety levels were evaluated using
standardized questionnaires and physiological measurements. The results indicated that Passiflora
incarnata produced anxiolytic effects comparable to those of midazolam, whereas
neither placebo nor Erythrina mulungu demonstrated efficacy in controlling preoperative
anxiety in this patient population.
