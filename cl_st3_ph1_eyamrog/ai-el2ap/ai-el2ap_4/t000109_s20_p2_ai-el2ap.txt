Figure 5 presents a comparison between the number of ICU
beds occupied by COVID-19 positive patients, as reported by the
Critical Units Monitoring Program (Programa de Monitoreo de Unidades Críticas,
PMUC) of Entre Ríos province during the study period, and
the corresponding estimates generated by the model. This information is
essential for anticipating potential strain on the local healthcare system.
Furthermore, the data set is considered reliable, as it can
be obtained from real-world observations with a high degree of
accuracy. The figure demonstrates that the weekly reports of ICU
bed occupancy by COVID-19 patients are consistent with the values
produced by the model.
