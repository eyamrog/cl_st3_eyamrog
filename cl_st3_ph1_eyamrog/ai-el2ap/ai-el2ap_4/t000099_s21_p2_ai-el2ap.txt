NS exhibited shoot multiplication after two weeks of culture (Table
1, Figures 1b and 1c), a response that was not
observed in seeds (Table 1, Figures 1d and 2e). By
35 days of culture, however, seedlings demonstrated greater leaf elongation
as well as increased number and length of roots compared
to NS plants (Figure 2). The enhanced root and leaf
growth in seedlings may be attributed to the mobilization of
nutrient reserves from the seed, which supports plant development until
the seedling becomes nutritionally autonomous (Taiz et al. 2017). In
contrast, shoot multiplication in NS is likely a result of
multiple bud breaks following the release of apical dominance after
node excision from the mother plant (George et al. 2008).
