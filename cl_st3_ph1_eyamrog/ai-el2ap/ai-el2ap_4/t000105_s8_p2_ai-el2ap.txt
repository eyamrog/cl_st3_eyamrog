In Brazil, insufficient coordination and management by the federal government
in implementing pandemic control measures have resulted in many municipalities
independently making key epidemiological surveillance decisions to prevent the spread
of the virus within their jurisdictions. In this context, challenges
related to the diagnostic and notification processes, shortages of human
resources in health services and epidemiological surveillance sectors, and limited
availability of diagnostic tests have significantly hindered accurate assessment of
the true prevalence of both the disease and the infection
