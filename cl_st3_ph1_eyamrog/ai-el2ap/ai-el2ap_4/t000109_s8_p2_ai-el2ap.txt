According to recent epidemiological reports, the COVID-19 pandemic exhibits characteristics
that are uncommon among other infectious diseases [6]. Notable features
of COVID-19 include a high basic reproduction number (R0) of
up to 2.79 [7], an asymptomatic infectious period lasting up
to 14 days during which individuals may not display symptoms
and infection can only be identified through serological testing, and
considerable variability in both the duration and clinical outcomes of
the disease [8]. Evidence indicates that the dynamics of the
epidemic are influenced primarily by factors such as climate [9],
local social and health practices [10][11], comorbidities [12], and age
distribution [13], among other variables. The wide range of factors
affecting the progression of the pandemic necessitates the development of
more complex and realistic computational models that incorporate specific characteristics
relevant to each region under study, rather than relying solely
on conventional mathematical models. In response, this paper introduces a
novel model that integrates local variables, including social, cultural, geographical,
and climatological factors, which are associated with the epidemic and
its transmission dynamics.
