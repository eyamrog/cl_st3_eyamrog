Due to the instant and on-demand nature of interactions via
WhatsApp, teaching presence was demonstrated not only by the instructors
but also by course participants who were available and willing
to contribute. Throughout the course, the Mobile Phone emoji was
consistently used by teachers and tutors when interacting with the
group. This approach aimed to help participants easily identify posts,
tasks, or interventions originating from the instructors, thereby facilitating the
recognition of a specific digital genre. Since the use of
this emoji was a predetermined pedagogical strategy rather than an
emergent feature of participant interaction, it was not coded as
teaching presence and was excluded from related analyses.
