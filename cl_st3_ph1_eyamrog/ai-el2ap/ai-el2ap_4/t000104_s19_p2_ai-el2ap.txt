The sediment textural analysis of samples collected at the Cachoeira
do Para√≠so waterfall indicated a predominance of coarse and very
coarse sands (Table 2). The standard deviation values suggest poor
grain sorting, as the sediments also contained both pebbles and
very fine sands. These findings are consistent with sediments that
are proximal to their source area (McCave and Syvitski, 1991).
Furthermore, the dominance of coarser grains is characteristic of high-energy
environments influenced by strong water flow, which is typical of
waterfall settings. Overall, these sediments were generally found at shallow
depths relative to the total water column (Bujan et al.,
2019).
