This state denotes the work or study location assigned to
each human agent (Ha). Multiple human agents may share the
same geographical point on the map. For some agents, particularly
those who do not work or study, this location coincides
with their home. The work or study location for each
agent is fixed throughout the simulation and is determined at
the start of the run from a predefined list of
possible places. The probability of each location being selected varies
according to the age range of the human agents.
