After obtaining the percentages presented in the tables from SPSS,
multiple t-tests were conducted to identify factors influencing the choice
of antecedent in the sentence pairs. The results indicated that
Portuguese speakersâ€™ responses were significantly affected by the salience of
the anaphors across the three languages at the 0.001 significance
level, provided there was no semantic opposition to the Position
of Antecedent Strategy. In contrast, native speakers of Spanish and
English were not significantly influenced by either the order of
the clauses or the salience of the anaphors. However, participants
from all language groups were significantly influenced by the semantic
relationship between the verbs (p < 0.03). Additionally, no significant
differences were observed among students from different Portuguese varieties or
among those with varying proficiency levels.
