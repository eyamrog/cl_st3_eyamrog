The results for the “neutral” and “biased” sentences differed substantially.
While Portuguese speakers continued to exhibit susceptibility to PAS, particularly
when the anaphor was an ellipsis in either Portuguese or
Spanish, the data indicate that both the lexical selection of
verbs and the semantic relationship between them significantly affect the
resolution of ambiguous anaphora. This factor has been largely overlooked
in prior research. Based on these findings, it is recommended
that the semantics of verb combinations be taken into account
when constructing ambiguous sentences for anaphora resolution tasks.
