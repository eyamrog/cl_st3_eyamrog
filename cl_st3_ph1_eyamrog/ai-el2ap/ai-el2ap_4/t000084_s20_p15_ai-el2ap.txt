assume the role of teacher, which is particularly beneficial in

and high volume of messages often require participants to be
readily available to take on instructional responsibilities, as illustrated in
the excerpts above. The organization and facilitation of class management
and instruction indicate that social presence is a significant factor
in supporting teaching presence.
