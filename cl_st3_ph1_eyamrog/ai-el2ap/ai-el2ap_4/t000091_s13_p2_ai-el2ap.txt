Recently, plant-based psychopharmacology has attracted considerable attention from researchers. Various
mechanisms of action have been identified for medicinal plants used
in the treatment of depression, anxiety, and insomnia, including the
inhibition of monoamine reuptake, modulation of neuroreceptor and transporter channel
activity, and regulation of neuronal communication or the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
(Liu et al., 2015).
