Here, P(t) denotes the probability of contact with the virus
via a plastic surface, where t represents the time in
hours since the fomite was last handled, and temp indicates
the daily mean temperature. This formula was incorporated into the
GIS system projection, assigning each cell in which an infected
individual (Ha) was present a corresponding probability P(t) of transmitting
the infection to another individual (Ha). This factor was included
to ensure model completeness, as it is associated with various
hygiene measures implemented to prevent disease transmission. However, both practical
experience and recent literature indicate that this factor has no
significant impact on overall transmission dynamics.
