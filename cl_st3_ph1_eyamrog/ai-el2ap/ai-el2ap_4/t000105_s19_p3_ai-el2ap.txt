Figure 2 presents the distribution of census sectors in the
urban areas included at each stage of the survey, based
on data from the IBGE. The selection process accounted for
the proportionality of the number of households and average income,
thereby ensuring the representativeness of different socioeconomic levels both in
the final sample and at each stage of the survey.
