Drawing on the case of Brazil under the Bolsonaro administration,
this paper identifies specific characteristics that distinguish policy dismantling from
routine policy change. In Brazil, policy dismantling has been characterized
by authoritarian practices that have disrupted the functioning of the
federal bureaucracy. The bureaucracy serves not only as a central
component of the stateâ€™s administrative apparatus but also as an
autonomous group of actors within the policy process (Bauer, Peters,
and Pierre, 2021). The resulting disorganization within the bureaucracy has
contributed to both the systematic dismantling of federal policies and
the weakening of policy capacity at individual and institutional levels
(Wu et al., 2018). Accordingly, this paper addresses the need,
as articulated by Bauer, Peters, and Pierre (2021), for further
examination of the relationship between populist governments exhibiting democratic backsliding
and the public bureaucracies within their states.
