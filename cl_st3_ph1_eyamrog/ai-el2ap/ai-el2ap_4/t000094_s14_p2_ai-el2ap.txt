Regarding the categories for analysis, Painter et al. (2013) identify
layout, framing, and focus as key elements for examining the
compositional meaning of picturebooks. This analytical framework is based on
the work of Kress and van Leeuwen (2006), who investigate
information value, salience, and framing to deconstruct textual meanings. Consequently,
the present analysis will primarily focus on these elements to
provide insight into the narrative structures of both picturebooks.
