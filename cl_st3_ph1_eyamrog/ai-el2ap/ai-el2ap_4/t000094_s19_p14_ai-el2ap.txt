The remaining themes include ‘our adventures’, ‘the kitchen’, ‘the park’,
and ‘a game’, which refer to activities involving Emily or
the locations where these activities occur. Notably, approximately 25% of
the themes are marked, characterized by the presence of a
textual element preceding the topical theme. These marked themes occur
before conjunctions such as ‘and’ or ‘but’, the adverbial ‘sometimes’,
the prepositional phrase ‘On a damp and rainy day’ (page
14), as well as elements like ‘there’, ‘then’, and ‘so’.
