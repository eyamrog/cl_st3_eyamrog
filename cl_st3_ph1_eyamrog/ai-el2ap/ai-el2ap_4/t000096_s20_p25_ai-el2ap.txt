Although the concept of information literacy was introduced in 1974,
it is now regarded as a fundamental competency for participation
in the knowledge society, as it encompasses the ability to
recognize the need for information, identify appropriate sources, evaluate the
quality and relevance of information, and use and communicate information
in a critical, reflective, and ethical manner (GÃ³mez, 2007).
