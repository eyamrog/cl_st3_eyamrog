The data collection process involved listing and contacting households, recruiting
participants, collecting venous blood samples, and conducting interviews. These activities
were conducted on weekends (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) to facilitate
the participation of residents who were employed during the week,
thereby increasing the representativeness of this population group.
