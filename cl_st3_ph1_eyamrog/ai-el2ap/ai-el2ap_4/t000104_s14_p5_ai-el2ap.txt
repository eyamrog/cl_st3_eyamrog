Normative Ordinance 144/2010 of Fundação Florestal establishes a daily visitor
limit at Cachoeira do Paraíso waterfall, currently set at 180
for independent visitors and 90 for organized groups. This restriction
aims to mitigate potential environmental impacts on the preserved area
and to ensure that public access to the waterfall serves
as a means of environmental education. Although the presence of
restaurants near the visitor center provides economic benefits to the
local population (Magini & Abessa, 2017), it may also result
in negative environmental effects, such as water pollution from improper
waste disposal and increased river siltation, both of which can
adversely affect local biota.
