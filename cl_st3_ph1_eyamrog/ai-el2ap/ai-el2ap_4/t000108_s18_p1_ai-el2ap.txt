For this study, specimens deposited at the CESJ herbarium (acronyms
following Thiers 2020) were examined. These specimens were compared and
analyzed for their macro- and micromorphological characteristics, as well as
their geographical and ecological data. The taxonomic treatment was conducted
in accordance with the most recent phylogenetic studies of the
tribe Melastomateae (Michelangeli et al. 2013; Guimarães et al. 2019).
Species of Tibouchina s.s. and related genera from Brazil were
identified using taxonomic keys provided by Silva et al. (2014)
and Guimarães and Silva (2014). The distribution map was generated
using ArcGIS software version 9.3 (ESRI 2008). Conservation assessments were
performed following the criteria established by the International Union for
Conservation of Nature (IUCN 2019).
