On January 3, 2019, Onyx Lorenzoni, who had recently assumed
the position of Minister of the Center of Government (Casa
Civil), announced via Twitter: “We will fire all political appointments
working at Casa Civil. We have to have people who
are committed to what we represent”12. The large-scale dismissals on
the third day of the administration reflected the underlying assumption
that none of the individuals previously employed by the federal
government could be aligned with the priorities or values of
the new administration.
