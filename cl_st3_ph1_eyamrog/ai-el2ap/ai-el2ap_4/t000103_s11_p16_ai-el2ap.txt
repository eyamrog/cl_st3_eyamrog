In this study, we examine the performance of the PAS
with English and Spanish learners and native speakers, as well
as with native speakers of Brazilian Portuguese (BP) and European
Portuguese (EP). Previous research (Duarte, 2000; Holmberg et al., 2009;
Kempchinsky, 1984) has identified Brazilian Portuguese as a partial null-subject
language, meaning that it permits null subjects, but under more
limited conditions compared to consistent null-subject languages such as European
Portuguese (Holmberg et al., 2009, p. 1). Consequently, the process
of ambiguity resolution may vary between these language varieties.
