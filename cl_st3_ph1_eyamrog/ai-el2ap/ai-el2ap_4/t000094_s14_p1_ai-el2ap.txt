The methodology employed in this article is primarily qualitative and
descriptive, as the analysis focuses on a single picturebook. Due
to space constraints, the study is limited to an examination
of the compositional metafunction, while the remaining metafunctions will be
addressed in future research. The analysis centers on the textual
metafunction as defined by Halliday (1978) and Halliday and Matthiessen
(2014), which is also referred to as the compositional metafunction
by Painter et al. (2013). Specifically, the study investigates the
relationships between the written text and visual elements within the
selected picturebook (see Section 4).
