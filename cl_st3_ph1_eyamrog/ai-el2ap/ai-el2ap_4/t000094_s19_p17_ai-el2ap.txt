Analysis of the visual representation of Dad and Daddy as
visual themes indicates that the written theme “This is my
Dad, and my Daddy” consistently corresponds with the depiction of
Dad on the right side of the page. In the
eight instances where both fathers appear with Emily simultaneously, Dad
and Daddy each serve as the visual theme on the
right side four times, demonstrating an equal distribution. Furthermore, as
previously noted, whenever Dad and Daddy are referenced as the
written theme, Dad is always mentioned first.
