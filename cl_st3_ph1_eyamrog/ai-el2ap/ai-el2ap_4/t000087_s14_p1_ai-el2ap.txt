In May 2021, a private event was held in Mexico
City for high school adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.
The event took place in an enclosed, unventilated room. Attendance
required a negative COVID-19 rapid antigen test result obtained within
24 hours prior to the event. All vaccinated participants had
received their vaccinations in the United States, as COVID-19 vaccines
were not available for adolescents in Mexico at that time.
Following the event, multiple cases of COVID-19 were identified among
attendees. All participants were subsequently asked to undergo COVID-19 testing
within one week of the event. A sample from a
symptomatic, fully vaccinated individual was selected for sequencing to identify
the SARS-CoV-2 genetic variant.
