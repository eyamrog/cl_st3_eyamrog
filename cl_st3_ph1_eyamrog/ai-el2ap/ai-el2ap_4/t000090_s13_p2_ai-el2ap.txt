Following the introduction of this ranking, additional international university rankings
were established, including the “Webometrics Ranking of World Universities” (http://www.webometrics.info/en;
Aguillo, Ortega, and Fernandez, 2008) in 2004 and the “THE-QS”
ranking, also launched in 2004. In 2010, the “THE-QS” ranking
was divided into two separate rankings: the “Times Higher Education
World University Rankings” (THE) (https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings) and the “QS World University
Rankings” (QS) (https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings). Subsequently, numerous countries developed regional or national
rankings, primarily because international rankings often do not include smaller
or local academic institutions from all regions worldwide (Righetti, 2019;
Shin and Toutkoushian, 2011).
