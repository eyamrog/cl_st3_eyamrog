At the more radical end of this perspective is Stanley
Hauerwas’s theological adaptation of a communitarian approach to virtue ethics.
Originating from a Protestant background, Hauerwas offers a strong critique
of Christian movements that pursue alliances between the Church and
the state. Drawing on the work of John Howard Yoder,
Hauerwas approaches any attempt to exert religious control over the
political sphere with skepticism, arguing that the priorities of the
state—such as effectiveness and security—are frequently incompatible with the virtues
required by faith. He contends that when Christians attain political
power, they are compelled to modify moral discourse to accommodate
individuals who are not formal members of the Church. As
Hauerwas observes, “servanthood and love of enemy, contentment and monogamy,
cannot be expected of everyone. So, a duality develops in
ethics between ‘evangelical counsels’ for the motivated and ‘precepts’ for
everyone else” (Hauerwas, 1988, p. 122). Furthermore, Hauerwas expresses concern
that efforts to support secular governments may force Christians to
choose between the gospel’s emphasis on self-sacrifice and the nation’s
demands, such as participation in war. Consequently, he opposes state-sponsored
religious activities and maintains that religious citizens should not seek
political power to alter societal values, but should instead focus
on cultivating the virtues necessary to achieve their communitarian objectives
within the Church.
