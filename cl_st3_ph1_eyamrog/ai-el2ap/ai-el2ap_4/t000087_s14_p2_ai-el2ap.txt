A questionnaire was distributed to all high school adolescents invited
to the private event (N=199), with only those who attended
the event included in the study sample (N=164). Informed consent
was obtained at the beginning of the questionnaire, and for
participants under 18 years of age, parental consent was requested
in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines (World Health Organization,
2021). Participants were informed that their involvement in the study
was both anonymous and voluntary. Additionally, an open virtual meeting
was held with adolescents and their parents to explain the
studyâ€™s objectives and methodology. The questionnaire consisted of closed-choice items
and one open-ended question, and collected data on age, sex,
history of prior COVID-19 infection, COVID-19 rapid antigen test status
before the event, COVID-19 test results after the event, use
of face masks, duration of attendance at the event, vaccination
status, symptoms experienced after the event, and the occurrence of
COVID-19 among close contacts following the event.
