It has been proposed that English exhibits a tendency to
interpret a pronoun in subject position as referring to the
subject of the main clause (Chambers & Smyth, 1998; Crawley
et al., 1990), as illustrated in (6), except when the
pronoun is stressed. In cases where the pronoun in subject
position is stressed, it is generally interpreted as referring to
an entity distinct from the subject of the main clause
(Luj√°n, 1986; Smyth, 1994), as shown in (7). This pattern
is considered analogous to the distinction observed in null subject
languages between the use of zero anaphora (null pronouns) and
pronominal anaphora (unstressed overt pronouns).
