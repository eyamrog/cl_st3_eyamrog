In diseases where lethality is strongly correlated with age, the
overall mortality rate within a population is determined not only
by age-specific mortality rates but also by the population's age
structure. This is illustrated by the observation that the four
countries with the highest overall mortality rates in Table 1—England
and Wales, Italy, Hungary, and Spain—do not have the highest
mortality rates in any age group below 70 years, where
the highest rates are consistently observed in Latin American countries
or South Africa. Conversely, in the age group of 80
years or older, three of the four highest mortality rates
are found in developed countries, with the exception of Colombia,
which has the second highest mortality rate in this age
group.
