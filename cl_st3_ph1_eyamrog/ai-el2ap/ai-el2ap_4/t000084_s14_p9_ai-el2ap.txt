Upon completion of the 8-week course, transcripts from each group
were exported from WhatsApp and compiled into an Excel spreadsheet.
The written interactions served as contextual data for analyzing the
use of emojis, which were categorized as indicators of cognitive,
teaching, or social presence. All emojis appearing in the group
interactions were coded according to the Community of Inquiry (CoI)
categories and indicators, as detailed in Table 1. When one
or more emojis were used independently within an interaction, coding
was determined based on the content of the discussion at
the time of posting. The coding of interactions across the
six groups (Group 1: 1962 posts; Group 2: 1895 posts;
Group 3: 1180 posts; Group 4: 1436 posts; Group 5:
1303 posts; Group 6: 1492 posts) was subsequently verified by
two of the articleâ€™s authors.
