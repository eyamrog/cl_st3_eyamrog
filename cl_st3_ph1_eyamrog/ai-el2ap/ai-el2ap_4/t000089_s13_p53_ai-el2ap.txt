The Irish education system is primarily denominational, with the provision
of religious education (RE) largely managed by specific churches and
religious organizations. The national Constitution stipulates that this structure is
intended to uphold freedom of conscience and religion by enabling
parents to raise their children according to their chosen faith.
Additionally, this arrangement reflects a broad recognition of the significance
of RE for citizens, with the option to opt out
serving as an exception rather than the standard, although the
delivery of RE remains organized along denominational lines.
