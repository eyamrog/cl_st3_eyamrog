One of the nasopharyngeal samples collected from a symptomatic, fully
vaccinated individual was sequenced and identified as the Delta variant
of concern (VOC), which, according to the June report by
the Consorcio de Vigilancia Genómica in Mexico, accounted for only
2.12% of samples screened at that time (Programa de Vigilancia
Genómica, no date). Although it is not possible to attribute
the superspreading event solely to this VOC, given that at
least two positive individuals attended the event, the detection of
the Delta variant is notable, as it may provide insight
into the variant’s capacity to infect adolescents regardless of vaccination
status, particularly in the absence of mitigation measures. Furthermore, this
study contributes to the understanding of Delta’s potential to cause
breakthrough infections, despite the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine demonstrating 100% efficacy
in phase 3 trials involving adolescents when other variants were
predominant (Frenck et al., 2021). Consistent with previous reports, Delta
variant infections have been found to predominate among vaccine breakthrough
cases in countries such as India and the United Kingdom,
likely due to a combination of reduced neutralizing antibody effectiveness
and increased viral infectivity (Mlcochova et al., 2021).
