The interdisciplinary scope of this research, particularly its intersection with
the medical field—hereafter referred to as domain knowledge—underscores the relevance
of studies such as the present one. Previous research has
demonstrated that domain knowledge influences both the translation process and
its outcomes (Da Silva et al., 2009; Da Silva &
Silveira, 2017). Efforts to map specific areas within translation domains
have been conducted (Barcelos & Malta, 2020; Esqueda, 2020) with
the aim of contributing to knowledge dissemination and identifying the
most and least explored topics. The mapping undertaken in this
study follows a similar approach by identifying topics that attract
the greatest interest among translation studies researchers in Brazil and
by highlighting potential gaps in existing knowledge.
