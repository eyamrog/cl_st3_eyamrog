Both Ceratopogonidae and Odonata populations may be affected by periods
of rainfall and drought, as well as by various physicochemical
parameters of the water, including conductivity, temperature, pH, and turbidity
(Bulánková, 1997; Yanoviak, 1999a). The larval development of many Odonata
species is closely associated with water temperature; for example, Lutz
(1968) proposed that 20 °C represents a limiting temperature for
Odonata in temperate environments, although the corresponding threshold for tropical
and subtropical rivers remains undetermined. In the present study, Odonata
were recorded exclusively at site P1.
