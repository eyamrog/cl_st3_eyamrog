The pragmatist/postmodern educational framework offers the advantage of incorporating studentsâ€™
specific experiences in faith-related activities as a foundational element of
the educational process. However, although this approach diverges from the
objectivism characteristic of liberal perspectives, it does not establish a
clear epistemological or ontological basis for systematic critical thinking and
self-critique. By prioritizing the individual and social utility of self-directed
practices and neglecting a comprehensive account of public morality, this
framework is susceptible to the paradox wherein an autonomous thinking
agent, exercising personal freedom, may choose disengagement and adopt a
conservative position on ethical and moral issues.
