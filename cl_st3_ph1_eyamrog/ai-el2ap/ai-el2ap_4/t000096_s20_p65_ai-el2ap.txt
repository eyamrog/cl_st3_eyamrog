Therefore, it is essential that teachers are equipped to educate
future generations, necessitating the implementation of training programs aimed at
developing digital competencies. These competencies enable teachers to facilitate and
manage learning processes, conduct effective assessments with the support of
information and communication technologies (ICT), integrate innovative didactic strategies in
the classroom, promote educational research, and engage in ongoing reflection
and professional development to ensure the effective integration of these
skills into teaching practice (Gutiérrez, Prendes, & Castañeda, 2015).
