The research was conducted within the context of an eight-week
continuing education course designed to explore the use of mobile
devices in language learning. This course, which was part of
a project organized by the School of Letters at a
prominent university in Brazil, was offered to in-service K-12 English
teachers from various regions of the country. Owing to the
large number of participants (N = 227), six groups were
established and facilitated concurrently.
