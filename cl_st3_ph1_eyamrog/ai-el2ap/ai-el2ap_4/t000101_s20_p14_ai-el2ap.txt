During my tenure, all of my colleagues have left the
agency. Of my former team, only one individual remains, but
he has transferred to work with policy A, leaving the
B program. He reports that he is now in a
more tranquil environment and maintains a certain distance from former
colleagues. Another colleague has moved to Institute C, while another
has joined Institute D. As a result, former team members
are now dispersed across various agencies. Currently, they all maintain
a low profile and are focused on their remaining time
until retirement, refraining from making any public statements or expressing
opinions (interview 30).
