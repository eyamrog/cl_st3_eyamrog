Valerian has been reported not to potentiate the effects of
alcohol or central nervous system (CNS) depressants, does not impair
the ability to drive vehicles or operate machinery, and does
not induce physical or psychological dependence (Ugalde et al., 2005).
However, other studies have indicated that valerian-based phytotherapeutic preparations may
interact with barbiturates and benzodiazepines, potentially enhancing the therapeutic effects
of these drugs and increasing CNS depression (Hendriks et al.,
1985; Leuschner, MÃ¼ller, & Rudmann, 1993).
