The results indicate that there is no "very strong" correlation
among the indicators; however, two indicators exhibit a "strong" correlation.
Specifically, "Patents awarded (absolute numbers)" and "Patents awarded (size-normalized)" demonstrate
a correlation coefficient of 0.8077. This suggests that institutions with
high performance in generating new products tend to score well
on both indicators. The high correlation also implies a substantial
degree of redundancy between these two indicators.
