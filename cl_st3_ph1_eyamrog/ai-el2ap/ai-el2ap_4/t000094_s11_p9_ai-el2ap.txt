Painter et al. (2013) propose a model for analyzing multimodal
meanings in picturebooks that focuses on representational, interpersonal, and compositional
meanings, drawing on the visual grammar framework developed by Kress
and van Leeuwen (2006). Representational meanings address the relationships among
participants, objects, the actions they undertake, and the contextual settings
in which these actions occur. Interpersonal meanings examine the social
relationships between interactants by considering factors such as distance, gaze,
and perspective. Compositional meanings concern the relationships among the various
elements within the discourse.
