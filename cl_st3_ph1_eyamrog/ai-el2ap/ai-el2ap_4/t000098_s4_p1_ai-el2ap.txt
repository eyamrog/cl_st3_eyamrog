This article makes two primary contributions to the analysis of
the global spread of Covid-19. First, it systematizes data on
mortality rates by age group for 28 countries that, as
of January 28, 2021, accounted for 82% of Covid-19-related deaths.
This dataset is significant, as no existing source is known
to provide age-disaggregated mortality information with comparable geographic coverage. Utilizing
these data, it is possible to assess whether the well-documented
increase in lethality with age is consistent across different countries,
a question previously raised by Villani et al. (2020). The
analysis reveals notable cross-country differences, with at least three distinct
patterns emerging.
