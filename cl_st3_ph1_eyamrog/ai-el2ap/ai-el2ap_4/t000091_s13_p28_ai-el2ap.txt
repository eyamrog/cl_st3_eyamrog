Movafegh et al. (2008) conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical
trial involving 60 patients who were randomly assigned to receive
either 500 mg of Passiflora incarnata or a placebo as
premedication 90 minutes prior to surgery. The study assessed anxiety,
sedation, and psychomotor function. The authors concluded that oral administration
of Passiflora incarnata as a pre-anesthetic medication significantly reduces anxiety
without causing sedation.
