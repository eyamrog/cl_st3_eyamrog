The concept underlying the creation of “U-Multirank” is that there
is no universally applicable “best” or “top 10” classification of
academic institutions worldwide. The selection of the “best” university is
subjective and depends on the individual goals and constraints of
prospective students. In accordance with this approach, a multidimensional ranking
system should identify the main criteria (referred to as Dimensions)
and establish methods for evaluating these criteria (through Indicators and
the rules for their calculation). Academic institutions are categorized into
five quality groups for each Indicator, based on the specified
evaluation rules. Classification occurs only at the level of each
Indicator, without producing an overall ranking, thereby allowing users to
focus on the Indicators that are most relevant to their
preferences.
