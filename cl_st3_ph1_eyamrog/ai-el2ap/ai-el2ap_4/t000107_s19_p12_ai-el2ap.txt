Figure 8 indicates that, in contrast to the initial findings
presented in Figure 7, the four theses catalogued in Domínio
Público were also catalogued in both the BDTD and the
Catálogo de Teses e Dissertações da CAPES databases. Furthermore, the
data demonstrate that the Catálogo de Teses e Dissertações da
CAPES is the most comprehensive source, as it includes all
theses and dissertations identified in both the Domínio Público and
BDTD databases. Table 4 provides the titles of all theses
and dissertations located, along with the corresponding websites from which
they can be accessed.
