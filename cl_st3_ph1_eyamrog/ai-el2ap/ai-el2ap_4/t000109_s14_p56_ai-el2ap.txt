To evaluate the model against behavioral patterns observed in Argentine
cities, a simulation was conducted using empirical data from the
district of Loncopué, Neuquén province. This implementation incorporated both local
behavioral characteristics and a phase change in PMSI. The reported
daily case data for Loncopué were found to be consistent
with the model outputs, supporting the use of these data
as an indicator of AbCSim validity. The corresponding values are
presented in Table 1.
