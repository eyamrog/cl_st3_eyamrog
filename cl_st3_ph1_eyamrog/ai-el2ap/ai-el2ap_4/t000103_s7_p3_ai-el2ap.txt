Data were collected from Portuguese and Brazilian participants who are
studying English or Spanish at universities in Brazil or Portugal,
and these data were compared to those obtained from native
speakers of the respective languages. All participants voluntarily completed an
online questionnaire designed to assess their proficiency in the second
language (L2) and to evaluate their ability to identify the
subject in ambiguous sentences presented in both their first language
(L1) and L2.
