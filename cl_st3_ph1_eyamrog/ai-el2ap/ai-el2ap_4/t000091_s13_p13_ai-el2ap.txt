Valerenic acid has been shown to interact with the GABAergic
system, a mechanism of action similar to that of benzodiazepine
drugs. In a study conducted in rats, the effects of
Valeriana officinalis extract and valerenic acid were compared with those
of diazepam, and the chemical composition of the extract was
analyzed. The findings indicated a significant reduction in anxiety-related behaviors
in animals treated with the valerian extract and valerenic acid,
supporting the potential of Valeriana officinalis as an alternative to
conventional anxiolytic agents (Murphy et al., 2010). Additionally, a more
recent study demonstrated that daily administration of 0.5 mg/kg valerenic
acid for three weeks reduced both physical and psychological stress
responses in rats exposed to stressors (Jung et al., 2015).
