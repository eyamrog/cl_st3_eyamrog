In Ireland, approximately 90% of primary and secondary schools are
denominational, whereas in England, denominational education is primarily limited to
voluntary-aided schools, independent schools, and faith academies, collectively serving about
one third of students. Independent schools constitute only 1% of
all schools in England and enroll approximately 7% of pupils,
while faith-maintained schools provide religious education to around 25% of
students. The remaining two thirds of English pupils attend maintained
schools without a religious character; however, these schools still offer
religious education classes, the content of which is determined by
the respective Local Education Authority (LEA).
