Figure 2 presents the symptoms reported by both vaccinated and
unvaccinated adolescents. The mean number of symptoms was six in
both groups. Vaccinated adolescents reported a runny nose more frequently
than unvaccinated adolescents (87.5% vs. 48.5%, p=0.046). In contrast, unvaccinated
adolescents reported fatigue more frequently than their vaccinated counterparts (90.9%
vs. 62.5%, p=0.04). Other reported symptoms, including anosmia, were observed
in both groups at similar rates (75.0% in vaccinated and
72.7% in unvaccinated individuals).
