Agent-based models (ABM) are computational modeling and simulation techniques employed
to analyze the organization and dynamics of complex systems. These
models comprise an artificial society composed of autonomous and heterogeneous
agents that interact with each other and with their environment
in non-trivial ways, following predefined rules that establish a specific
social architecture. The social dimension of ABM arises from the
heterogeneity, autonomy, interdependence, and social embedding of the computational agents
[20]. To date, relatively few models with these characteristics have
been applied to the study of COVID-19 [10][11][21][22][23]. Moreover, most
existing models have been developed for specific contexts within particular
regions or countries, making it challenging to generalize or adapt
them to new situations without substantial scientific and technical expertise.
