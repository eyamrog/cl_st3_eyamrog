A detailed examination of the definitions of the Indicators reveals
that they are highly objective, featuring clear definitions and quantitative
measures governed by pre-defined rules (https://www.umultirank.org/export/sites/default/press-media/documents/Indicator-Book-2020.pdf). Unlike rankings that incorporate
“reputation” metrics—where members of the international academic and industrial communities
evaluate institutions based on subjective experience and personal opinion rather
than empirical data—this ranking system relies exclusively on measurable criteria.
This approach represents a significant distinction from more traditional, one-dimensional
rankings. For instance, the Times Higher Education World University Rankings
(https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings) assigns a 33% weight to reputation-based indicators in its
final assessment, while the QS World University Rankings (https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings) allocates
up to 50%. This reliance on objective data is a
notable strength of U-Multirank. However, it should be noted that
61.11% of the data used in U-Multirank is self-reported by
institutions, and many institutions do not yet provide data with
sufficient accuracy or completeness. This limitation indicates an area where
further improvement is necessary.
