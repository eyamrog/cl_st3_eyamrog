The administration of oral tranquilizing drugs represents an alternative method
for achieving conscious sedation. Premedication is used to manage stress
induced by dental procedures, thereby promoting patient calmness and cooperation
(Loeffler, 1992). Oral benzodiazepines are commonly employed in dentistry for
this purpose, as they are effective in reducing basal metabolic
rate, salivary flow, and the vomiting reflex, as well as
inducing relaxation of skeletal muscles (Pinheiro et al., 2014).
