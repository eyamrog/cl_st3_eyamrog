The analysis began with an examination of the macro context,
taking into account the social demands outlined in the objectives
and postulates of territorial planning documents, including the National Development
Plan. Additionally, studies assessing the demand and relevance of the

proficient in the most current and in-demand ICT skills. Consideration
was also given to the study modalities most appropriate for
the target population, while ensuring that historical, social, cultural, and
technological factors relevant to the context were not overlooked.
