The rates of O2 consumption and CO2 release in NS
and seeds progressively declined after reaching their respective peaks at
7 and 14 days, ultimately converging to similar values by
35 days (Figure 3). This reduction in respiration rate may
be attributed to an increase in photosynthetic activity associated with
leaf and multiple shoot development in seeds and NS, respectively,
as well as to the depletion of the carbon source
in the culture medium. In vitro plants grown under photomixotrophic
conditions, as in the present study, exhibit photosynthetic activity, although
at lower rates compared to respiration (Ševčíková et al. 2019).
Previous research has shown that protocorm-like bodies of Cymbidium Melody
Fair 'Marilyn Monroe' orchids displayed increased photosynthetic rates accompanied by
decreased respiration between 20 and 60 days of in vitro
culture in MS medium containing 2% sucrose (Ogasawara et al.
1995). Additional studies suggest that enhanced photosynthesis can elevate cytosolic
ATP/ADP ratios, thereby inhibiting respiration (Krömer 1995; Buchanan et al.
2015). The observed decrease in O2 consumption may also reflect
reduced cellular energy demand following seedling establishment and completion of
morphogenesis in NS plants, both of which are energy-intensive processes
(Yaseen et al. 2012; Taiz et al. 2017). Furthermore, the
presence of photosynthetic capacity in seed and NS plants by
35 days may facilitate ex vitro acclimatization at this stage
(Ševčíková et al. 2019). Consistent with this, our research group
observed a 100% survival rate after transplanting one-month-old A. strobilacea
seedlings (De Carvalho et al. 2014) and NS plants (unpublished
data) to Pinus bark substrate under the same environmental conditions.
