As shown in Table 2, there are very few instances
of affection between the fathers in Me, Daddy & Dad
(2017). The data indicate that physical contact occurs more frequently
between Daddy and the child than between the two fathers.
This suggests that one father demonstrates more affection than the
other. The analysis further reveals that limited contact between the
fathers corresponds with the infrequent occasions on which they are
depicted together in the illustrations.
