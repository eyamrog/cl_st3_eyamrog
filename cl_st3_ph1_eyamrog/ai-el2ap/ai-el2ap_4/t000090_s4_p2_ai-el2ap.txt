Occasionally, U-Multirank compiles a list of "best performers" by country
for a given year, a process that presents challenges due
to the multidimensional nature of the rankings. This study demonstrated
that multiple approaches can be employed to create such an
overall classification. U-Multirank currently utilizes an "Olympic Medals Table" format,
identifying top institutions as those with the highest number of
maximum scores. The present paper identified several issues associated with
this method and proposed two alternative approaches for generating a
general ranking: calculating the simple average of all indicators and
calculating the average of the dimensions. The latter was considered
preferable in this study, as it incorporates all available data
and assigns equal weight to each dimension. This consideration is
particularly relevant, as some form of overall classification will be
necessary if multidimensional evaluation is adopted by Capes.
