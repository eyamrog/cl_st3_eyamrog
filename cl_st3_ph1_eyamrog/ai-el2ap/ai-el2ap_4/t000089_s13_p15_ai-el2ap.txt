The liberal argument that privileging Christianity in Religious Education (RE)
syllabuses and in school life contravenes principles of liberal equality
by marginalizing minority worldviews and perpetuating structures of dominance warrants
careful consideration. This objection is valid insofar as reflective thinking
benefits from exposure to a plurality of social values and
public norms. However, in the context of education, it is
important to recognize the experiential aspect of knowledge acquisition, which,
according to pragmatist philosophies, is closely linked to the intellectual
traditions and cultural perspectives that emerge from participation in social
activities. As noted by John Dewey and Richard Rorty, engagement
in collective social practices is essential to the learning process,
as it is through such experiences that individuals develop the
capacity to ascribe meaning to the subjects they study.
