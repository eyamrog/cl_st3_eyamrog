According to Halliday (1978, p. 27), language is conceptualized as
"meaning potential," as the communicative context influences the choices made
by speakers. As a result, text and context are interdependent,
and language is regarded as a form of social semiotics
(Halliday, 1978). In this framework, semiotic resources are defined as
"systems of meanings" that collectively constitute the "reality" of a
given culture (Halliday, 1978, p. 123).
