The data were analyzed using IBM® SPSS® Statistics, version 23.
The normality of the distribution of continuous variables was assessed
with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Quantitative variables with a parametric distribution
were summarized using means and standard deviations, while non-parametric quantitative
variables were described using medians and ranges. Qualitative variables were
reported as percentages.
