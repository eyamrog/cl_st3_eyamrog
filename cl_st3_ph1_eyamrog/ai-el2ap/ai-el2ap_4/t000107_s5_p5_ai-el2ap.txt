Of the 14 works retrieved from the aforementioned websites, only
one was not available in digital format for consultation (A
Tradução de Resumos/Abstracts de Dissertações e de Teses da Área
Médica, Patrícia Dias Reis, 2002). In the remaining 13 studies,
all authors employed corpus linguistics methodologies in various ways to
conduct their research, underscoring the significance of this approach in
the translation of specialized language texts, specifically in the context
of medical translation. With respect to the type of corpus
utilized, four studies employed comparable corpora to: (1) identify and
verify patterns in expressions commonly used in the development and
textual organization of scientific articles, (2) analyze the use of
the word "submit," (3) investigate specialized collocations in cardiology texts,
and (4) analyze lexical bundles within the health sciences, including
medicine, nutrition, and pharmacy. Five studies used parallel corpora to:
(1) develop a Portuguese-English glossary in cardiology, (2) analyze the
occurrence of compounds (Komposita) in German, (3) examine the retextualization
of abstracts in the biomedical field, (4) investigate textual markers
that indicate translation difficulties arising from intercultural issues, and (5)
identify candidate terms in the biomedical field. Two studies utilized
both parallel and comparable corpora for glossary production. The remaining
two studies, a dissertation and a thesis, did not specify
the type of corpus used in their abstracts, which constitutes
a significant omission. The dissertation analyzed anatomical language using a
corpus, while the thesis focused on producing a collocation glossary
for texts on arterial hypertension.
