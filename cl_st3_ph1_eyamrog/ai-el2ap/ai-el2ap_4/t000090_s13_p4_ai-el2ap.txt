As previously noted, U-Multirank was not intended to provide an
overall classification of educational institutions. Instead, it offers classifications based
solely on specific performance indicators, which are organized into distinct
dimensions. Consequently, this ranking system presents institutional performance profiles that
highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each institution within each
indicator and dimension. Based on this structure, users are able
to create personalized rankings by selecting the dimensions and indicators
they consider most relevant to their needs. Additionally, a common
rationale for the adoption of a multidimensional approach is that
one-dimensional rankings lack robustness, as minor adjustments to the weighting
of indicators can lead to substantial changes in results, thereby
significantly undermining the validity of such rankings.
