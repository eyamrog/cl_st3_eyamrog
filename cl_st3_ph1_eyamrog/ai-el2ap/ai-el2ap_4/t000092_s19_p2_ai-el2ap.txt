The variables analyzed in the frequency domain were as follows:
low frequency (LF) with a median value of 135.8 ms²
(range: 13.7–2861.7 ms²), high frequency (HF) with a median value
of 89.04 ms² (range: 4.14–5234.4 ms²), normalized low frequency (LFnu)
with a mean of 57.57 ± 22.39, and normalized high
frequency (HFnu) with a mean of 43.18 ± 22.64. The
LF/HF ratio had a mean value of 2.1 ± 2.09
ms². Additionally, 41.2% (n = 28) of the patients exhibited
a high LF/HF ratio (> 2).
