This book concludes in the same manner in which it
begins, featuring text centrally positioned on the page and depicted
as written on the wall. The accompanying illustration presents Emilyâ€™s
room with her pens and pencils scattered on the floor,
mirroring the arrangement shown on page 26. Consistent with the
first page, there is an explicit reference to Dad, Daddy,
and Max, listed in the same sequence.
