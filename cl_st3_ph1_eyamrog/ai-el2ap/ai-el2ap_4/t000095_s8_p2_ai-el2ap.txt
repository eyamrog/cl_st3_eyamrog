Although the proportion of elderly individuals is higher in Rio
de Janeiro than in São Paulo (18.9% and 13.3%, respectively),
age-standardized mortality rates suggest that factors other than age contribute
to the observed differences in risk of death, with rates
of 195 per 100,000 inhabitants in Rio de Janeiro compared
to 125 per 100,000 in the city of São Paulo.
