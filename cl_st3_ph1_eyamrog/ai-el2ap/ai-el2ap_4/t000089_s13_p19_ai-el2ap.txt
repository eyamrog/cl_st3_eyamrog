The assertion that Religious Education (RE) syllabuses, according to the
neutralist liberal perspective, should prioritize breadth over depth by covering
as many religions as possible, fails to account for the
experiential dimension of cognitive knowledge. As Ninian Smart (1968, pp.
93â€“94) has argued, similar to the study of philosophy or
the sciences, a comprehensive understanding of the development of various
religious belief systems requires active engagement with their content, rather
than passive reception. Smart maintains that a purely expository approach
to philosophical teachings, such as those of Plato, is insufficient
without a dialogical process that involves critical questioning, establishing connections,
and contextual reinterpretation. Likewise, the study of the history of
science should elucidate the specific motivations behind the emergence of
new methodologies and conceptual frameworks that address and improve upon
previous paradigms. Therefore, RE is likely to be more effective
when it encourages an engaged approach, enabling students to relate
religious content to their own experiences, activities, and aspirations. It
is important to recognize that disciplines such as philosophy and
science, even when taught through historical surveys, inherently link cultural
experiences with scientific knowledge, as their syllabuses are shaped by
particular narratives situated within specific socio-historical contexts. For example, philosophy
curricula in Western societies often emphasize figures such as Plato,
Kant, or Mill, rather than Eastern traditions like Confucianism or
Daoism, largely due to the former's greater influence on the
social and political development of those societies. This emphasis does
not necessitate a static view of knowledge, as increasing pluralism
in Western societies may prompt educators to incorporate greater attention
to Eastern philosophies. However, fostering understanding of unfamiliar cultural and
intellectual traditions requires practical engagement with the activities, attitudes, and
lifestyles that underpin those philosophies. Comparative analysis, such as examining
Western concepts of individual freedom alongside Eastern perspectives on collective
life and their respective implications for rights and justice, can
be particularly instructive. This approach is especially relevant in contexts
such as intergenerational conflicts over marital choices among families of
Asian heritage. Ultimately, drawing on the diverse experiences of students
can enhance the effectiveness of mutual learning within RE.
