The in-depth instruction of a particular faith should be considered
the responsibility of parents who desire it, rather than a
function of state education. The state should neither promote nor
challenge the validity of religious or political beliefs. Consequently, it
is recommended that religious education be replaced with a new
curriculum that enables students to engage with moral and ethical
issues from an objective and religiously neutral perspective (National Secular
Society, 2013: 9).
