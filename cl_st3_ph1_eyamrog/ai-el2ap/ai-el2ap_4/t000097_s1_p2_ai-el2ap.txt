Methods: In accordance with the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews
(PRISMA-ScR) guidelines, a systematic search was conducted across five databases:
Cochrane Library, PubMed Central®, ScienceDirect, Scopus Elsevier, and Web of
Science. No restrictions were applied regarding language or year of
publication. Two researchers independently and blindly screened the identified studies,
both manually and using Rayyan software. The search strategy utilized
the following keywords: ‘breast cancer’ AND ‘physical activity’ OR ‘physical
exercise’ AND ‘protocol study’ OR ‘study protocol’. Studies were included
if they were protocols of randomized clinical trials involving physical
activity and/or physical exercise interventions in women undergoing breast cancer
treatment or in the post-treatment phase.
