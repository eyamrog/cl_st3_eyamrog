The literature on policy dismantling emerged prior to the rise
of illiberal populism as a significant phenomenon in global politics.
The foundational work by Michael Bauer, Andrew Jordan, Christoffer Green-Pedersen,
and Adrienne Héritier, published in 2012, is rooted in analyses
of social policy dismantling processes that began before the 2008
financial crisis and were subsequently intensified by it. This body
of research builds on Paul Pierson’s conceptualization of dismantling, first
articulated in the 1990s (Bauer et al., 2012). At that
time, policy dismantling primarily referred to the elimination or reduction
of policy instruments, typically in response to fiscal constraints. Pierson’s
original contributions specifically addressed the dismantling of the welfare state.
