This study presents a bibliometric mapping of research on medical
translation in Brazil, with the primary objective of identifying and
analyzing master’s, doctoral, and post-doctoral studies conducted between 2002 and
2018. The analysis focuses on the topics addressed, the institutions
involved, and the geographic distribution of the research. The significance
of this study lies in its ability to highlight both
the regions and institutions where research on medical translation is
concentrated, as well as those where such studies are limited
or absent. This mapping provides a reference for researchers interested
in the field and may inform the development of public
policies aimed at promoting research in medical translation. Data were
collected from three digital platforms—Domínio Público, Biblioteca Digital de Teses
e Dissertações, and Catálogo de Teses e Dissertações da CAPES—using
various Portuguese-language keywords in the respective search interfaces. Of the
14 studies identified, 28.6% were doctoral dissertations and 71.4% were
master’s theses, all of which were conducted in the southeastern
and southern regions of Brazil. The most frequently addressed topics
were cardiology and general biomedicine, followed by anesthesiology, orthopedics, cardiovascular
surgery, arterial hypertension, physiology, geriatrics, gerontology, nutrition, and pharmacy.
