As shown in Table 2, the results for European Portuguese
(EP) and Brazilian Portuguese (BP) speakers are highly similar; however,
in cases of zero anaphora, BP speakers are more likely
to associate the ellipsis with the subject than EP speakers
(90% and 75%, respectively). Both groups predominantly employ the Position
of Antecedent Strategy. Nevertheless, this strategy appears to be less
robust in cases of pronominal cataphora compared to pronominal anaphora.
The alternative "other" was selected only when the anaphor was
a pronoun, and it was chosen more frequently in cataphoric
contexts than in anaphoric ones. These findings suggest that pronominal
cataphora presents greater processing difficulty than other types of anaphora.
