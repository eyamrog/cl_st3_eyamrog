This paper presents a multimodal analysis of the main characteristics
of the compositional metafunction in the picturebook Me, Daddy &
Dad (2017), which features a two-father family. The aim of
the analysis is to examine how textual meanings are constructed.
The study employs the principal tools of the grammar of
visual design as applied to picturebooks, following the framework established
by Painter et al. (2013). Key concepts from this grammar
are demonstrated through descriptions of selected images from the picturebook,
with particular attention to the interaction between written text and
visual elements, the types of written and visual themes, layout,
framing, and focus. The findings indicate that both fathers are
depicted as actively involved in childcare and domestic activities, such
as cooking, thereby presenting two-father families in an egalitarian manner.
However, the analysis also reveals a lack of explicit expressions
of affection among the characters; although Daddy and Dad are
occasionally shown together, there is minimal physical contact either between
the fathers themselves or between the fathers and the child.
