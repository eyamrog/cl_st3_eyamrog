A total of 388,657 records from Rio de Janeiro and
São Paulo (91,532 and 297,125, respectively) were included in the
analyses. The SIVEP-GRIPE Surveillance System collects a range of variables
beyond diagnostic information. However, while age data were complete and
sex data had minimal missing values, other variables such as
race, years of education, and comorbidities exhibited high rates of
non-response. Data quality also varied substantially across different settings. For
example, missing information on race was 13% in public healthcare
services in the interior of São Paulo, compared to 54%
in private sector records from the capital of Rio de
Janeiro. Across all settings, race data were consistently less complete
in private services than in public ones. Regarding educational attainment,
the proportion of missing data approached 80% in most comparisons,
except for public and private services in the interior of
São Paulo, where missingness, although still considerable, was approximately 50%
(Table 1).
