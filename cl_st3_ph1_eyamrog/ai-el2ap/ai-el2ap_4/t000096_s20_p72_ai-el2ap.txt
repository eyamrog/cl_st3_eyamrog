This study examines the potential for integrating information and communication
technologies (ICT) to support entrepreneurship and foster educational innovation projects.
The analysis focuses on identifying the ways in which ICT
can enhance the development, implementation, and scalability of entrepreneurial initiatives
within educational contexts. Key factors considered include the accessibility of
digital tools, the facilitation of collaborative learning environments, and the
capacity for ICT to enable new pedagogical approaches. The findings
suggest that the effective integration of ICT can contribute to
the creation of more dynamic and innovative educational projects, thereby
promoting entrepreneurial skills and mindsets among learners.
