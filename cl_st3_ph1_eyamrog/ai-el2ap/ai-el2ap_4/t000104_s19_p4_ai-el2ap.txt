A total of 21 taxonomic groups were identified across the
three sampling sites (Table 3), with identification conducted to the
order and family levels. According to Beghelli et al. (2012),
species-level identification of benthic macroinvertebrates requires the collection and analysis
of nymph, pupa, and larval stages, which was not feasible
in this study. Furthermore, Silveira (2004) demonstrated that effective biomonitoring
of microbenthic communities can be achieved when organisms are identified
to higher taxonomic levels, such as class.
