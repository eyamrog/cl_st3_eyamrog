Although there is an explicit reference to Dad initially, there
is no indication that he is the biological father. The
similarity between Daddy’s hair and Emily’s suggests a biological relationship.
Furthermore, Daddy is typically depicted as being closer to Emily
and assuming a protective role, as evidenced by the cover
of the picturebook (see Figure 1).
