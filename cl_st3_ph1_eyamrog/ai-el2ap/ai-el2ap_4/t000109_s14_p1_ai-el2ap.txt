Repast [29] is an open-source platform that provides a suite
of agent-based modeling and simulation tools compatible with multiple operating
systems. For each experiment or scenario tested, a computer cluster
is utilized to execute multiple instances of the model concurrently,
enabling the generation of results that reflect central tendencies due
to the stochastic nature of the studied phenomenon. The platform
supports the implementation of agent characteristics, behaviors, and interactions both
among agents and with their environments. Figure 1 presents the
overall structure of the model, illustrating various levels of detail.
The highest level depicts the complete model (black block), including
its initial conditions, inputs, and outputs. The second level details
the primary system components (blue blocks): one block simulates virus
spread within individual hosts (left side), and another simulates disease
transmission between hosts (right side), following the approach of previous
studies [30]. The subsequent level (green blocks) specifies submodels for
epidemiological characterization and infectivity for each agent, along with their
associated parameters. It also includes submodels for interpersonal contact, location,
and mobility/activity, as well as the relevant parameters for these
submodels. Additionally, this level displays the transport and infectious trail
submodels (magenta blocks). Each submodel will be described in detail
in the following sections.
