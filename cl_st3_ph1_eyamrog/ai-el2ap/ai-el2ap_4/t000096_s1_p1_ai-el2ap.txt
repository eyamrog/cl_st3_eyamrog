The current context in the field of education requires teachers
who are able to operate effectively in emerging learning environments,
where the potential of information and communication technologies (ICT) for
information acquisition and communication is substantial. Consequently, there is a
need for postgraduate programs that support the development of digital
competencies among teachers. The primary objective of this study is
to propose a curricular design for a Master's program in
Education with a specialization in the Management of ICT-Mediated Learning,
to be offered by the Universidad Nacional de Chimborazo in
Ecuador. To achieve this, a qualitative research approach was employed
to identify and define the key characteristics of each curriculum
module. A documentary research design was implemented using the PICOC
method (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, Context). The outcome of this
study is a curriculum framework comprising 12 modules, which address
topics such as digital literacy for contemporary society, didactics in
digital environments, the design and development of digital learning content
and resources, innovative approaches to learning and educational innovation, and
research in educational technology.
