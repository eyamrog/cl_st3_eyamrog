Several notable observations regarding the correlations among the indicators can
be made. The indicator "External Research Income" does not exhibit
a strong or very strong correlation with any other indicator,
suggesting that external research funding is generally not associated with
increased outputs such as publications, citations, or art-related products. Similarly,
the number of "Post-doctoral" positions does not demonstrate a significant
correlation with these types of academic or creative outputs.
