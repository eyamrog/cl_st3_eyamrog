A general Education about Religions and Beliefs and Ethics programme
may be applicable even within denominational schools; however, the NCCA’s
proposal for a specific subject or cross-curricular area that aims
to present religious content “without promoting one faith perspective above
another” raises questions regarding its foundational philosophy. It is necessary
to consider whether the programme is intended to promote a
neutralist or postmodern conception of religion, which assumes a shared
framework of political principles in the public sphere while adopting
a relativistic epistemology in the private sphere, or whether it
genuinely facilitates cross-cultural learning by encouraging pupils to understand perspectives
different from their own. If the former is the case,
the Catholic Church’s concerns about the incompatibility of such a
programme with its belief system and educational objectives are justified,
and the proposal may not foster a dialogical approach to
the pursuit of truth, as previously discussed. If the latter
is the case, it is important to recognize that genuine
reflectivity is achieved through substantive criticism, wherein the inconsistencies and
limitations of a given tradition can be addressed through the
acquisition of new conceptual knowledge, which, following evaluative processes, may
enable social groups to develop a unified ethical framework.
