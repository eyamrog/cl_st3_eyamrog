Table 4 indicates that there are no strong or very
strong correlations among the Indicators, and only one moderate correlation
is observed, specifically a positive correlation between “Graduating on time
(bachelors)” and “Graduating on time (masters)”. This suggests that institutions
with higher rates of on-time graduation at the bachelor’s level
also tend to have higher rates at the master’s level,
with a moderate degree of association. All other correlations among
the Indicators are weak, indicating that the four Indicators within
the “Teaching and Learning” Dimension exhibit a substantial degree of
independence from one another. This independence suggests that these Indicators
are appropriate for measuring the Dimension. The average magnitude of
the correlations among all Indicators in this Dimension is 0.2005,
with a standard deviation of 0.2443, representing the lowest average
among all Dimensions analyzed. These findings support the validity of
this Dimension for the group of institutions examined in this
study.
