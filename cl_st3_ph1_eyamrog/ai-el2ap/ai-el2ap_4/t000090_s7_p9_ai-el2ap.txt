After compiling the list of institutions, the correlations among all
pairs of indicators within the same dimension were calculated and
analyzed. Similarly, correlations among the average values of each dimension
were also computed. The purpose of these analyses is to
assess the degree of association among the dimensions and indicators,
thereby evaluating their level of independence. High correlations are anticipated
for certain indicators; for example, the absolute number of publications,
the normalized number of publications, and the number of “top
cited” publications are likely to be strongly correlated, as institutions
with high values in one of these indicators are expected
to have high values in the others. Examining these correlations
is important because it provides insight into whether the study
is genuinely measuring five distinct dimensions and thirty-six separate indicators,
or if some indicators and dimensions are essentially alternative measures
of the same underlying construct.
