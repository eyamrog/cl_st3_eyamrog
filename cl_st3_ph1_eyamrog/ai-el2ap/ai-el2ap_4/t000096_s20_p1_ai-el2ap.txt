It is essential that the curricular proposal aligns with both
governmental educational policies and those of the proposing institution. Accordingly,
at the macro-curricular level, the Master's Program in Education with
a specialization in Management of ICT-mediated Learning is designed to
be consistent with the educational and pedagogical model of the
Universidad Nacional de Chimborazo, known as the Epistemological-methodological approach. This
approach emphasizes complexity and aims for the integral development of
individuals by integrating research, training, and community engagement (UNACH 2014).
Furthermore, this pedagogical model is aligned with the policies outlined
in the National Development Plan of the National Government (SENPLADES
2017), thereby facilitating the application of complex thinking to address
contemporary socio-educational challenges.
