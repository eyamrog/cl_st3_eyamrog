When President Rousseff was impeached in 2016 and succeeded by
Vice-President Michel Temer, there were widespread reports within the federal
bureaucracy of intentions to resist policy dismantling. Some bureaucrats did
engage in such resistance, potentially facilitated by a broader political
context that constrained Temer's ability to implement significant changes. Assuming
the presidency under contested circumstances, Temer concentrated his 2.5-year tenure
on two primary objectives: labor reform, which he achieved, and
pension reform, which he did not. Other policy areas were
not central to Temer's agenda or to the interests of
the economic groups that supported his rise to office, allowing
the bureaucracy in certain sectors to maintain continuity in policy
implementation. For example, in the area of human rights, Temer
appointed Flavia Piovesan, a highly respected scholar, who was able
to elevate the institutional status of the department of LGBTQ
rights within the Ministry of Human Rights. In foreign policy,
Temer maintained the positions of his predecessor, pursued accession to
the OECD, and preserved previous levels of South-South cooperation projects
(Marcondes & Mawdsley, 2017), a phenomenon that can be attributed
to what has been termed ‘bureaucratic momentum’ (Morais de Sa
e Silva, forthcoming).
