For each Ha, a method is implemented to detect the
presence of another agent within a 2-meter range [39][40][41]. If
this proximity is maintained for 15 minutes or longer and
at least one of the agents is infected (either symptomatic
or asymptomatic), the epidemiological state attribute of the uninfected Ha
transitions to exposed (E) with a probability of 𝑣(𝑇𝑒𝑚𝑝) ∗
𝛽.
