In our previous studies (Bruscato & Baptista, 2022a, 2022b), the
sample consisted of only five native Spanish speakers, all of
whom were learners of Portuguese, and the participants generally adhered
to the PAS, except in cases involving pronominal cataphora. With
the current study, which includes twice as many participants who
are not learners of Portuguese, the data indicate that exceptions
to PAS occur not only with pronominal cataphora but also
with pronominal anaphora. Specifically, while native Spanish speakers are more
likely to interpret ellipsis in the subject position of the
subordinate clause as referring to the subject of the main
clause than when the anaphor is a pronoun, they do
not tend to interpret an unstressed pronoun in the subject
position of the subordinate clause as referring to the complement
of the main clause. These findings are consistent with the
results reported by Alonso-Ovalle et al. (2002) and Keating et
al. (2011).
