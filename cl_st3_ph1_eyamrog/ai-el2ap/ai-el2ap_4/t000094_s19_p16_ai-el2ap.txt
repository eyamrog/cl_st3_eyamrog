The analysis of the pages where Emily appears with her
two fathers indicates that Daddy and Dad occupy distinct spatial
positions within the illustrations. Dad is positioned on the right
on page 7, while both fathers are depicted surrounding Emily
on pages 8, 14, and 27. They are shown in
the center and on the left on page 19, and
in the background with Daddy on the right, connected to
Emily by vectors, on pages 23 and 28. When Emily
is depicted with Daddy alone, she is positioned on the
right on page 11 and on the left on page
20. Dad is the first to be mentioned in the
written text on page 6, which states, “This is my
Dad, and my Daddy,” and he occupies a prominent position
on the right—the conventional location for new information—when he first
appears visually on page 7. Additionally, Dad is shown performing
actions such as drawing on page 8 and cooking on
page 12, suggesting that he is depicted as more active
than Daddy.
