Similar to the situation in Ireland, Humanist UK (formerly the
British Humanist Association) advocates for Religious Education (RE) to be
“an inclusive, impartial, objective, fair, balanced and relevant subject allowing
pupils to explore a variety of religions and non-religious worldviews”
(Humanist UK, 2017). Although the organisation welcomed the Qualifications and
Curriculum Authority’s publication of a non-statutory National Framework for Religious
Education (NFRE) in 2014, its leadership has expressed concerns regarding
the representation of Humanism within RE syllabuses as outlined in
the framework. Specifically, while the NFRE recommends the study of
Christianity across all key stages, it applies a demographic rationale
to the inclusion of other religious and secular ethical systems.
According to the NFRE, Humanism should be included in the
RE syllabus only “where appropriate,” with the decision left to
the discretion of each Local Education Authority (LEA). In response
to what they describe as the “NFRE’s deliberately light touch
approach,” Humanist UK has advocated for equal treatment of Humanism
and other religions, arguing that such parity can only be
achieved through the centralisation of the RE syllabus in accordance
with a National Framework (Watson, 2007, p. 2).
