This study distinguishes the specific characteristics of traditional learning assessment
from those of electronic assessment (e-assessment), highlighting differences in administration,
feedback mechanisms, and accessibility. Traditional assessment typically involves paper-based tests
conducted in controlled environments, with feedback often provided after a
delay. In contrast, e-assessment utilizes digital platforms, enabling immediate feedback,
flexible scheduling, and the integration of multimedia resources. To enhance
the design and implementation of e-assessment, this study proposes strategies
such as aligning assessment tasks with learning objectives, ensuring accessibility
for diverse learners, and incorporating automated grading tools. Additionally, the
use of secure online platforms, question banks, and analytics for
monitoring student performance are recommended as effective resources to support
robust and equitable e-assessment practices.
