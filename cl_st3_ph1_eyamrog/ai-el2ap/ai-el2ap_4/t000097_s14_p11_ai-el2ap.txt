The Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool was employed to assess the methodological
quality of the included studies. The evaluation focused on the
following criteria: (1) random sequence generation, (2) allocation concealment, (3)
blinding of participants and researchers, and (4) selective reporting. Criteria
related to blinding of outcome assessment and incomplete outcome data
were not considered, as study protocols do not report intervention
results. The reviewers (JS, ACAG) independently rated each domain as
having a low, unclear, or high risk of bias.
