In England, all state-funded schools—including voluntary aided, voluntary controlled, and
academies (which are free schools receiving state funding through specific
contractual arrangements with the government)—are required to implement the National
Curriculum. The Education Act 2002 stipulates that the curriculum, in
its overall approach, is designed to promote the spiritual, moral,
cultural, mental, and physical development of pupils both within the
school and in society, and to prepare pupils for the
opportunities, responsibilities, and experiences they will encounter in later life.
