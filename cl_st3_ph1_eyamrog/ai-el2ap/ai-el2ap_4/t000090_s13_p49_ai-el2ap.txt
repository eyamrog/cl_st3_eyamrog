There are also four moderate correlations, as shown in Table
6. The mean magnitude of all the indicators within this
dimension is 0.2722, with a standard deviation of 0.1985. These
results indicate that this dimension comprises a robust set of
indicators, with only one instance of redundancy among the seven
indicators analyzed in the group of institutions considered in this
study.
