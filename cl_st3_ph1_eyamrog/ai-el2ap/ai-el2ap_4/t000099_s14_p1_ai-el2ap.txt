Seeds of Acanthostachys strobilacea (Schult. & Schult.f.) Klotzsch were collected
from the Reserva Biológica de Mogi Guaçu, São Paulo State,
Brazil, and stored at 8°C for approximately 12 months prior
to experimentation. Nodal segments (NS) were obtained following the protocol
described by Santos et al. (2010). Seeds were surface-sterilized using
100% (v/v) commercial sodium hypochlorite (2% active chlorine) with 0.1%
(v/v) Tween 20® for 20 minutes, followed by immersion in
25% (v/v) hydrochloric acid for 10 minutes to remove most
of the mucilage. Subsequently, seeds were treated with 70% (v/v)
ethanol for 5 minutes, 0.1% (w/v) Benomyl fungicide for 15
minutes, and again with 100% (v/v) commercial sodium hypochlorite containing
0.1% (v/v) Tween 20® for 1 hour, as described by
Santos et al. (2010). The sterilized seeds were aseptically transferred
to 250 mL flasks containing 40 mL of Murashige &
Skoog (1962) medium (MS) with one-fifth of the original macronutrient
concentration (MS/5), full-strength MS micronutrients, 2% (w/v) sucrose, 100 mg
L⁻¹ myo-inositol, and 0.1 mg L⁻¹ thiamine. The medium pH
was adjusted to 5.8, and 5 g L⁻¹ agar was
added prior to autoclaving at 121°C for 15 minutes. Seeds
were incubated in a growth room at 25±2°C with a
12-hour photoperiod and a light intensity of 14 μmol m⁻²
s⁻¹ to promote stem axis elongation (Santos et al. 2010).
After three months, NS were isolated from the elongated plants
(Figure 1a) and aseptically transferred to flasks containing 20 mL
of the same culture medium, sealed with caps featuring a
2-mm hole covered by a rubber septum to facilitate air
sample collection (Lamarca & Barbedo 2012). The same procedure was
applied to a batch of surface-sterilized seeds. Flasks were maintained
in a growth room under a 12-hour photoperiod, at 25±2°C,
and an irradiance of 30 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹. Plant growth
and air samples were analyzed during the light period at
0, 7, 14, 21, and 35 days using five flasks,
each containing five propagules.
