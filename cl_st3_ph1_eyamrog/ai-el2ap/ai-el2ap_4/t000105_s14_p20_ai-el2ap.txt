All national protocol recommendations for the prevention of novel coronavirus
transmission were implemented, including frequent hand washing, the use of
personal protective equipment (apron, cap, disposable surgical mask, and goggles)
with changes at every shift, and the preferential engagement of
research participants in peridomestic areas; when this was not feasible,
interactions were conducted in large, well-ventilated rooms [16].
