To identify the types of emojis used to convey social
presence, frequency distributions were calculated for all interactions. The most
frequently used emojis supporting social presence were the Winking Face
(n = 158) and Clapping Hands (n = 153), followed
by Thumbs-Up (n = 74), Face With Tears of Joy
(n = 68), Smiling Face With Smiling Eyes (n =
64), Smiling Face (n = 60), Smiling Face with Hearts
(n = 59), Smiling Face with Heart-Eyes (n = 41),
Slightly Smiling Face (n = 40), Face Blowing a Kiss
(n = 35), Beaming Face with Smiling Eyes (n =
31), and Grinning Face (n = 31) emojis (see Appendix
A). A visualization of the emoji distribution is presented in
