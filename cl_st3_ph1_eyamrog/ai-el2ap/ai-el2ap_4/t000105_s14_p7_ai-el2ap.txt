The sample size was calculated based on the estimated population
of each city, using a 95% confidence level, a design
effect of 1.5, and the parameters specified in Table 1,
which also details the sample distribution by survey stage. To
account for potential losses due to participant refusals, absence of
selected residents, and inaccessible households at the time of the
visit, an additional 20% was added to the sample size
in each city to ensure adequate representation.
