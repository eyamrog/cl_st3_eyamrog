Survey respondents were invited to provide their email addresses if
they consented to participate in a follow-up interview. These interviews
were conducted in the spring of 2021, more than two
years after President Bolsonaro assumed office. The interviews yielded data
that were highly relevant to the research questions addressed in
this study. Several interviewees, especially those currently employed in the
federal government, required multiple assurances regarding the confidentiality of their
identities. Consequently, the research team implemented rigorous measures to remove
identifiable information from all data sources. In some cases, interviewees
shared more detailed perceptions and described ongoing challenges only at
the conclusion of the interview, after the completion of the
structured questions.
