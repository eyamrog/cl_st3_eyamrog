The narrative includes actions occurring both inside the home and
in the countryside, establishing two distinct settings. This duality provides
balance to the story and highlights that children's socialization occurs
in both domestic and outdoor environments. As a result, cultural
patterns and social norms are transmitted to children in both
contexts. Table 2 presents data on the visual representation of
both fathers and the frequency of physical contact between them.
The table indicates that in Me, Daddy & Dad (2017),
physical contact between the two fathers occurs in approximately one
third of their shared appearances, suggesting that displays of affection
are infrequent and generally subtle. Similarly, instances of physical contact
between Emily and her fathers are also limited, as shown
in Table 2.
