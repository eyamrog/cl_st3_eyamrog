Although the pandemic is not yet over, it has persisted
long enough to permit at least preliminary assessments of the
effectiveness of disease control measures and the performance of health
systems. This topic can be examined at various geographical scales
using comparative indicators of both interventions and outcomes. One approach
is to compare global mortality rates associated with the disease;
however, given that morbidity is strongly correlated with age, such
comparisons should include adjustments for differences in the age structures
of the populations being analyzed.
