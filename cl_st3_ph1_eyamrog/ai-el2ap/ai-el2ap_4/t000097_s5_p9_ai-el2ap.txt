A wide variety of instruments were employed across the studies,
which complicates direct comparisons of their findings. For the assessment
of quality of life, identified as the primary outcome in
most study protocols, commonly used instruments included the European Organization
for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire
Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), the EuroQol Five-Dimensional Instrument (EQ-5D-5L), and
the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast (FACT-B). All
of these instruments are validated and widely utilized in research
involving cancer patients. Additionally, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
(HADS) was frequently used to assess symptoms of depression and
anxiety.
