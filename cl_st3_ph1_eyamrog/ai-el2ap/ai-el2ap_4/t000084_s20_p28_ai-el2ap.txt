The findings are consistent with those of Fullwood et al.
(2013), who reported that women are more likely than men
to use emojis. They also align with Alshenqeetiâ€™s (2016) observation
that women tend to be more expressive and emotional in
their communication through emojis compared to men. Furthermore, Alshenqeeti (2016)
emphasizes that emoji use is context-dependent and subject to cultural
variation. In this context, the high frequency of emoji use
observed among Brazilian teachers appears to be influenced by both
cultural and gender-related factors.
