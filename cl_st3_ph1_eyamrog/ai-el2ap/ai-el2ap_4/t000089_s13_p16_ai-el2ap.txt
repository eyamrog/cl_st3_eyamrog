According to Dewey (1929, p. 30), a fundamental aim of
every science is to elucidate the specific processes of inquiry,
actions, and outcomes that have led to particular discoveries. Philosophical
and scientific consensus, therefore, is achieved through the systematic reconstruction
of the historical experiences that have informed individuals’ conclusions about
a given subject. Because these conclusions are based on particular
choices regarding criteria of justification, such reconstruction is essential for
enabling rational agents to assess each other’s findings within a
shared framework of reasons (Dewey, 1929, p. 31). Dewey maintains
that experience is analogous to phenomena such as history, life,
and culture. Building on Dewey’s perspective, Rorty (1999) argues that
intellectual freedom and the pursuit of individual well-being are only
possible after a process of socialization that acquaints individuals with
historical narratives and social practices. Although individuation, understood as the
critical evaluation of social practices, represents the culmination of the
educational process, it is nonetheless dependent on the cultural resources
provided by each linguistic community. Thus, engagement with a tradition
is a prerequisite for the development of social criticism.
