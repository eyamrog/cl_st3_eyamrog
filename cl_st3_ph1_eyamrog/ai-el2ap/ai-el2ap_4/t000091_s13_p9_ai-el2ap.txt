The chemical composition of valerian comprises volatile oil sesquiterpenes, including
valeric acid, as well as iridoids (valepotriates), alkaloids, furanofuran, lignans,
and free amino acids such as tyrosine, arginine, and glutamine.
While sesquiterpene components of the volatile oil are considered primarily
responsible for the majority of valerian's biological effects, evidence suggests
that multiple active constituents may interact synergistically to produce the
overall clinical response (Houghton, 1999).
