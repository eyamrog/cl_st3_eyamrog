The ability to interpret visual elements is essential for analyzing
meaning in picturebooks, as visual components typically occupy the majority
of each page. Visuals support children's comprehension of the written
text by elaborating on or extending the meanings conveyed through
language. The integration of both visual and verbal modes facilitates
children's understanding of the narrative and contributes to their overall
literacy development.
