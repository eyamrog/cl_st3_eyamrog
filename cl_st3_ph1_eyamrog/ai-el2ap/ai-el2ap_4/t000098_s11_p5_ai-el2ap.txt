A comprehensive analysis of the issue discussed in this article
would ideally address all three factors, specifically by adjusting mortality
rates to account for prior prevalence of comorbidities and demographic
differences in sex and age. However, the data available at
the time of writing do not permit such an approach.
Although researchers have, since the onset of the pandemic, urged
governments to systematically collect and release data on cases and
deaths disaggregated by age and sex [DOWD et al., 2020:
9,696], such cross-tabulated information remains largely inaccessible. Data on comorbidities
among individuals who died from Covid-19 are even more incomplete
and less accessible [HEUVELINE & TZEN, 2020: 8]. Given that
age is the most significant determinant of the risk of
severe Covid-19 outcomes and mortality, and that population heterogeneity is
substantially greater in age composition than in sex distribution [GUILMOTO,
2020: 9], it is methodologically justified, in an initial research
effort, to focus on age-related adjustments.
