Serological screening for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was conducted by trained personnel
utilizing immunochromatographic assay-based tests. The One Step COVID-2019 Test (Guangzhou
Wondfo BiotechÂ®, China) was employed to qualitatively detect the presence
of IgM and IgG antibodies in whole blood, serum, or
plasma samples, without differentiation between immunoglobulin classes [21].
