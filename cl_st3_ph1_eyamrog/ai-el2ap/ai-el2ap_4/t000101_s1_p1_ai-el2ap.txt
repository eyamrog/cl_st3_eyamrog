From a normative perspective, policy change is generally regarded as
essential for improving social conditions, reducing inequality, and promoting sustainability.
However, the implications of changes that involve the dismantling of
previously effective policies require further examination. It is important to
distinguish between democratic policy change and policy dismantling. To address
these issues, this article analyzes policy developments in Brazil since
Jair Bolsonaro assumed office in January 2019, focusing on the
experiences of the federal bureaucracy across various agencies and professional
sectors. The research design incorporates both quantitative and qualitative data,
collected through a survey of former and current federal employees
and semi-structured interviews with civil servants who have worked or
are currently working in the federal government. The findings suggest
that, in Brazil, policy dismantling differs significantly from routine policy
change, as it has been characterized by authoritarian practices that
have disrupted the federal bureaucracy and weakened state capacity.
