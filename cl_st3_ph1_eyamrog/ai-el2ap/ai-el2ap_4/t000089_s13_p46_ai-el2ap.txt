In voluntary-aided schools, the governing body determines the content of
the religious education (RE) syllabus and the nature of the
daily collective act of worship. The governors are also responsible
for staff employment and the formulation of admission policies. In
contrast, in voluntary-controlled schools, these responsibilities are held by the
local education authority (LEA). Due to historical developments within these
faith communities, the majority of state-funded faith schools in England
are either Christian or Jewish. Nevertheless, there are approximately twelve
state-funded Islamic schools and a small number of Sikh and
Hindu voluntary schools. Similar to Catholic and main Protestant schools
in Ireland, most of these faith schools allocate portions of
their RE syllabus to the study of other religious traditions.
