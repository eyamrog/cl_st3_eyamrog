In contrast to the case described by Bauer and Becker
(2020) in Peru, where a populist leaderâ€™s negative perception of
the state coincided with a weak administrative structure, Bolsonaro encountered
a strong and well-established administrative order in Brazil. While he
pursued neoliberal administrative reforms similar to those implemented by Fujimori,
guided by his Minister of the Economy, Paulo Guedes, Bolsonaro
also advanced an ideological agenda that conflicted with several core
areas of Brazilian public policy, including environmental protection, social inclusion,
racial and gender equality, and science-based public health. This conflict
resulted in authoritarian actions and processes designed to intimidate, marginalize,
and undermine the bureaucracy.
