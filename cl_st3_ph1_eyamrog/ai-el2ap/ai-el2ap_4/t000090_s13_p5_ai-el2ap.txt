In U-Multirank, institutions are classified into five performance groups for
each indicator: A (Very good), B (Good), C (Average), D
(Below average), and E (Weak). This classification approach is intended
to mitigate issues related to measurement accuracy, as grouping institutions
helps to minimize the impact of minor numerical differences that
fall within the margin of measurement error. As a result,
accuracy concerns are primarily limited to cases where institutions are
positioned at the boundaries between performance groups, thereby reducing the
overall effect of such issues. One consequence of this grouping
method is that a substantial number of institutions receive identical
grades.
