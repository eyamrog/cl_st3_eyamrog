This picturebook was selected for two primary reasons: first, it
features a simple plot that recounts various activities undertaken by
a child named Emily with her two fathers; these activities
are not exclusive to families with same-sex parents and could
occur in any family context. Second, the book presents a
symmetrical portrayal of both fathers, indicating that each is depicted
as equally important. Throughout the narrative, the child describes the
actions she engages in with each father.
