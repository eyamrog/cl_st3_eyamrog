Previous studies have demonstrated that adolescents are less likely than
adults to experience severe COVID-19, hospitalization, or mortality related to
COVID-19 (CDC, 2021; Stein, 2021). Additionally, research indicates that adolescents
who test positive for COVID-19 typically present with mild respiratory
symptoms such as fever, dry cough, and fatigue, or may
remain asymptomatic (Castagnoli et al., 2020). The incidence of multisystem
inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) among adolescents is reported to
be less than 1% (Hoste, Van Paemel, and Haerynck, 2021),
while approximately 5.1% may develop Long COVID (Mellis, 2021).
