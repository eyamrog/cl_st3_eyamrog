To examine the relationship between age and emoji use, four
Spearman’s rho analyses were conducted. Participants’ ages ranged from 21
to 60 years, with a mean age of 38 years.
The analyses indicated no significant correlations between age and cognitive
presence (rs = -.07, p = .62), teaching presence (rs
= .10, p = .44), social presence (rs = .04,
p = .74), or total presence (rs = -.002, p
= .99; see Table 7). These findings are consistent with
previous research, such as Fullwood, Orchard, and Floyd (2013), who
reported no significant differences in emoji use across age groups
in internet chat rooms, and Alshenqeeti (2016), who found that
age was a weaker predictor of emoji use compared to
technological awareness and capability. Thus, the present results corroborate existing
evidence that age is not a significant factor in emoji
use.
