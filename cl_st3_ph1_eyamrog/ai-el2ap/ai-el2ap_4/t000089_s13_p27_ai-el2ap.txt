In Britain, the multicultural provisions introduced by the Education Reform
Act (ERA) were subject to criticism for what some perceived
as an “Anglocentric” orientation in its core subjects. This critique
extends beyond history and geography, where the underrepresentation of non-English
and non-Western contributions to British identity is most evident, to
subjects such as arts and music, which frequently prioritize European
writers, painters, and composers. The report Diversity and Citizenship in
the Curriculum: Research Review (2007), commissioned by the Department for
Education and Skills (DfES), articulated this perspective. The authors observed
that the National Curriculum often promotes a conception of Britishness
that is closely associated with Englishness, thereby excluding other groups
such as the Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish, as well
as equating Britishness with “Whiteness” and Christianity (Maylor et al.,
2007, p. 6). To address the homogenizing tendencies of a
monocultural curriculum, the report recommends reforms aimed at incorporating minority
narratives and global perspectives into the construction of identity. Regarding
Religious Education (RE), the report highlights both a discrepancy between
classroom instruction and students’ actual religious practices, and the omission
of certain minority faiths, including traditional African-Caribbean religions.
