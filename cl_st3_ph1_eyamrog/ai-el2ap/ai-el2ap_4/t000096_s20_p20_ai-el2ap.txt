The knowledge society is characterized by the central role of
knowledge production, dissemination, and application in economic, social, and cultural
development. In this context, information and communication technologies (ICTs) facilitate
the rapid exchange and accessibility of information, leading to increased
innovation and the continuous evolution of skills and competencies. The
knowledge society emphasizes lifelong learning, critical thinking, and adaptability, as
individuals are required to process and utilize large volumes of
information effectively. These characteristics have significant implications for education, necessitating
curricula that foster digital literacy, collaborative problem-solving, and the ability
to engage with complex, interdisciplinary content. As a result, educational
systems must adapt to prepare learners for active participation in
a dynamic and interconnected digital society.
