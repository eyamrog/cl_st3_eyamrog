From the outset, the book demonstrates a complementary relationship between
image and verbal language, as noted by Painter et al.
(2013, p. 93), with each semiotic mode fulfilling a distinct
function in the construction of meaning. In this context, verbal
and visual elements are presented on facing pages, indicating that
both modalities are afforded equal significance. The analysis reveals that
the book employs a distinctive arrangement of visual and written
texts, characterized by a clear separation between image and verbiage.
Furthermore, the written text occupies a dedicated space within the
layout, typically appearing on its own page either preceding or
following the corresponding visual element it describes or references.
