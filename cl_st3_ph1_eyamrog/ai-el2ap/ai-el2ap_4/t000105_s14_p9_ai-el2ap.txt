The data collection team consisted of researchers, interviewers, and phlebotomists.
Interviewers were recruited from the academic community, specifically among students
who were currently enrolled in undergraduate or graduate programs. Candidates
participated in interviews to assess their availability and interest in
the project. Following the selection process, the chosen students were
provided with a digital document and a video outlining the
research objectives.
