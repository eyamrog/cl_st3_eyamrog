The taxa assigned to Pleroma are distinguished by the presence
of deciduous sepals in the fruit, a hypanthium lacking scale-like
trichomes, stamens with anthers that are typically purple to lilac
in color (occasionally cream or white), a pedoconnective that is
well developed below the thecae, and filaments that are usually
covered with setose or glandular trichomes. These taxa are distributed
across a range of environments, including forested areas, high-altitude grasslands,
rocky fields, and shrub-tree restinga formations (Fraga and Guimarães 2014;
Guimarães and Freitas 2015). In a floristic survey conducted in
Serra Negra, three species of Chaetogastra and ten species of
Pleroma were recorded (Justino 2016), one of which is a
new species described in this study.
