Typically, characters are not depicted on pages containing written text,
with the exception of page 17, where Daddy appears to
the left of the written text, thereby assigning greater prominence
to the text. Conversely, on page 21, Dad and Max
are positioned above the written text, which accords greater significance
to the visual elements due to their placement at the
top of the page. This arrangement aligns with Kress and
van Leeuwenâ€™s (2006, p. 187) framework, in which the upper
position is associated with the function of the "ideal."
