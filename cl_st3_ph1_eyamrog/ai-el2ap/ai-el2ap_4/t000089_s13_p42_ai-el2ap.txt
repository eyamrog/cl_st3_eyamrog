In other Christian schools, the Follow Me programme structures religious
education for children from the Church of Ireland, Presbyterian, and
Methodist backgrounds. The programme includes a distinct component focused on
the study of other faiths, which aims to promote knowledge
and critical evaluation of various religious traditions. According to the
Board of Education (2018), this component emphasizes that pupils from
third to sixth class are expected to develop awareness of,
and sensitivity toward, the beliefs and practices of individuals of
other or no faiths who may be members of their
school or local communities.
