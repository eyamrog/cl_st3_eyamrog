The interviewers were organized into teams, each supervised by one
of six researchers. All teams participated in online training sessions
led by the coordinators, during which the project objectives, data
collection methodology, and the interview questionnaire were presented. Following the
online training, in-person sessions were held at the Medical School
of the Federal University of Ouro Preto to provide instruction
on the use of the digital questionnaire (Appendix 1), appropriate
approaches for engaging interviewees, ethical considerations, and biosafety procedures relevant
to data collection.
