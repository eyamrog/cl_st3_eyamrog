Significant inaction was observed. The Minister previously served as a
church pastor and did not have a professional background in
the field of interest. Although he was reportedly affiliated with
a university, his role was limited to that of a
professor and did not involve participation in university administration. His
primary experience remained in pastoral work. This situation was characterized
as a policy of dismantling and inaction (interview 58).
