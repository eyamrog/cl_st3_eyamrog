The reports were prepared by members of the laboratory team
using Microsoft ExcelÂ® spreadsheets, which included participant-provided information such as
full name, date of birth, and contact phone number, as
well as the results of the serological test (classified as
reactive or non-reactive). Additionally, the reports contained explanations regarding the
interpretation of the test results and recommended precautions. Contact information
for the Health Surveillance Departments of each city was also
provided to enable participants to seek clarification and receive guidance
on appropriate procedures, particularly for those with positive test results.
