ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test was used to compare thalli
weights across the three cultivation weeks within each treatment. Final
weights from the immersion treatments with 5% liquid detergent and
1% povidone iodine were compared to the control using ANOVA,
while the Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to compare final weights
from the 5% liquid detergent and 0.2% sodium hypochlorite treatments
to the control. Relative growth rates (RGRs) of thalli immersed
in 5% liquid detergent and 0.2% sodium hypochlorite were analyzed
in comparison to the control using ANOVA and Tukey’s test.
The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare RGRs of thalli
immersed in 5% liquid detergent and 1% povidone iodine to
the control.
