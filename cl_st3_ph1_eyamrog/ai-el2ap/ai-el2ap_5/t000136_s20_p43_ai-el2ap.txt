The analysis of external forces, such as those discussed by
Desai and Yetman (2015), particularly regarding the donation market and
its influence on governance configuration in the third sector, remains
limited by a lack of operational and empirical evidence. The
governance structure identified in this research reflects the combined impact
of both internal and external forces, including the dynamics of
the donation market, on nonprofit organization (NPO) governance. Renz (2007)
suggests that project governance addresses the gap between governance (strategy)
and project management (operation) within the third sector, adapting concepts
typically applied to for-profit organizations. Building on this perspective, the
present study proposes that projects influence governance by introducing temporary
governance mechanisms, thereby contributing to the ongoing (re)configuration of governance
structures through a continuous process.
