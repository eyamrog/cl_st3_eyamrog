The variables in this study were organized into three blocks
to collectively evaluate the indicators associated with femicide using Pearson's
correlation coefficient (r). The direction and magnitude of associations among
the independent variables were examined through a correlation matrix, with
the blocks defined as follows: (1) socioeconomic status, (2) demographic
status, and (3) services and health status. To account for
differences in measurement scales and to facilitate their inclusion and
interpretation in the model, all variables were standardized to have
a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.
