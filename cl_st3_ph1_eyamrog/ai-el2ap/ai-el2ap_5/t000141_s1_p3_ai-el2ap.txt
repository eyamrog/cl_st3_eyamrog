Plans, decrees, and technical notes were identified for 18 Brazilian
federal units. In the majority of these documents, the scientific
team consisted exclusively of technical staff (n = 10). The
number of indicators identified per document ranged from 2 to
11 and were classified into five categories: frequency and distribution
of the disease; social and collective adherence; installed capacity or
service profile; productive potential; and availability of supplies.
