In general, the main concepts presented in the report by
Faure et al. (1973) are those of “educational cities” and
“lifelong education.” The concept of educational cities refers to societies
in which educational concerns are central to all social institutions,
resulting in learning and teaching becoming integral aspects of daily
urban life. The concept of lifelong education, in turn, extends
learning beyond formal schooling by acknowledging that individuals are never
fully formed; rather, personal development is understood as an ongoing,
continuous process throughout life.
