Based on these results, it is important to maintain exchange
rate fluctuations within a specific range to support the value
of the national currency, facilitate foreign trade, promote economic growth
and employment, and potentially reduce mortality among women and girls.
This study contributes to the literature by providing the first
empirical analysis of this subject using current and advanced methodologies.
The independence of central banks, whose primary responsibility is to
preserve the value of the national currency, and the implementation
of appropriate monetary policies are of critical importance. Policymakers have
significant responsibilities in addressing and preventing violence and femicide against
women and girls, which have become increasingly prevalent and, in
some cases, normalized through certain discourses and policies. Future research
should further investigate the economic dimensions of widespread and systematic
violence against women and girls, including femicide.
