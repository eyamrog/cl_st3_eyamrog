This study did not aim to compare the effectiveness of
1% povidone iodine with that of 0.2% sodium hypochlorite, but
rather to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments 1 through 7
relative to the control. All laboratory glassware used in the
procedures was sterilized by immersion in 0.2% sodium hypochlorite overnight,
followed by washing and drying in a laboratory drying oven
at 120 Â°C for a minimum of four hours.
