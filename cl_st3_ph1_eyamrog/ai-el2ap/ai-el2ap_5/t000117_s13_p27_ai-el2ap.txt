While children engage in free interaction with their environment and
peers, teachers—referred to as "educators"—primarily observe the children's spontaneous play.
In the pedagogical framework outlined in Demmuring Childhood, there is
an emphasis on preserving both nature and childhood. This approach
advocates for protecting the "natural child" from adult-driven pedagogical interventions,
which are often associated with adherence to the "cognitive development
paradigm," the belief that "learning only occurs when the body
is sitting still," and the notion that "the classroom is
the central setting for educational activities."
