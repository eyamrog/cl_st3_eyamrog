Gas exchange parameters, chlorophyll fluorescence, and photosynthetic pigment content were
measured at 60, 90, 120, and 150 days after the
initiation of treatments (DAT). Leaf anatomical characteristics and biomass production
were assessed at 90 and 150 DAT. For each plant,
three leaf samples were collected from the upper, middle, and
lower canopy regions.
