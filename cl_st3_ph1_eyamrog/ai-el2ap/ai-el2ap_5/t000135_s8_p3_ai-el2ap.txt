Primary Health Care (PHC) has played a critical role during
the COVID-19 pandemic by facilitating effective care coordination. PHC is
responsible for maintaining preventive measures, providing care to priority groups,
and managing certain emergency cases related to chronic diseases. Additionally,
PHC contributes to controlling the spread of infection and monitoring
mild or asymptomatic cases in home isolation, as well as
engaging with the community. However, the specific impact of the
pandemic on PHC and health services in Brazil, particularly in
relation to certain aspects of care, remains unclear. Therefore, the
objective of this article is to describe the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic on Primary Health Care in Brazil, with
a focus on medical appointments, diabetes management, and prenatal procedures
within the National Health System.
