3. Deal fairly with professional writers: The third step concerns
media articles and trade book chapters (including poetry) that are
not institutionally licensed. These works are primarily produced by professional
writers and their publishers, who, in our view, should receive
appropriate royalties. University faculty assign these materials because they are
integral to fulfilling both their own and their institution’s instructional
objectives. While academic authors may benefit from increased reputation, professional
authors are equally entitled to recognition and compensation, rather than
being subject to a broad fair-dealing exception in the Canadian
educational market, which serves approximately one million students. Further discussion
of the financial and existential “substantial adverse effect” is provided
below.
