Twenty-five contiguous 7 x 7 m plots were delineated using
string and stakes. Vegetation was cut with a brush cutter
and removed from the area. Ten permanent plots were then
randomly selected using the Research Randomizer system (https://www.randomizer.org/), with five
assigned as treatment plots and five as control plots. Integrated
soil samples from a depth of 0–20 cm were collected
following the protocol described by De Arruda et al. (2014)
to assess physical and chemical properties. On October 12, 2017,
two composite soil samples were collected from each of the
ten plots at a depth of 0–20 cm using an
auger, as described by De Arruda et al. (2014), for
subsequent chemical (organic matter), physical (moisture), and microbiological analyses, resulting
in a total of 20 samples.
