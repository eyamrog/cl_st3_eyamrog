The high potassium content suggests the presence of primary minerals
and limited weathering, a characteristic commonly observed in soils from
arid regions (Sobral et al. 2015). Among the micronutrients, zinc
is notably absorbed by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (De Novais et
al. 2017), which may explain the observed reduction in its
concentration between samples. Manganese levels were classified as high (Sobral
et al. 2015), but a decrease was recorded during the
dry season (July), consistent with findings reported by Bezerra (2017).
Aluminum concentrations also declined in the dry season, although they
remained below thresholds known to affect sporulation. Cardoso and Kuyper
(2006) documented increased uptake of these elements by plant-associated arbuscular
mycorrhizal fungi, resulting in reduced soil concentrations and a potential
decrease in soil toxicity for plants. Overall, the results from
the integrated soil samples in the experimental unit support the
continuous presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi throughout the study period.
