In recent decades, the abundance and productivity of lianas in
tropical forests have increased, primarily as a result of high
rates of deforestation and anthropogenic climate change (Granados & KÃ¶rner
2002, Phillips et al. 2002, Wright et al. 2004, Zhu
et al. 2004, Schnitzer & Bongers 2011). Evidence also suggests
that, in mature and undisturbed forests, increased liana density may
be a consequence of changes in precipitation patterns (Schnitzer &
Bongers 2011). Light availability is another significant factor influencing liana
growth and distribution; for instance, increased solar radiation has been
shown to enhance the growth rates of liana seedlings (Kurzel
et al. 2006, Schnitzer & Bongers 2011). Lianas are also
exposed to varying amounts and spectral qualities of radiation during
their development. Consequently, lianas are expected to exhibit high phenotypic
plasticity in photosynthetic and gas exchange responses to different light
conditions (Bazzaz & Carlson 1982, Ribeiro et al. 2005). The
degree of stomatal opening regulates the balance between CO2 uptake
and water loss through transpiration (Caemmerer & Baker 2007). Adaptive
success under varying light conditions depends on modifications in leaf
morphology, anatomy, and the photosynthetic apparatus, which together enhance the
efficiency of converting radiant energy into carbohydrates to support plant
growth (Dias-Filho 1997, Campos & Uchida 2002, Gratani 2014).
