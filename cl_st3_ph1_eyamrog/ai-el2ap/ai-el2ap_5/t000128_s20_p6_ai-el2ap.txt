Such variation may result from differences in extraction methods, as
the extract may contain molecules capable of penetrating the outer
membrane of Gram-negative bacterial cell walls, but not those of
Gram-positive bacteria (Duffy and Power, 2001). Additionally, the presence of
specific phytochemical compounds in the extract may lead to greater
bioactivity against Gram-negative bacteria due to a higher affinity for
the lipid structure of their membranes. This is supported by
Engel et al. (2017), who observed that the Salmonella strains
used in their study were more sensitive than Staphylococcus aureus
strains to disinfectants containing either carvacrol or thymol.
