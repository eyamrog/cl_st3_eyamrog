Floral bract measurements were taken from structures located in the
middle portion of the inflorescence. Additional data were obtained from
specialized literature (Smith & Downs 1977; Reitz 1983; Costa et
al. 2007; Rosa 2011; Flora do Brasil 2020, in preparation),
as well as from the Brazilian virtual herbarium Herb√°rio Virtual
REFLORA (continuously updated) and the speciesLink network.
