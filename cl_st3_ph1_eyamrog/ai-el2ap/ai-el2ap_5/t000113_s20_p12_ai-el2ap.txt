Throughout history, stereotypes related to gender, social or financial status,
race, religion, and economic situation have influenced the stratification of
society and the formation and definition of oppressed groups. In
this context, the Social Dominance Theory (SDT) (Sidanius & Pratto,
1999), which is employed in this study, seeks to integrate
social psychological theories of intergroup relations with the ideologies and
processes that legitimize social inequalities (Islam, 2014).
