Several approaches have been proposed to address this problem. In
this study, we employ an alternative method to classify universities
as a whole. Specifically, we first calculate the average of
the indicators within each dimension, and subsequently compute a global
average using the values obtained from each dimension. This approach
assigns equal weight to each dimension, regardless of the number
of indicators within them, and avoids assigning nearly identical importance
to grades B and E, as is the case with
the "U-Multirank" methodology.
