In this context, the temporality of governance in the third
sector is a significant consideration. Nonprofit organizations (NPOs) typically pursue
their institutional missions through the implementation of projects (Diallo and
Thuillier, 2004). A project, defined as a temporary endeavor undertaken
to produce a specific outcome (Project Management Institute, 2017), constitutes
the primary subject of the contractual relationship between the NPO
and the donor organization. Such projects are executed within a
predetermined timeframe and are characterized by a defined scope, quality
standards, and budget, in exchange for a donation, and are
governed by a contract or similar agreement between the parties.
Consequently, the project serves as the object of the contract,
which establishes the agency relationship between the NPO (as agent)
and the donor organization (as principal). In this study, the
analysis is limited to donations that are subject to donor-imposed
restrictions, in accordance with this framework.
