Crosslinguistically, notable differences can be observed between examples (10)a and
(11)a, which can be attributed to specific lexical properties of
Portuguese that differ from those of English. In Brazilian Portuguese,
the construction corresponding to (10)a does not involve an appositive
clause; instead, it features a complement clause that is selected
by a preposition.
