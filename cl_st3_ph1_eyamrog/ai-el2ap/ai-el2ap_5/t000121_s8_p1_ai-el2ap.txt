The International Health Regulations [World Health Organization (WHO), 2005, p.
9] define a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)
as an extraordinary event that (i) constitutes a public health
risk to other countries through the international spread of disease
and (ii) potentially requires a coordinated international response. Recognized as
the highest level of alert by the WHO, PHEICs have
previously been declared only in response to the H1N1 pandemic
(2009), the international spread of poliovirus (2014), the Ebola outbreaks
(2014 and 2018), and the increase in cases of microcephaly
and congenital malformations associated with Zika virus infection (2016) [Pan-American
Health Organization (PAHO) & WHO, 2020].
