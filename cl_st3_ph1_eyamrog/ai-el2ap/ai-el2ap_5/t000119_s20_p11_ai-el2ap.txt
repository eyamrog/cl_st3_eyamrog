These results have ecological significance because understanding the tolerance of
plant species to salinity is essential for determining suitable crop
types for specific environments, particularly in saline areas, and for
implementing appropriate management and irrigation practices to prevent further salinity
accumulation (Pereira et al. 2017). The observed low tolerance to
water stress in common rue indicates limited adaptive capacity and
suggests that this species has a reduced ability to establish
in areas with water scarcity due to its narrow germination
requirements.
