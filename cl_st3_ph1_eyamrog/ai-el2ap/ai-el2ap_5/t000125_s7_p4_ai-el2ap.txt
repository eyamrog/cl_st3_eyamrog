Subsequently, additional international university rankings were established. The “Webometrics Ranking
of World Universities” (http://www.webometrics.info/en; Aguillo, Ortega, & Fernandez, 2008) was
introduced in 2004. The “THE-QS” ranking also emerged and was
later divided in 2010 into the “Times Higher Education World
University Rankings” (THE) (https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings) and the “QS World University Rankings”
(QS) (https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings). Following these developments, several countries initiated their own
regional or national university rankings (Shin & Toutkoushian, 2011; Righetti,
2015, 2019).
