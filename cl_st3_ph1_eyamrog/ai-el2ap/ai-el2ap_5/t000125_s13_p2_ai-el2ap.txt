As previously explained, U-Multirank does not provide an overall classification
of universities but instead evaluates them based on specific performance
indicators, which are organized into five dimensions. This approach highlights
the strengths and weaknesses of each university within each indicator
and dimension. Users have the flexibility to create customized rankings
by selecting the dimensions and indicators that are most relevant
to their individual requirements.
