The total number of spores of each species was determined
through microscopic examination of individual slides, following the methodology described
by De Paula (2016). Ecological indices related to species richness,
including the total number of sampled individuals, absolute frequency (Fa),
and relative frequency (Fr), were calculated using the following equations:
