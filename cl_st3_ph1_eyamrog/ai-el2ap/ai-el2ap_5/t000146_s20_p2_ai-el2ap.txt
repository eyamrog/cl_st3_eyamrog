In contrast, Brazil demonstrates a higher proportion of publications in
languages other than its national language, with 17.8% of articles
published in English, followed by the United States, where 16.1%
of articles are published in Spanish and 10.5% in Portuguese,
indicating a notable contribution from US-based authors. Brazil has actively
pursued the internationalization of its academic journals, as evidenced by
the increased presence of publications in foreign languages. In comparison,
journals from Peru and Colombia predominantly publish articles in their
respective national languages.
