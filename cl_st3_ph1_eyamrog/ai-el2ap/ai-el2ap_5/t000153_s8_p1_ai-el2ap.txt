Depending on the context, individuals associated with abortion may experience
stigma in various forms. This includes women and girls who
choose to have an abortion, as well as those who
provide support, healthcare professionals involved in abortion services, and pro-choice
activists. However, all of these individuals have the potential to
resist or counteract such stigma.
