The reptilian species richness observed in the PNT was comparatively
high relative to other Atlantic Forest remnants in the state
of Rio de Janeiro. For instance, short-term research at Morro
São João, Casimiro de Abreu, reported nine species (Almeida-Gomes et
al. 2008), while a medium-term study at Reserva Ecológica de
Guapiaçu documented 37 species (Almeida-Gomes et al. 2014a). Additionally, a
short-term study by Vrcibradic et al. (2011) at the Estação
Ecológica Estadual do Paraíso identified a total of 29 species
when secondary data were included.
