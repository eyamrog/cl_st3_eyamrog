Altitudinal zones II and III contained the highest number of
families, with 12 and 17 families, respectively (Figure 4). Several
families were restricted to a single altitudinal zone: Pterobryaceae (1
species) in zone I; Orthotrichaceae (2 species), Calymperaceae, and Rhacocarpaceae
(1 species each) in zone II; Mniaceae (2 species), Phyllogoniaceae,
Pilotrichaceae, and Neckeraceae (1 species each) in zone III; and
Hedwigiaceae (1 species) in zone IV. The family Bryaceae was
the most widespread, occurring in all zones, and exhibited the
highest species richness in zone III, with a total of
four species. A diagnostic characterization of endemic species and new
records (indicated by *) is provided below, with families listed
in alphabetical order.
