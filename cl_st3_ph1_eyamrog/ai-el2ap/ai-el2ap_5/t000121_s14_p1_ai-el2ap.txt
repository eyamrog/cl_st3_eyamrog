A total of 2,042 Brazilian participants, comprising both males and
females aged between 18 and 78 years, were included in
the study conducted in late March 2020. The sample predominantly
consisted of individuals residing in the Northeast region (80%, n
= 1,634), with 14.1% (n = 288) from the Southeast
and 5.9% (n = 120) from other regions of the
country. Within the Northeast region, 74.6% (n = 1,219) of
participants were from the state of Sergipe. A non-probabilistic convenience
sampling method was employed, and data were collected online. The
sole inclusion criterion was being over 18 years of age.
