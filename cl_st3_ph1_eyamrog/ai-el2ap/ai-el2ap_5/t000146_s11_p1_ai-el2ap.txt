As reported in previous studies[10], the majority of articles published
in the Web of Science, a leading international scientific database,
are in English, accounting for 95.87% of the total, followed
by Spanish at 3%. Among European Union member countries, 93%
of documents are written in English, with German (2.64%), French
(1.71%), and Spanish (1.36%) comprising smaller proportions. In Latin American
(LAC) countries, 86% of records are published in English, with
Portuguese and Spanish representing 7.35% and 6.77%, respectively. These data
indicate that English serves as the primary language of scientific
collaboration between European Union and Latin American countries (EU-LAC), although
Spanish also maintains a notable presence. This trend is attributable
to the significant role of Spain in scientific collaboration with
Latin America and the recent increase in Spanish-language scientific journals
indexed in the Web of Science, particularly those published in
Latin American countries. The expansion of Web of Science coverage
between 2005 and 2010 (TESTA, 2011) contributed to this increase,
with the number of indexed journals in Brazil rising from
27 to 132, and Argentina, Chile, and Mexico reaching 15,
35, and 26 indexed journals, respectively. According to Collazo-Reyes [12],
the increased presence of Brazilian journals resulted in Portuguese becoming
the second most widely used language in the regionâ€™s scientific
output for the first time.
