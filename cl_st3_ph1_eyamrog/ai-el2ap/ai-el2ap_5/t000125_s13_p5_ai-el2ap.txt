As anticipated, data provided by universities and students are not
always available, as some do not respond to the questionnaires.
Additionally, the reliability and accuracy of the collected data may
be limited. This represents a limitation of the ranking; however,
it is not critical, as the primary objective is not
to produce a comprehensive classification. Users can utilize the available
information and disregard any missing data as needed.
