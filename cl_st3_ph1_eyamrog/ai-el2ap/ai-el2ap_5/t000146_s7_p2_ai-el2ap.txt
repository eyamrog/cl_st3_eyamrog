These questions, which are well established within the social sciences
and humanities, are central to the ongoing debate regarding how
to address the local characteristics of certain scientific communities while
simultaneously ensuring compliance with the research standards expected by an
international audience. The social sciences and humanities not only examine
but also engage with and contribute to culture and society,
which often necessitates the dissemination of research findings in languages
other than English [8]. This issue is further complicated in
the current context of increasing scientific openness and heightened awareness
of the local social impacts of research outcomes [9].
