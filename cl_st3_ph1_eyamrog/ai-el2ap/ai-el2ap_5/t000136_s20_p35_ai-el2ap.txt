The results of this study indicate that, within the sample
of Brazilian organizations, public certifications granted to NPOs (such as
OS, OSCIP, or CEBAS) do not contribute to an increase
in donations with donor restrictions. Therefore, Brazilian donors do not
appear to respond positively to NPO certification in terms of
donation volume. This finding suggests that donors may not perceive
significant benefits, either tangible or intangible, associated with these certifications.
Several factors may explain this outcome: (i) a potential lack
of credibility attributed to the certifying authority (the Brazilian State),
which may undermine the expected legitimacy and reputational advantages typically
conferred by such certifications; (ii) the possibility that uncertified NPOs
have voluntarily adopted non-mandatory governance mechanisms in response to donor
expectations (Lacruz et al., 2019), making it difficult for donors
to distinguish between certified and uncertified organizations based solely on
governance practices; or (iii) the sufficiency of existing governance mechanisms,
which may render formal certification unnecessary from the perspective of
donors.
