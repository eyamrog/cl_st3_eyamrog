Amphibians and reptiles were surveyed in Sector A of the
park over a 36-month period, from January 2013 to December
2015, at elevations ranging from 400 m to 800 m
above sea level. Surveys followed the Visual Encounter Survey (VES)
method described by Crump and Scott (1994), resulting in a
total sampling effort of 460 person-hours, equally divided between diurnal
(230 hours) and nocturnal (230 hours) searches. During each active
search, two researchers systematically traversed the forest, examining microhabitats such
as streams, ponds, bromeliads, leaf litter, tree trunks, and rocks
for the presence of amphibians and reptiles. Searches were conducted
in a single direction to minimize the likelihood of resampling
individuals and to ensure the independence of records. All individuals
encountered were captured, identified, and most were released at the
site of capture. Voucher specimens were collected and deposited in
the herpetological collection of the Museu Nacional (MNRJ), Universidade Federal
do Rio de Janeiro (voucher numbers provided in Appendix 1).
The inventory was supplemented with secondary records, including data from
herpetological collections (Appendix 2) and from a faunal reintroduction project
in the PNT. Scientific nomenclature for amphibians followed Frost (2020),
while reptile nomenclature was based on Costa and BÃ©rnils (2018),
with updates as necessary according to Poe et al. (2017)
and Hoogmoed et al. (2019).
