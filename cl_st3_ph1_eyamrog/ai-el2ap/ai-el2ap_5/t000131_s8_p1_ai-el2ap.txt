Lianas are commonly occurring life forms in tropical and subtropical
forests (Gentry & Dodson 1987) that occupy all forest strata
through diverse mechanisms of ascension, growth patterns, and physiological strategies
(Schnitzer & Bongers 2002; Gerwing 2004; Kazda et al. 2009).
Liana stems are relatively thin and require external support to
access sunlight. Consequently, liana species typically allocate less carbon to
stem growth and more to photosynthetic and vascular tissues (Putz
1984; Schnitzer 2005), which confers a competitive advantage over trees
by enabling higher growth rates (Zhu & Cao 2009). Furthermore,
their capacity for both lateral and vertical growth facilitates canopy
invasion, allowing lianas to extend long branches and reach favorable
light conditions (Schnitzer & Bongers 2002; Toledo et al. 2003).
Due to their high light requirements, lianas are often classified
as gap-dependent pioneer species and exhibit distribution patterns similar to
those of pioneer tree species (Putz 1984; Schnitzer & Bongers
2002). However, some liana species are also capable of germinating
and growing in the understory (Nabe-Nielsen 2002; Sanches & VÃ¡lio
2002; Schnitzer et al. 2012), indicating a degree of shade
tolerance (Gerwing 2004).
