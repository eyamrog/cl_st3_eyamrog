This article examines governance as a multidimensional construct, measured by
specific governance factors, and its influence on donations with donor
restrictions received by environmental nonprofit organizations (NPOs) in Brazil, within
the framework of agency theory. Data were collected via a
survey, resulting in a random sample of 108 observations. Governance
dimensions were identified using Multiple Correspondence Analysis. Subsequently, Partial Least
Squares Structural Equation Modeling was employed to assess whether governance
impacts donations. The analysis indicates that governance has a positive
effect on donations, while public certifications granted to NPOs in
Brazil do not moderate the relationship between governance and donations.
These results suggest that effective governance facilitates greater access to
the donations market for NPOs, whereas public certifications do not
significantly enhance donation levels. The findings are relevant for practitioners
and contribute to the ongoing discussion regarding public policy for
the third sector in environments with limited regulatory oversight.
