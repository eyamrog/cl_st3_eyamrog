For these reasons, the concept of lifelong education is increasingly
emphasized, as it offers significant advantages in terms of flexibility,
diversity, and accessibility across different times and contexts. The notion
of lifelong education requires reconsideration and expansion, not only to
address the necessary adaptations to changes in professional life but
also to support the ongoing development of individuals’ knowledge, skills,
and capacities for critical judgment and action. Lifelong education should
foster self-awareness, an understanding of one’s environment, and the ability
to fulfill social roles as both workers and citizens (Delors
et al., 1998, p. 18).
