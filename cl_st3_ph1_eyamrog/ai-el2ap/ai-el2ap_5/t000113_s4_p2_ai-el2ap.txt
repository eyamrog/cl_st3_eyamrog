Considering the exposure of Black Brazilian women to a cycle
of cumulative disadvantages, as identified by Hasenbalg (2005), and in
light of Erikson's stages of psychosocial development, these factors can
influence key aspects such as trust, autonomy, initiative, constructiveness, identity,
intimacy, productivity, and integrity. Among the various consequences, one of
the most significant is the impact on self-esteem, which encompasses
self-knowledge, self-concept, self-assessment, and self-acceptance. Self-esteem serves as a synthesis
of earlier developmental stages, during which individuals establish their value
systems and develop their abilities (Rodríguez Estrada, Pellicer de Flores,
& Domínguez, 1988).
