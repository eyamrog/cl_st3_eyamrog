However, from the late twentieth century onward, there was a
notable migration of both Naichi and Okinawan descendants, as well
as their non-Japanese spouses, to Japan. Upon arrival, these individuals
encountered a society that was often resistant to difference and
characterized by significant levels of racism and prejudice. The shared
experience of discrimination in Japan contributed to a reduction in
the internal distinctions between Okinawan and Naichi descendants, leading to
the formation of Brazilian communities in Japan that transcended the
divisions previously observed in Brazil.
