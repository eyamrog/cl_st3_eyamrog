Although forage grasses exhibit high species richness, shrub species also
play a significant role in cattle diets. Preliminary microhistological analyses
of cattle feces (Klich & Peralta 2019; Klich et al.,
unpublished) indicate that certain shrub taxa, including Lycium L., Larrea,
Schinus L., Prosopis L., Elaeagnus angustifolia, Atriplex lampa (Moq.) D.Dietr.,
and Ephedra ochreata Miers, are consumed at frequencies comparable to
those of many grass species. This finding is notable given
the high abundance of these shrub species within the Monte
ecoregion plant community. Additionally, more than 70% of the plant
species consumed by cattle are native to the region (Fig.
3b).
