Analysis of variance of the germination data for common rue
seeds indicated significant differences related to both the type of
salt and the osmotic potential of the solutions (Figures 1
and 2). The highest germination percentage was observed in the
control treatment without added salts (82%), while increasing concentrations of
NaCl resulted in a significant linear decline in germination. Additionally,
germination percentages dropped below 50% at osmotic potentials equal to
or lower than -0.1 MPa in CaCl2 treatments (Figure 1a).
