In response to pressure from civil society, a set of
laws collectively referred to as the National Education Pillars and
Guidelines Laws (NEPGL) was enacted. The first of these, Law
No. 9394/1996, mandated the universalization of primary and secondary education
within the federal education system and indicated the necessity for
higher education to expand access, given the anticipated increase in
high school graduates (Federative Republic of Brazil 2017a). Law 9394/1996
is therefore considered the foundation for subsequent public policies aimed
at broadening access to higher education in Brazil; it restructured
the organization of the education system, permitted the establishment of
private higher education institutions (HEIs), and enabled the provision of
distance continuing education for professionals. Following the implementation of Law
9394/1996, enrollment in higher education increased from 1,868,529 in 1996
to 2,694,245 in 2000, nearly reaching the projected target for
2004. These data reflect an increase in enrollment of 20.6%
from 1980 to 1994, 28% from 1994 to 1998, and
42.6% from 1994 to 1999. By 2010, the effects of
the law were evident, with higher education enrollment reaching 6,379,299,
and further increasing to 8,450,755 in 2018 (National Institute of
Studies and Educational Research An√≠sio Teixeira, 2000a; 2000b; 2001; 2012;
2019). Nevertheless, this legislative framework did not adequately address persistent
challenges such as social vulnerability, geographic barriers, systemic racial or
ethnic exclusion, socioeconomic disparities, and deficiencies in the quality of
public primary and secondary education.
