Individuals with suspected COVID-19 have been found to exhibit higher
levels of depressive symptoms and report a lower quality of
life compared to those without the disease (Nguyen et al.,
2020). Anxiety in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic can
be conceptualized as comprising three primary components: worry, fear, and
uncertainty, all of which are prevalent during this period (Barari
et al., 2020; Dong & Bouey, 2020; Faro et al.,
2020; Kong et al., 2020). The ongoing situation is characterized
by significant uncertainty regarding the availability of effective vaccines or
treatments and the timeline for the resolution of the pandemic.
Concurrently, individuals experience fear related to the risk of infection,
the possibility of death, either personally or among close contacts,
and the effects of social isolation. Additionally, anxiety is exacerbated
by concerns about the long-term consequences and challenges anticipated in
the post-pandemic period.
