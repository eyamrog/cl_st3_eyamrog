This ranking is not widely represented in Brazil, with only
20 Brazilian institutions included. Similarly, South America as a whole
has only 35 universities listed. Given the increasing global prominence
of this ranking, further efforts are warranted to enhance the
representation and reporting of institutions from these regions.
