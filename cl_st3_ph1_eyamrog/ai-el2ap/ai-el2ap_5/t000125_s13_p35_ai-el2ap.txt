Three institutions that were not listed in previous years have
appeared in the current ranking: ESPM (Escola Superior de Propaganda
e Marketing), Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul,
and State University of Maringá. All three institutions are ranked
highly, with ESPM in first place, Pontifical Catholic University of
Rio Grande do Sul in sixth, and State University of
Maringá in seventh. This outcome likely reflects significant efforts by
these institutions to report data to U-Multirank. It is important
to note that ESPM is not a university but a
smaller academic institution, which suggests that further research is necessary
to understand the impact of institutional size on ranking position.
