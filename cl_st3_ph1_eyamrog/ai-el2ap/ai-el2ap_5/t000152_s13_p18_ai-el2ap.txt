The efficiency and accessibility of technology are not the only
challenges that higher education institutions (HEIs) encounter when resuming their
courses; they must also address resistance among faculty members who
perceive online modalities as a potential source of increased job
insecurity and diminished autonomy and control. Additionally, many higher education
instructors report feeling inadequately prepared to use digital technologies and
platforms. Research indicates that teacher education programs include limited coursework
on information and communication technologies (ICT) (Lopes and Fürkotter 2016).
Other studies highlight educators’ concerns regarding the lack of physical
interaction in distance education (Carmo and Franco 2019), critically assess
the negative effects of increased workload on teachers (Chaquime and
Mill 2016), and identify apprehension about insufficient technological proficiency and
the possibility of not meeting student expectations (Rosa 2013).
