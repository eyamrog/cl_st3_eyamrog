To identify glomerospores, 50 grams of each soil sample were
weighed, and spores were extracted using wet sieving (Gerdemann &
Nicolson 1963) followed by density gradient centrifugation (Daniels & Skipper
1982). The extracted spores were mounted on microscopy slides with
PVLG (lacto-glycerol polyvinyl alcohol) and Melzer resin (De Novais et
al. 2017). Morphological characterization was performed according to Schenck &
PÃ©rez (1990), and taxonomic identification was conducted based on the
criteria described by Morton (2018), Blaszkowski (2018), and Goto &
Jobim (2019).
