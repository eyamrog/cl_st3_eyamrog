The data indicate that the anchor and the apposition can
exchange positions in example (19), but not in (20), providing
further evidence for the syntactic non-correspondence of these structures. A
third observation regarding this asymmetry concerns the possibility of extraposing
the apposition, which is permitted in (15) but not in
(16), as demonstrated in examples (21) and (22) below.
