This study examines the relationship between the foreign exchange rate
and femicide in Turkey, a country characterized by a persistent
current account deficit and reliance on short-term foreign capital. The
research employs both current and advanced empirical analyses. Prior to
analyzing femicide from an economic perspective, it is necessary to
clarify the rationale for focusing on the foreign exchange rate
by outlining its effects on individuals. The foreign exchange rate
is a key instrument in orthodox anti-inflationary stabilization programs, with
implications that extend beyond international trade and capital flows. Policies
implemented by central banks and political authorities, primarily aimed at
maintaining the value of the national currency, have widespread effects
on various aspects of economic and social life. In Turkey,
foreign exchange rate policies have been identified as significant contributors
to economic crises. Empirical evidence indicates a linear relationship between
the exchange rate, foreign trade, and unemployment. Furthermore, the foreign
exchange rate influences the labor market through its impact on
imports and exports. An increase in imports can alter employer-employee
relations, potentially resulting in changes or terminations of rights and
regulations concerning wages, labor, and working conditions, often to the
detriment of employees. Research demonstrates that a 10% increase in
competition between imported and domestic goods is associated with a
1.6% decrease in wages and a rise in unemployment. Additionally,
currency crises have been shown to significantly affect unemployment rates;
for example, both the exchange rate and unemployment increased in
Mexico during the 1994 crisis, and the 1997 Asian crisis
in South Korea led to higher unemployment and inflation. Turkey
has experienced several major crises since the establishment of the
Republic (1929-32, 1958-61, 1978-83, 1998-2001, and 2008), each preceded by
increases in the current account deficit. In years such as
1977, 1987, 1990, 1993, 1997, 2000, and 2008, the external
value of the national currency was not adjusted in response
to persistent inflation, or was even increased, contributing to the
widening current account deficit. Currency shocks have been a primary
trigger of these crises, with the current account deficit and
inflation identified as leading causes. Notably, unemployment replaced inflation as
the central issue during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The
negative impact of exchange rate fluctuations on employment in Turkey
has been empirically demonstrated, as shown in the study by
Demir (2009).
