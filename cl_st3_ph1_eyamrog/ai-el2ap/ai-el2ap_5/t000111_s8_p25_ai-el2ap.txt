Macambira (1998), analyzing the morphosyntactic properties of quem, demonstrates that
it can function as an indefinite interrogative (23), an ordinary
relative pronoun (24), and an indefinite relative (25). Therefore, in
each instance, quem is treated as a distinct element with
specific morphosyntactic features.
