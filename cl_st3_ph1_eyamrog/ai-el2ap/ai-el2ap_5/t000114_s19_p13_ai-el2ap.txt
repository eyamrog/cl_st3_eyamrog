Leaves are erect-patent, oblong-lanceolate, with an acuminate apex. This species
is distinguished by its cylindrically curved capsule, particularly when dry
or empty, and by the presence of a single peristome
with appendiculate tips. In our samples, it was found as
a terricolous species along roadsides; however, it generally occurs as
a rupicolous species in montane areas of the Atlantic Forest.
It has been recorded in the states of Espírito Santo
(ES), Minas Gerais (MG), Rio de Janeiro (RJ), and Rio
Grande do Sul (RS), and is considered cosmopolitan. The species
is classified as Critically Endangered in the state of Espírito
Santo.
