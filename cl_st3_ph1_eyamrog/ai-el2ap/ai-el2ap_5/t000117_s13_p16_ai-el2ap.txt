This section examines the National Education Guidelines and Basic Law
(LDBEN) no. 9.394 of 1996, not primarily as a regulatory
framework for Brazilian education, but as a discursive event that
affirms the perspectives presented in the reports by Edgar Faure
(1973) and Jacques Delors (1998). Particular attention is given to
the scope of the LDBEN, as articulated in Title I,
Of Education, Article 1, which defines education as encompassing formative
processes that occur within family life, social interactions, the workplace,
educational and research institutions, social movements, civil society organizations, and
cultural manifestations (Brasil, 1996).
