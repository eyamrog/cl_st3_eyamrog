A univariate exploratory analysis of spatial data was conducted to
assess the global spatial autocorrelation of femicide rates in the
municipalities of Sergipe using the Moran I index, based on
the assumptions of normality and randomization. The Moran I index
ranges from -1.0 to +1.0 and evaluates whether spatially adjacent
areas exhibit greater similarity in femicide rates than would be
expected under a random distribution. Spatial autocorrelation, as measured by
the Moran I index, can be classified as positive, negative,
or absent, indicating the degree to which similar values cluster
in space.
