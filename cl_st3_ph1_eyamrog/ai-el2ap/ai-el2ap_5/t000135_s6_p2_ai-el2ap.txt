Emerging countries such as Brazil continue to experience an epidemiological
transition driven by population aging and characterized by a triple
burden of disease, which includes acute health conditions (such as
infectious diseases), external causes, and chronic health conditions that require
ongoing care, all of which necessitate a robust primary health
care (PHC) system. However, PHC services in Brazil remain predominantly
oriented toward the management of acute conditions and are generally
ineffective in addressing health conditions that require continuous and coordinated
care.
