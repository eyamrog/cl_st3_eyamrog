Further research is required to assess the impact of COVID-19
on Brazilian education, specifically regarding processes, perspectives, and scenarios across
all levels of instruction. The right to higher education, whether
delivered in-person or online, should be more prominently recognized within
public discourse to inform and influence policy decisions. This recognition
necessitates a reconsideration of the role and structure of government,
given that education can significantly affect the lives of marginalized
populations. Additionally, public policies should address the need to expand
access to public higher education institutions and to increase the
availability of financial support for students attending private institutions.
