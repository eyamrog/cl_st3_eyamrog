The leaf apex exhibits an involute margin, with leaves that
are oblong-lanceolate and possess a dentate margin; leaf cells are
quadrate to hexagonal, smooth, and the costae are percurrent. In
transverse section, lamellae are present on both the costae and
the lamina. According to Peralta and Yano (2010), this species
is similar to Pogonatum campylocarpum (Müll. Hal.) Mitt., but can
be distinguished by its simple and rhombic lamellae apical cell.
It is terricolous, occurring in the Atlantic Forest (montane and
high fields), and has been recorded in the states of
Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Paraná, Rio de Janeiro, and São
Paulo. The species is considered vulnerable in Espírito Santo and
is endemic to Brazil.
