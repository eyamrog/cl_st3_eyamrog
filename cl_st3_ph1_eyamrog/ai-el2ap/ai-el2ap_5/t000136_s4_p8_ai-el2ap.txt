Due to the temporary nature of projects and the resulting
short-term contractual relationships, which contrast with the typically longer-term planning
horizons of nonprofit organizations (NPOs), it is advisable for NPOs
to reduce their dependence on individual donors. This can be
achieved by diversifying funding sources and increasing the proportion of
unrestricted donations that are not tied to specific projects, thereby
enabling sustained efforts toward ongoing organizational objectives. Consequently, NPOs should
adopt management practices based on their demonstrated effectiveness and relevance
to organizational goals, rather than solely in response to donor
requirements.
