Of the 27 identified species, 14 were present in all
groups during both sampling periods. Acaulospora alpina and Glomus aggregatum
were not detected in the first sampling period, indicating a
possible preference for sporulation during the dry season. Overall species
richness showed a reduction by six species (species 2, 11,
14, 20, 26, and 27) between sampling periods. This pattern
may be attributable to reduced sporulation activity in the dry
season; however, the limited number of sample plots in this
study constrains the robustness of this interpretation. Increasing the number
of sample plots in future research could enhance the reliability
of these findings. Further studies investigating arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)
diversity in disturbed soils with varying gravimetric moisture and organic
matter content throughout the year may help identify species most
sensitive to these environmental variables.
