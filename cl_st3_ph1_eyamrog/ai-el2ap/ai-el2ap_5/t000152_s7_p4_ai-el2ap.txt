In accordance with World Health Organization recommendations, Brazil’s Ministry of
Health implemented social isolation measures, and the Ministry of Education,
through Decree nº 343/2020 (Federative Republic of Brazil 2020c), suspended
in-person classes across the education system while authorizing the use
of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to maintain academic activities.
This approach was consistent with policies adopted in other large
countries, such as China (Zhu and Liu 2020; Daniel 2020).
As a result, 182,600 educational institutions suspended on-site classes, affecting
approximately 47 million Brazilian students at the primary, secondary, and
tertiary levels. Similar to the experience of 850 million students
in 191 countries, these students were required to adapt to
remote learning modalities or, in some cases, the absence of
formal instruction (Mustafa 2020).
