This exploratory ecological study examined the global spatial autocorrelation of
epidemiological factors associated with feminicide rates across 75 municipalities in
the State of Sergipe, Brazil, during the period 2013–2017. The
analysis employed both global and local Moran’s I statistics, as
well as multiple spatial regression models, with exposure variables including
socioeconomic status, demographic characteristics, service availability, health status, and feminicide
rates. Data analysis was conducted using Stata 11.0, SPSS 18.0,
and GeoDa 0.95-i software.
