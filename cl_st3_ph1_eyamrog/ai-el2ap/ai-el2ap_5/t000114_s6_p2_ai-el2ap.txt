The composition of bryoflora observed in this study was found
to be more closely related to that of the Cerrado
and the Amazon Forest. Although the Cerrado is geographically closer
to the Atlantic Forest, the Amazon Forest is the second
richest biome in Brazil (Costa & Peralta 2015; Flora do
Brasil 2020, 2021) and exhibits significant floristic affinity with the
Atlantic Forest, likely due to their shared evolutionary history. Many
of the taxa identified in this study, excluding those that
are endemic, are distributed in both the Cerrado and the
Amazon Forest. These findings are consistent with previous studies conducted
in the region, such as Sousa & Faria (2016) and
Faria et al. (2020).
