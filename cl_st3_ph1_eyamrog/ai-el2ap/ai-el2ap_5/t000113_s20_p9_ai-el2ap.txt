Gender is a social construct that shapes societal perceptions (Abad
et al., 2020). Social practices and relationships contribute to the
formation of male and female identities, which are influenced by
power dynamics that often characterize female identity as fragile, insecure,
emotional, and selfless. Gender stereotypes serve as obstacles to the
advancement of women in society and contribute to the perpetuation
of legitimizing myths, such as the recurrent recognition of male
achievement at the expense of female accomplishment. This pattern is
particularly evident in the cultures of American countries.
