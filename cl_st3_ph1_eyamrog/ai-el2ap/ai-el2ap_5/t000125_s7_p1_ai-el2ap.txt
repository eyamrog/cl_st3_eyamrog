Academic international rankings have attracted increasing attention from scholars, students,
and the general public in recent years (Eccles, 2002; Calderón,
França, & Gonçalves, 2017; Calderón & França, 2018a, 2018b; Dill
& Soo, 2005; Ganga-Contreras et al., 2020). These rankings first
emerged at the beginning of the 21st century. Although their
results are frequently subject to debate, most academic institutions worldwide
seek to improve their positions and often publicize favorable outcomes
extensively.
