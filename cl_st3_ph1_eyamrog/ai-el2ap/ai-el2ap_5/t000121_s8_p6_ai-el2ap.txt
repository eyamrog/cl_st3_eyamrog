The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has generated significant levels of fear,
uncertainty, and concern, highlighting the necessity for a timely assessment
of its effects on individualsâ€™ health status and psychological adjustment.
In Brazil, for example, there is a lack of data
regarding the psychological impact and mental health of the general
population during the initial phase of the COVID-19 epidemic, specifically
in March 2020 (Duarte, Santo, Lima, Giordani, & Trentini, in
press). This gap in knowledge is particularly important given the
unprecedented scale of the outbreak, underscoring the need to understand
its impact on mental health at the onset of social
isolation and quarantine measures. Collecting information from this early period
may facilitate the development of more effective preventive strategies and
improve the organization of health care responses throughout the crisis.
