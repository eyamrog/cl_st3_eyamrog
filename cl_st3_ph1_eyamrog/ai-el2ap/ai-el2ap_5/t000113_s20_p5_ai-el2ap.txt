Freitas and Perez (2016) define camouflaging factors as characteristics that
contribute to the “invisibility” or “non-existence” of certain students, which
can negatively impact their identification, referral, and participation in AEE
(Atendimento Educacional Especializado) classrooms. The authors identify three categories of
camouflaging factors: individual (e.g., low self-esteem, depression, perfectionism), familial (e.g.,
low parental expectations, excessive academic pressure, family conflicts), and environmental
(e.g., low teacher expectations, pejorative labels such as “nerd”). These
factors contribute to the under-representation and underachievement of D&T (Double
Exceptionality and Talent) students by inhibiting the expression of their
abilities and reducing their visibility to educators. As a result,
these students’ indicators of D&T are often overlooked by teachers
(Freitas & Perez, 2016). The issue of invisibility is further
exacerbated among female and Black D&T students, who experience additional
layers of under-recognition.
