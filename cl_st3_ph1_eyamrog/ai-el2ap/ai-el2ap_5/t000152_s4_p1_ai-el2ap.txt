The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed significant challenges that jeopardize both
access to and retention in Brazilian higher education. Instability in
the labor market, increased unemployment, and ongoing uncertainties regarding future
employment prospects have adversely affected studentsâ€™ motivation and capacity to
continue their studies. Public higher education institutions, in particular, frequently
lack sufficient technological infrastructure to effectively support faculty in the
delivery of online courses. Additionally, many instructors report insufficient preparation
for utilizing technological resources, digital platforms, and virtual learning environments.
