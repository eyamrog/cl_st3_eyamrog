Of the 27 federative units, only 18 issued formal reopening
documents that were based on epidemiological and health indicators. The
Federal District, Goiás, Paraná, Roraima, and Tocantins did not formalize
official plans for the resumption of economic activities. Although Bahia,
Pernambuco, Amapá, and Maranhão have government plans to relax social
isolation measures, these were excluded from the analysis because they
are limited to the municipal level and lack clearly defined
indicators.
