In many regions, research excellence is often equated with publication
in English-language journals. This presents particular challenges for fields such
as the Social Sciences, Humanities, and Public and Collective Health,
which frequently address topics of national or regional relevance. Publishing
in English and in high-prestige journals is associated with increased
citation rates and greater impact compared to publication in other
languages.[3] However, data from SciELO CI indicate that Brazilian research
receives a substantial number of citations even when published in
Portuguese (Fig. 2B) or Spanish (Fig. 1B). This regional impact
is significant and should be considered by science policymakers. A
comprehensive understanding of citation dynamics and the role of native-language
publications can inform the development of more equitable and responsible
scientific policies that recognize and support research conducted in local
languages.
