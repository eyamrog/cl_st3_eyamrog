We report the occurrence of 59 moss species representing 38
genera and 22 families (Table 1). Nine species are newly
recorded for the state, including Physcomitrium falcifolium Müll. Hal. ex
Broth and Atractylocarpus brasiliensis (Müll.Hal.) R.S. Williams, which are classified
as Vulnerable and Endangered, respectively, in the most recent Brazilian
red list (Martinelli & Moraes 2013). According to the Espírito
Santo red list (Fraga et al. 2019), Brittonodoxa lithophila (Hornsch.)
W.R. Buck, P.E.A.S.Câmara & Carv.-Silva, Itatiella ulei (Broth. ex Müll.
Hal.) G.L.Sm. (Yano & Peralta 2007, Fraga et al. 2019),
and Schizymenium campylocarpum (Hook. & W.-Arn.) Shaw are classified as
Vulnerable, Vulnerable, and Critically Endangered, respectively. The families with the
highest species richness were Sematophyllaceae (8 species), Leucobryaceae (6 species),
and both Polytrichaceae and Bryaceae (5 species each) (Figure 2).
Approximately 53% of the species are restricted to the Atlantic
Forest, while the remaining species are primarily associated with the
Cerrado (37%) and Amazon Forest (35%). In terms of global
distribution, 31% of the species are neotropical, 15% pantropical, 15%
cosmopolitan, 24% endemic to Brazil, and 15% exhibit disjunct distributions.
The majority of specimens were found on terricolous substrates (47%),
followed by rupicolous substrates (28%) (Figure 3).
