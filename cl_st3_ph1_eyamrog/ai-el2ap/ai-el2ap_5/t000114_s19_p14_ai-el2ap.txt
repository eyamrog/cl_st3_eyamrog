Leaves are planar, lanceolate to falcate, with a long acuminate
apex and serrate margins in the apical region bearing simple
teeth. The specimens examined were collected from rocks in close
proximity to streams, occasionally found submerged, and generally occur as
terricolous in the Atlantic Forest (submontane and montane) within the
states of Espírito Santo, Paraná, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande
do Sul, and São Paulo. This species is endemic to
Brazil.
