Although such amounts may appear de minimis from a legal
perspective and therefore not worth pursuing, we align with the
findings of Eli MacLaren’s study on Canadian poets’ income, which
reported that royalty payments constituted only two percent of their
income, yet many poets emphasized the significance of the validation
provided by even minimal financial compensation (MacLaren, 2017, p. 20).
Our three-step syllabus rule is designed to offer both recognition
to poets and acknowledgment to academics. While the current annual
fee of $1.40 per student has the potential to increase
over time, it remains substantially lower than the $26.00 per
student fee that Access Copyright is presently seeking from the
Canadian Copyright Board (Copyright Board, 2017).
