Tetrasporophyte plant thalli of B. binderi (3 cm in primary
axis length with lateral branches, weighing 200 mg ± 20,
n = 5 per treatment) were initially washed with distilled
water and then immersed in a 5% (w/w) sulfonic acid-based
liquid detergent solution for 60 seconds, following the protocol described
by Fernandes et al. (2011) and Saminathan et al. (2014).
After detergent treatment, the thalli were thoroughly rinsed with sterilized
seawater to ensure complete removal of detergent residues. Subsequently, the
thalli were subjected to disinfection by immersion in 1% povidone
iodine (POVIDINE®) for varying durations: 15 seconds (treatment 1), 30
seconds (treatment 2), 1 minute (treatment 3), and 2 minutes
(treatment 4), as described by Saminathan et al. (2014) and
Ali et al. (2018). Additional thalli were immersed in sodium
hypochlorite solution (0.2% active chlorine in deionized water) for 1
minute (treatment 5), 2 minutes (treatment 6), and 5 minutes
(treatment 7), following Holdt et al. (2014). After chemical treatments,
all thalli were again rinsed several times with sterilized seawater
to remove any residual disinfectant. A control group (n =
5) consisted of thalli that were not washed with distilled
water or exposed to any of the tested chemical treatments.
