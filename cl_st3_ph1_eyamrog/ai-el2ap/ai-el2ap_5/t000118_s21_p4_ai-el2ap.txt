Costa et al. (2015) reported that, based on morphological character
analysis, Vriesea sceptrum Mez and Vriesea altodaserrae L.B. Sm. are
members of the same clade, which also includes basal lineages
of Vriesea species. These species are characterized by compound inflorescences,
bracts that are longer than the peduncle of the branches,
erect and linear to narrowly oblong petals with appressed apices,
and included stamens, as described in detail below.
