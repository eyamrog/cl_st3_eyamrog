Further research is necessary to comprehensively assess the full range
of costs and benefits associated with nonprofit organization (NPO) governance.
While the present study demonstrates a positive association between improved
governance and increased donations, it does not address whether enhanced
governance leads to greater organizational effectiveness. Despite the inherent challenges,
it is crucial to evaluate the extent to which an
NPO fulfills its institutional mission of serving its target community,
as well as to identify additional factors beyond governance that
may contribute to the achievement of its objectives.
