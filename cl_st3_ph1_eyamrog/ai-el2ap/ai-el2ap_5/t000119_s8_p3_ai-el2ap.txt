Plant propagation under varying levels of simulated saline stress has
been investigated by several researchers; however, there is limited information
available regarding the effects of salinity on the seed germination
of common rue (Ruta graveolens L.). Common rue, a member
of the Rutaceae family, is typically propagated by seeds and
is widely used for medicinal purposes due to its content
of secondary metabolites, including flavonoids, coumarins, organic acids, terpenoids, lactones,
and various classes of alkaloids (Ratheesh et al., 2009). Among
these compounds, the flavonoid rutin, which is present in the
leaves, has been reported to possess antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory
properties (Benazir et al., 2011).
