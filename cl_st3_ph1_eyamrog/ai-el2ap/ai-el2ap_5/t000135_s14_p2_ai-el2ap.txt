The outcomes of this study included the rates of medical
procedures recorded in the Outpatient Information System (SIA-SUS; http://sia.datasus.gov.br/principal/index.php). Procedures
were classified into three categories: (a) medical appointments, which included
home visits and appointments in Primary Health Care; (b) prenatal
procedures, encompassing partner prenatal appointments, prenatal and puerperal appointments, rapid
tests for HIV and syphilis detection in expectant mothers or
their partners, and rapid pregnancy tests; and (c) diabetes care,
which included diabetes treatment, diabetic foot examinations, and urine glucose
testing. The total number of procedures across these categories was
also calculated. The absolute number of procedures per 10,000 inhabitants
was determined monthly from February to December for the years
2018, 2019, and 2020 for each group. Population estimates for
2019 were obtained from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and
Statistics (IBGE; http://www.ibge.gov.br).
