The results of this study indicate a highly uneven distribution
of femicide rates per 100,000 women across the municipalities of
Sergipe during the study period, with standardized rates ranging from
11.74 to 87.80 deaths per 100,000 women (Figure 1). To
account for differences in the sex distribution of the population
and to minimize potential confounding effects on femicide rates, the
direct method of rate standardization was applied. This approach was
necessary given the possibility of variations in the female-to-male population
ratio among municipalities. Additionally, the use of deaths from aggression
among women as a proxy variable for femicide may have
led to an overestimation of the phenomenon. However, it is
important to note that an estimated 24% underreporting of deaths
exists in the Northeast region of Brazil, which may partially
offset the potential overestimation or misclassification of deaths due to
female aggression.
