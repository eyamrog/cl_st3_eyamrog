This test, introduced by Banerjee, Arčabić, and Lee (2017), is
a cointegration test extended with Fourier terms that accounts for
the lagged structures of both the dependent and independent variables.
The test is conceptually grounded in the error correction framework.
As shown in Equations 34 and 35, it incorporates constant
and trend terms, the lagged value of the independent variable,
and its level from the previous period.
