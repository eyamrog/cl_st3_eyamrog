The emergence of the novel human coronavirus has resulted in
the declaration of the sixth Public Health Emergency of International
Concern (PHEIC) (PAHO & WHO, 2020). To date, seven coronaviruses
are known to infect humans, with three—SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the
current SARS-CoV-2—capable of causing severe respiratory tract infections (PAHO &
WHO, 2020). As of November 2, 2020, COVID-19, caused by
SARS-CoV-2, was associated with over 1.2 million deaths globally. In
response, countries have implemented isolation and social distancing measures to
limit transmission and control the spread of the virus, while
research into effective prevention and treatment strategies continues (Faro et
al., 2020; PAHO & WHO, 2020).
