The objective of educational systems in the twenty-first century is
to prioritize knowledge construction within a context characterized by an
extensive and readily accessible flow of information. In this environment,
the teacher's role should shift from that of a simple
transmitter of knowledge to that of a facilitator of learning.
The learning process is not confined to formal educational institutions
but extends beyond the boundaries of schools, occurring in a
variety of informal settings and facilitated by connections within global
networks (Coutinho & Lisb√¥a, 2011, p. 10).
