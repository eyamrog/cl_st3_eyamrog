Law 11,206/2005, proposed in 2004, established ProUni and mandated the
implementation of a semiannual selection process; however, it does not
explicitly address distance education. Although some sources suggest that ProUni
scholarships are available for distance education programs, candidates do not
encounter this option during the registration process. Segenreich (2009) reports
that, while the possibility of extending ProUni to distance education
was considered in 2006, by 2009 only six institutions from
other states offered ProUni-supported distance education programs in the state
of Pará. Information from other sources remains inconsistent and unclear.
Furthermore, the Brazilian Ministry of Education’s website does not provide
data disaggregated by teaching modality. Among students who self-finance their
education, 22% indicated that financial constraints might lead them to
discontinue their studies, and 60% identified changes in labor market
conditions due to the pandemic as a factor influencing their
decision to persist in higher education (Brazilian Association of Higher
Education Administrators 2020b).
