In this study, following mass treatment of the indigenous population,
no significant reduction was observed in the overall number of
helminth infections; however, geo-helminth infections were no longer detected among
the students evaluated. Given that mass administration of antiparasitic drugs
primarily targets these pathogens, the intervention can be considered effective
in this regard.19,20 Nevertheless, the highest prevalence of parasitic infections
among the indigenous students was attributable to protozoa, and the
frequency of these infections did not decrease after the intervention;
in fact, an increase in infections by E. histolytica/dispar was
observed. Previous studies have similarly reported that protozoa such as
Entamoeba spp. and G. duodenalis are more prevalent in indigenous
children, whereas A. lumbricoides and hookworms are more common in
adults.20 While some intestinal protozoa are non-pathogenic, species such as
E. histolytica, G. duodenalis, and Blastocystis hominis are associated with
diarrhea, malabsorption, and malnutrition.21 These enteroparasites are transmitted via water,
food, or direct person-to-person contact, and may contribute to impaired
school performance and physical development in children.22 The persistence of
these infections underscores the ongoing public health challenge in this
population.
