Femicide is a sociological concept that has contributed to changes
in traditional perceptions, public awareness, scientific research, and policymaking regarding
gender-based violence. The term is employed in political and academic
contexts to specifically address the violent deaths of women, distinguishing
these acts from general homicide, which does not account for
gender-based motivations. The use of the term femicide seeks to
highlight the distinct nature of these crimes, emphasize their gendered
dimension, and promote awareness of their societal implications. The concept
was further developed by Radford and Russell (1992) and Russell
and Harmes (2001), who advanced femicide as a theoretical framework
to challenge and address the structural forms of patriarchal power
that contribute to violence against women.
