Dry weight of seedlings was determined by first measuring the
fresh weight of 10 previously selected normal seedlings for each
of four replicates. The seedlings were then placed in paper
bags and dried in an oven at 60 Â°C for
48 hours, or until a constant weight was achieved. After
drying, the seedlings were weighed using a precision balance with
an accuracy of 0.001 g, and the results were expressed
in milligrams (mg), following the methodology described by Nakagawa (1999).
