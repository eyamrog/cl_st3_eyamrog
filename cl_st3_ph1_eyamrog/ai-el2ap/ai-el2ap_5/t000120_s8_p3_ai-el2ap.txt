The uppermost layer of forest soil, known as the serapillera
or forest blanket, is a complex system composed of plant
and animal residues at various stages of decomposition, as well
as living microorganisms (De Souza et al. 2016). The application
of biological methods such as nucleation represents a cost-effective and
efficient approach to promote the restoration or recovery of degraded
areas (Almeida 2016). An increase in the serapillera enhances nutrient
cycling and soil fertility (Primo et al. 2018), and may
facilitate the inoculation of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which interact
with plants to improve nutrient uptake by the root system
(Almeida 2016; House & Bever 2018). Mycorrhizal associations are highly
sensitive to disturbances in vegetation and soil, whether caused by
natural events or anthropogenic activities (Brundrett et al. 1985; House
& Bever 2018). Agricultural practices such as complete removal of
vegetation cover, loss of the arable layer, and intensive soil
disturbance are particularly detrimental to mycorrhizal communities (De Souza et
al. 2017). To better understand the response of secondary forests
to disturbances during succession, particularly those affecting the dynamics of
the serapillera, it is necessary to further investigate the relationships
between shrub-associated mycorrhizae and changes in vegetation cover (Maia et
al. 2015).
