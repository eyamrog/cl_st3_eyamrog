Santos et al.21 reported on the impact of the expansion
of the Family Health Strategy (FHS) in Rio de Janeiro
on hospitalization rates for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC), demonstrating
a correlation between increased FHS coverage and a reduction in
these hospitalization rates before and after the implementation of the
RCAPS. Similarly, a comparative analysis of ACSC hospitalization rates across
national capitals indicated that the municipality of Rio de Janeiro
experienced a more substantial reduction over the past ten years,
with a decrease of approximately 13.4%3.
