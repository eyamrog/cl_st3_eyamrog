Microorganisms at a concentration of 1.5 × 10^8 CFU/mL, corresponding
to McFarland standard 5, were cultured in brain heart infusion
(BHI) broth at 37°C. Five 96-well microdilution plates (ALAMAR®, Diadema,
São Paulo, Brazil) were used for the assays. For each
microorganism, growth was assessed in triplicate at a concentration of
100 mg/mL for both the extract and the decoction, as
well as with a positive control consisting of 0.5% chlorhexidine
alcoholic solution (CP) and a negative control of dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO).
