The current context of income and employment instability has prompted
researchers to re-examine the processes of acquiring and managing student
loan debt. In response to increased risks of loan default,
some private institutions have implemented policies to reduce monthly payments
during the pandemic. Stakeholders, including parents, students, and guardians, have
raised concerns regarding the full tuition charges for remote instruction,
and in one instance, a federal state enacted legislation mandating
a 30% reduction in tuition fees (Law 17208/2020; State of
Ceará 2020). Comparable initiatives in other states have been overturned
by federal courts. Medical students at a private higher education
institution in the State of São Paulo also sought a
reduction in tuition fees through legal action, but the court
ultimately denied their request. According to the Brazilian Association of
Higher Education Administrators (2020b), additional requests for tuition fee reductions
have been submitted but were either rejected by higher education
institutions or have not yet resulted in negotiations.
