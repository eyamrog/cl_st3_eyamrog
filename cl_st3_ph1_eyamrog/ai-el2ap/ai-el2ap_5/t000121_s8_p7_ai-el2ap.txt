This study aimed to examine the associations between meta-worry and
symptoms of anxiety and depression during the initial phase of
the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected in March 2020, coinciding
with the implementation of social isolation and quarantine measures for
suspected and confirmed cases in Brazil. First, the prevalence of
anxiety and depressive symptoms was estimated. Subsequently, the mean meta-worry
score was calculated. Finally, a predictive model was tested to
assess the extent to which meta-worry accounted for the variability
in anxiety and depression symptoms within the population.
