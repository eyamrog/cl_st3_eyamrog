In addition to the increased chlorophyll content observed under shaded
conditions, morphological changes such as higher leaf area (LA) and
specific leaf area (SLA) enhance light interception in shaded environments,
as demonstrated in Mikania plants under I75 (Artru 2018). In
contrast, plants grown under full sunlight (I0) exhibit reduced SLA,
which contributes to protection against and mitigation of damage from
excessive solar radiation (Givnish et al. 2004; Matos et al.
2009; Wentworth et al. 2006). The development of small, dense
leaves in these plants serves as a morphological adaptation to
minimize water loss and protect the photosynthetic apparatus from potential
photo-oxidative damage caused by high solar irradiance (Lima Junior et
al. 2005).
