This study entailed a manual count of the "assigned" or
"required" course readings listed on syllabuses, excluding any "optional" or
"supplementary" materials. Seventeen undergraduate students, some of whom possessed proficiency
in French, were trained to categorize the assigned readings—excluding textbooks
and entire assigned books—into four distinct types, as outlined in
the students’ training materials.
