Laboratory Analysis – Organic matter content was determined using the
muffle furnace method as described by Goldin (1987), with the
following modifications: Ten grams of each soil sample were weighed
into porcelain crucibles and dried in an oven at 90
°C for 24 hours. After drying, the samples were reweighed,
then placed in a muffle furnace and incinerated at 550
°C for one hour. The crucibles containing the residual material
were subsequently weighed to determine the organic matter content based
on the weight loss during incineration.
