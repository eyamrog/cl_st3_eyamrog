Data collection was conducted using a structured and standardized script
developed with Microsoft Office ExcelÂ® version 16.0 and made accessible
via cloud computing. Prior to data collection, training was provided
to ensure consistency in the implementation of the active search
process. Following data extraction, a double-check procedure was performed in
which one author reviewed the records, and a second author
independently verified their accuracy.
