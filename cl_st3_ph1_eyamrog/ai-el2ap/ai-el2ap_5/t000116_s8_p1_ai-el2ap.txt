Primary Health Care (PHC) is the World Health Organization's strategy
to improve access to and quality of health care for
populations. It has been implemented in numerous countries to strengthen
health systems, serving as an effective response to the epidemiological
and demographic transitions observed in these settings. In 2006, Brazil
published the first version of the National Primary Care Policy
(PNAB), marking a significant development by elevating primary care from
a health program to a comprehensive strategy known as the
Family Health Strategy (FHS). The FHS is characterized by team-based
and territory-based continuous care, a strong orientation toward families and
communities, and the formal inclusion of community members as Health
Community Agents within care teams.
