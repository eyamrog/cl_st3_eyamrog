Moran's Local Statistics I (Fig. 3) is a critical component
of the analysis, as it quantifies the statistical significance of
spatial groupings. Based on the Local Indicators of Spatial Association
(LISA), the municipalities of Santa Rosa de Lima and Aquidab√£
exhibit the highest femicide rates. The analysis identified statistically significant
LISA clusters within the study area. The significance of this
indicator during the period under review suggests the presence of
positive spatial autocorrelation in femicide rates among municipalities in the
State of Sergipe.
