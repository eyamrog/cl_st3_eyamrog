In this study, the Board does not consider deliverables resulting
from the monitoring of agents or from agentsâ€™ actions that
do not negatively impact the principal (Jensen and Meckling, 1976;
Harris et al., 2015). Instead, these aspects are classified under
the Management dimension, which encompasses the elements that direct the
activities of the executive team, the Board, the Fiscal Council,
and the General Assembly or Board of Trustees, including Corporate
Identity, the Annual Activity Plan, and relevant Codes and Policies.
