Because hospitalizations typically result from acute illness or the exacerbation
of chronic conditions, and these effects can manifest rapidly, we
did not incorporate a time lag between policy changes and
the observation of outcomes. Results with statistical significance at the
5% level are highlighted. Additionally, logarithmic trend terms were tested
to evaluate potential non-linear trends as identified by the Prais
model. Model selection was based on the Bayesian Information Criterion
(BIC) and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The adequacy of
each model was further assessed through residual analysis. To detect
autocorrelation in the residuals (forecast errors), the Durbin-Watson statistic was
applied. All analyses were conducted using R software, version 3.6.1.
