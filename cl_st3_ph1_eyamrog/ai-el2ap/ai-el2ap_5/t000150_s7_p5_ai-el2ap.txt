In the context of migration, multiple mechanisms operate in a
largely objectified manner. The purpose of this discussion is not
to critique the prevailing dominant models, but rather to examine
the role of the "family" within these frameworks, specifically how
the family functions as a component within explanatory models grounded
in network and transnational theories. When the family is conceptualized
as merely one element within this system, it is important
to consider what aspects may be overlooked or excluded. Conversely,
if the analytical framework is reoriented to prioritize kinship as
a foundational principle, it is necessary to assess what new
insights or dimensions may emerge.
