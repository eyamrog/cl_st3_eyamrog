Lower specific leaf area (SLA) values indicate increased leaf thickness,
which is attributable to thicker parenchyma and epidermis under high
levels of solar irradiance. In Mikania laevigata, leaf thickness was
greater than in Mikania glomerata. This increase in leaf thickness,
primarily due to a thicker adaxial epidermis, may account for
the observed reduction in photoinhibition and the higher photosynthetic rates
in plants grown under I25 conditions. The epidermis attenuates ultraviolet
(UV) radiation and facilitates the diffusion of photosynthetically active radiation
(PAR) into the photosynthetic tissues. For instance, Verdaguer et al.
(2017) reported a thicker adaxial epidermis in plants exposed to
UV-A radiation. The development of a thicker adaxial epidermis, or
hypodermis, appears to function as a protective mechanism for the
palisade parenchyma against excessive visible light and as a safeguard
against leaf wilting under high solar irradiance (Chazdon & Kaufmann
1993). Modifications in leaf structure are essential for plant adaptation
and growth under varying environmental conditions (Hanba et al. 2002;
Schl√ºter et al. 2003). Stomatal density (SD) and stomatal index
(SI) in Mikania leaves were also influenced by solar irradiance
levels. The concurrent increases in SD and SI suggest that
solar irradiance stimulates epidermal cell differentiation into stomata, and that
changes in SD and SI are not attributable to reductions
in the size or number of epidermal cells (Woodward 1987).
The elevated SD and SI in plants with the lowest
retention of solar radiation flux likely resulted in increased stomatal
conductance (gs) and photosynthetic rate (A).
