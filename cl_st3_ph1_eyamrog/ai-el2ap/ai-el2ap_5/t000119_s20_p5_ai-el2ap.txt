Under water deficit conditions, plants experience cell dehydration, which leads
to a reduction in pressure potential (turgor) and cell volume.
This state can result in increased ion concentrations in the
cytosol, reaching cytotoxic levels that may cause protein denaturation and
membrane destabilization, potentially leading to cell death (Taiz et al.
2017). In seeds, water deficit is primarily associated with a
decreased germination percentage, an increased mean germination time, and reduced
growth of the primary root and hypocotyl (DemontiÃªzo et al.
2016; Freire et al. 2018).
