This text is organized into five sections. The first section
examines the concept of the learning society, emphasizing the central
role of information and communication technologies (ICT) in studentsâ€™ learning
processes, particularly within the context of alternative pedagogies. The second
section analyzes the Faure and Delors reports to demonstrate that
both documents had already anticipated the flexibilization of learning spaces
beyond traditional educational institutions. The third section discusses the influence
of these reports on the Brazilian National Education Guidelines and
Basic Law (LDBEN 9.394/1996). The fourth section explores the discourse
surrounding the dematerialization of schooling, situating it within a parallel
discursive framework that includes the reconsideration of childhood and the
concept of schooling in non-traditional environments, such as the forest.
Finally, the fifth section presents an interview with Noah Webster
Sobe, Senior Project Officer of the Research and Foresight program
at UNESCO, to address the processes of deterritorialization and reterritorialization
of schooling, as well as the associated phenomena of dematerialization
and the shifting boundaries of educational spaces, particularly in the
context of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on discourses
regarding learning environments.
