Although the analysis conducted in this study is comprehensive, it
does not encompass internal management processes, specific measures implemented to
address the pandemic, or the shared responsibilities of other governmental
levels in influencing outcomes. Consequently, the present analysis should not
be interpreted as an assessment of the performance of governmental
administrations. Instead, it serves as a reference for evaluating the
objectivity, clarity, and transparency of the recovery plans submitted by
each Brazilian federated unit included in the study.
