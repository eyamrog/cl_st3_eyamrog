Leaves are clustered distally, erect, and range from ovate to
oblate-lanceolate in shape; costae are either shortly excurrent or terminate
in an apiculate apex. The capsule is easily detached and
lacks stomata. This species is similar to Crumuscus vitalis Bück
& Snider but can be distinguished by the presence of
julaceous sterile shoots (Schäfer-Verwimp 1996). The specimens examined were collected
in high-altitude fields, occurring as rupicolous in the Atlantic Forest
from montane to high montane regions, and have been recorded
in the states of Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Paraná, Rio
de Janeiro, and Santa Catarina; it is endemic to Brazil.
