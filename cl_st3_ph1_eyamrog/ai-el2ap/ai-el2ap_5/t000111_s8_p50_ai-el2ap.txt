In the domain of semantics, free relatives are characterized as
exhibiting maximalizing content (Grosu & Landman, 1998). Specifically, free relatives
that employ a realis verb form are analyzed as containing
a semantically CP-internal head, along with external material to the
CP, which is realized as a phonologically null pro. In
this configuration, the interpretation of the external material is entirely
determined by the semantic content of the CP (Grosu &
Landman, 1998, p. 158). Consequently, the semantics of such sentences
necessarily yield a maximal, preferably universal, interpretation, in contrast to
interrogative or cleft constructions, which are associated with a definite
reading.
