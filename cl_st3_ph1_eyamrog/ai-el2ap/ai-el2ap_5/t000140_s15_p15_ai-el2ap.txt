There is some overlap between textbooks and readings on the
syllabuses, with 361 syllabuses (10.6 percent of the total) requiring
students to purchase a textbook while also assigning at least
one additional required reading. When a complete trade book—such as
a novel, play, or nonfiction work—was assigned in its entirety
rather than as selected chapters or excerpts, it was excluded
from our calculations. This exclusion is based on the rationale
that the purchase of a trade book directly compensates publishers
and authors, and therefore, such transactions do not need to
be included in the tariff calculations for assigned readings.
