The extensive English-language literature demonstrates that abortion providers frequently experience
fear regarding the potential negative consequences of disclosing their involvement
in abortion services. Documented consequences include professional discredit and workplace
mistreatment by colleagues who oppose abortion. Providers also report significant
psychosocial burdens, including stress and both physical and emotional fatigue,
associated with their roles in providing abortion care. A consistent
analytical focus across these studies is the identification of adverse
personal and professional impacts on healthcare team members involved in
abortion services (Martin, Debbink, Hassinger, Youatt, 2014; Martin, Debbink, Hassinger,
Youatt, Eagen-Torkko, Harris, 2014; Norris, Steinberg, Kavanaugh, De Zordo, Becker,
2011; Harris, Debbink, Martin, Hassinger, 2011; O’Donnell, Weitz, Freedman, 2011).
In contrast, research on abortion stigma in Latin America remains
limited (Zamberlin, 2015; Adesse, Bonnan, Silveira, Matos, 2016). Over the
past decade, studies have increasingly examined the effects of stigma
on women undergoing abortions in legally restrictive contexts (Palomino, Ramos,
Davey, Guzmán, Carda, Bayer, 2011; Galli, Sydow, 2010; Shellenberg, Moore,
Bankole, Juarez, Omideyi, Palomino, Zathar, Shingh, Tsui, 2011; Vallejo, Botina,
Gómez, 2016), while other research has addressed the impact of
stigmatizing attitudes on healthcare professionals (De Zordo, 2012; Faúndes, Alves,
Duarte, 2013; Vivas, Valencia, González, 2016).
