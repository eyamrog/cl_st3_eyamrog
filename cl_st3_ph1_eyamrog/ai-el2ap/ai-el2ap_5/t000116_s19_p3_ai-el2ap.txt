The measures presented correspond to point estimates and provide preliminary
indications for describing trends. A visual inspection of the temporal
trends across the three study periods was conducted (Figure 2).
The time-series illustration indicates a slight increase in the trend
during the first period, followed by a reduction during the
RCAPS period, and continued reduction during the PNAB period, although
with a change in the rate level. RCAPS was associated
with a reduction in rates for most groups. In contrast,
the implementation of PNAB was associated with a change in
the previous trend, suggesting that, for certain causes, the introduction
of PNAB altered the patterns of detection and treatment.
