The discussion is based on the hypothesis that, ceteris paribus,
non-profit organizations (NPOs) with higher levels of governance receive greater
amounts of donations. Previous research has examined the potential impact
of specific governance factors, such as board size, or broader
governance dimensions, such as disclosure, which are typically measured using
sets of observable variables, for example, the presence of an
annual report. Harris et al. (2015), for instance, identified seven
governance dimensions through factor analysis—board, management, policies, access, audit, executive
compensation, and minutes—and found that donations and government grants are
positively associated with six of these dimensions, with the exception
of minutes, which showed no significant effect.
