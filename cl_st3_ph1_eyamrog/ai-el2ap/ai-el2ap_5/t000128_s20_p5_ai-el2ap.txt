The results indicate that the hydroalcoholic extract exhibited greater efficacy
than the decoction, as evidenced by lower absorbance values after
24 hours and inhibition of the development and growth of
microorganisms such as P. aeruginosa and Salmonella Typhimurium. Comparison of
the results between the tested microorganisms revealed a lower bacterial
load, with statistically significant differences observed.
