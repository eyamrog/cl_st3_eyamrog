Item II of Article 1 states that "school education should
be linked to the world of labor and social practice"
(Brasil, 1996), establishing a guideline that emphasizes the integration of
education with practical and social contexts, particularly those related to
the workforce. Article 32 of the LDBEN, specifically section III
on basic education and items I, III, and IV, outlines
the objectives of basic education for citizenship. Item I specifies
that a primary goal of basic education is the "understanding
of the natural and social environments, of the political system,
of technology, of the arts and of the values on
which society is based" (Brasil, 1996), indicating that basic education
should facilitate comprehensive understanding of societal structures and technological advancements.
Item III addresses the development of learning capacity, focusing on
the acquisition of knowledge and skills as well as the
formation of attitudes and values (Brasil, 1996).
