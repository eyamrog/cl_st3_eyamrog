International Orientation (orange) is the fourth dimension examined in detail
in this study. It comprises six indicators, of which only
International Joint Publications is derived from open sources; the remaining
five—Foreign Language Bachelor Programmes, Foreign Language Master Programmes, Student Mobility,
International Academic Staff, and International Doctorate Degrees—are based on data
provided by the institutions themselves. Twelve institutions have data available
for only one indicator, specifically International Joint Publications, indicating that
there is significant potential for improvement in this dimension through
enhanced data reporting. Four universities—Unesp, University of São Paulo, State
University of Campinas, and State University of Maringá—have reported data
for all six indicators, suggesting a concerted effort to improve
their standing in the ranking by providing comprehensive information. Among
all institutions, only the Federal University of Ceará received an
A grade in this dimension, while the University of São
Paulo and the State University of Campinas each received a
B grade, representing the next highest performance levels.
