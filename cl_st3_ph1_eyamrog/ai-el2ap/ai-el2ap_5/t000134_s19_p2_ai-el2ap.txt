The cumulative species curve for amphibians reached an asymptote after
213 hours of sampling, with a total observed richness of
22 species, whereas the curve for reptiles reached an asymptote
after 276 hours, with a total of 14 species, based
on a total sampling effort of 460 hours (Figure 8).
The confidence intervals of the rarefaction curves converged to zero
for amphibians, indicating a high level of sampling completeness, while
for reptiles, the error remained at an estimated 2.3 species
(Figure 8). The species richness estimated using the Bootstrap procedure
was consistent with the values recorded by the Visual Encounter
Survey (VES) method for both amphibians (estimated richness = 22.4
species) and reptiles (estimated richness = 15.6 species).
