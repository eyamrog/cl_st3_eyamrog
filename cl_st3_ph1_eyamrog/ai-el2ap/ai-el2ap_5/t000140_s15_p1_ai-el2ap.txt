Using web-scraping methods designed to collect course syllabuses from Canadian
universities, we obtained 5,898 documents from institutions across nine of
Canada’s ten provinces (Table 1). Of these, 3,916 were identified
as unique syllabuses from the period 2015–2020. We excluded 525
syllabuses that referenced assigned readings without specifying them, as these
materials were only available in coursepacks or on external websites.
This process resulted in a final dataset of 3,391 syllabuses,
of which 2,800 included lists of required readings and/or textbooks.
The remaining 591 syllabuses did not specify any required or
assigned materials, although some of these courses provided optional or
recommended resources for students.
