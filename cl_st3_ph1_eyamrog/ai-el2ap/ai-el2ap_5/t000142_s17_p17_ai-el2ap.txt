Equation (7) specifies the model as follows: 𝛥𝑦𝑡 = 𝜆1𝛥𝑦𝑡−1
+ 𝜆2(𝛥𝑦𝑡−1)^2 + 𝜆3(𝛥𝑦𝑡−1)^3 + ∑_{j=1}^{p} 𝜆4,𝑗𝛥𝑦𝑡−𝑗 + 𝜀𝑡, where
𝛥𝑦𝑡 denotes the first difference of the variable of interest
at time t, 𝜆1, 𝜆2, and 𝜆3 are coefficients associated
with the linear, quadratic, and cubic terms of the lagged
first difference, respectively, 𝜆4,𝑗 represents the coefficients for additional lagged
differences up to order p, and 𝜀𝑡 is the error
term.
