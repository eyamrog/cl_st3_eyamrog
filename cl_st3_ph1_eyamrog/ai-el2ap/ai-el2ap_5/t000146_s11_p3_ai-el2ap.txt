Velez-Cuartas, Lucio-Arias, and Leydesdorff [16] conducted a comparative analysis of
the visibility of Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) publications in
the Web of Science (WoS) and SciELO databases to assess
the dissemination of scientific knowledge in the region. Their findings
indicate that LAC scientific communications are predominantly written in Spanish
and Portuguese, a trend attributable to the linguistic composition of
the region and the geographical distribution of research collaborators. Collaborations
within LAC are often influenced by partnerships with researchers from
developed countries, particularly in Europe. Notably, LAC researchers serve as
first authors in approximately two-thirds of multi-authored papers, suggesting substantial
integration into global scientific networks. Analysis of LAC scientific publications
indexed in WoS and available in Open Access (AA) reveals
that the majority are published in English (70.37%), with Portuguese
(17.86%) and Spanish (11.63%) following; other languages, such as French,
Italian, and German, constitute only 0.19% [17]. When compared to
the overall language distribution of LAC publications indexed in WoS,
the proportions of Spanish and especially Portuguese are higher in
the AA subset (11.63% and 17.86%, respectively, versus 7.40% and
7.44%), while the proportion of English is lower (70.37% versus
84.96%). In contrast, publications indexed in SciELO CI are primarily
in Spanish (39.60%), followed by Portuguese (33.30%) and English (27.07%),
with other languages representing only 0.03% [17].
