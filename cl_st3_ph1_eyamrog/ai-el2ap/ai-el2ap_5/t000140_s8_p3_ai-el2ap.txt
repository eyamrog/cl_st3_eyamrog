These developments have introduced a financial conflict in the distribution
of course readings. For example, a 2013 study conducted by
one of the present authors found that 45.1 percent of
the readings purchased by students in 110 course packs at
Stanford University and Queen’s University were already freely available to
them through their respective libraries or via open access (Evans
and Willinsky, 2013). Similarly, a 2017 study of 12 courses
at the University of Toronto identified a “double-charging” issue, as
55 percent of the assigned readings were already licensed by
the library and fully accessible in electronic form (Cancilla, Glushko,
Orfano & Slaght, 2017). In such cases, students pay royalty
fees for course readings that the library has already licensed
on a campus-wide basis, typically funded through student tuition fees.
The present study provides a large-scale update on this issue
by analyzing 3,391 Canadian university syllabi from 34 institutions, and
demonstrates that double-charging may affect over 90 percent of assigned
readings. By differentiating between academic and trade publications, the study
proposes a resolution for all stakeholders through a “three-step syllabus
rule.” Additionally, the findings are intended to inform ongoing legal
cases in Canada and the United States regarding university practices
in the provision of course readings.
