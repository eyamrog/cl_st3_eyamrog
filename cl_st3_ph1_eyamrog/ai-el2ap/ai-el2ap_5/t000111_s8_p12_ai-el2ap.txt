Cunha and Cintra (2008) propose that appositive phrases possess a
nominal nature, are coreferential with the noun to which they
relate, and are juxtaposed. However, Cunha and Cintra note that
appositive constructions cannot have an adjectival nature, as they form
a unit that refers to the same entity as the
related noun without characterizing it (p. 174). The following section
examines sentential appositives, focusing on their structure and function.
