The proportions of herbs, shrubs, and trees were quantified. For
each sampling site, the richness and representativeness of plant families
were calculated based on the total number of species recorded.
The identification of species with toxic potential was analyzed in
relation to their biogeographic origin. The Sörensen Similarity Index (IS)
was applied to assess the degree of similarity between two
sites based on species presence or absence (Sörensen 1948). Fieldwork
included direct observations and guided walks with local producers, which
provided additional data on spontaneous forage resources. This information was
supplemented with bibliographic sources and preliminary results from microhistological analysis
of fecal samples.
