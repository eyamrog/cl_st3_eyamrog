The text begins by discussing the characteristics of students with
D&T in Brazilian schools and the challenges related to their
inadequate identification and referral processes, which constitute the first form
of invisibility. This lack of recognition affects the perceptions of
school administrators, peers, parents, guardians, and teachers. Subsequently, the discussion
addresses the characteristics of female education during the colonial period,
highlighting a range of historical and contemporary processes, including inequality,
stigmatization, injustice, social exclusion, racism, and violence, which collectively impact
this segment of the Brazilian population and represent a second
form of invisibility. Finally, drawing on Social Domain Theory (TDS),
the analysis examines a third dimension of invisibility, specifically focusing
on the education of Black women.
