It is possible to omit the first element of the
apposition in (3a), but not in (4a); similarly, the positions
of the nominal and the subordinate clause can be switched
in (3b), but this is not possible in (4b). Additionally,
the wh-sentence can be extraposed in (3c), whereas extraposition of
the appositive clause is not permitted in (4c).
