In addition to the social sciences and humanities, the field
of Public and Collective Health also exhibits certain national and
centralized characteristics. Consequently, researchers in this field encounter the ethical
dilemma of whether to publish significant research findings in their
native language to benefit the local community—including professionals, researchers, and
the general public—or to publish in English in order to
increase the accessibility and dissemination of their work to an
international audience.
