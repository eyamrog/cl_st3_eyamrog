Intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) of M. glomerata plants was higher
under the I75 treatment compared to the I0 treatment (Figure
1g). In contrast, M. laevigata plants exhibited the lowest iWUE
values under the I75 treatment relative to other treatments (Figure
1h). Overall, M. laevigata plants demonstrated lower iWUE values than
M. glomerata plants (Supplementary Material Table S2). This difference may
be associated with the higher stomatal conductance (gs) observed in
M. laevigata plants (Figure 1h).
