Lucio-Arias, Velez-Cuartas, and Leydesdorff [13] analyzed 79,924 items from SciELO
and WoS to examine patterns of international cooperation, finding that
publications from Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries are predominantly
in Spanish and Portuguese. According to the authors, the use
of these languages may contribute to the limited participation of
LAC researchers in international collaborative networks. Furthermore, as noted by
Luukkonen, Persson, and Sivertsen [14], there is an inverse relationship
between the strength of a country's scientific infrastructure and its
degree of international collaboration. Consequently, countries such as Haiti, Honduras,
Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic exhibit international collaboration rates above
80%, whereas more research-intensive countries like Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and
Mexico have rates between 30% and 40% [15]. Overall, there
is a general trend among countries to increase their levels
of international collaboration.
