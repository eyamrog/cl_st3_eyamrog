This species is classified within the "pupula" group of Sellaphora
and can be distinguished from Sellaphora pupula (KÃ¼tzing) Mereschkovsky (1902:
187) by its linear elliptical valves with broadly rounded poles
(Mann et al. 2008). It was detected in 35% of
the core samples, with a maximum relative abundance of 6%.
The species was identified in samples dating from the end
of the Mid-Holocene to the present (~6,000 cal. yr BP
to present). This study represents the first documented occurrence of
this species in the Brazilian Amazon.
