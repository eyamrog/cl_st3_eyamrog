In 2013, Access Copyright initiated legal action against York University
for failing to pay the tariff approved by the Copyright
Board of Canada, which covered the reproduction of millions of
copies by York between 2011 and 2013. Access Copyright is
a not-for-profit collective representing approximately 11,000 Canadian writers, visual artists,
and publishers, and it establishes agreements with organizations such as
universities and provincial ministries of education to facilitate royalty payments
for course materials. The Copyright Board of Canada set an
interim annual tariff rate of $14.31 per university student (ACT,
2019). However, due to ongoing uncertainty regarding the application of
fair dealing in educational contexts, approximately one quarter of Canada’s
96 universities have not paid Access Copyright’s tariff (Access Copyright,
2020a). In response to the 2013 lawsuit, York University argued
that its staff adhered to institutional guidelines based on the
“fair dealing” exception in Canada’s Copyright Act, which permit the
provision of a single copy of a short excerpt from
a copyright-protected work to each student enrolled in a course
(“Fair Dealing,” 2012). In 2017, the Federal Court ruled against
York, determining that the Interim Tariff was mandatory and that
York’s Fair Dealing Guidelines did not constitute fair dealing, citing,
among other factors, significant negative impacts on the market (CCLA,
2017, 13, 356, 353). In 2020, the Federal Court of
Appeal found that the tariff was not mandatory, clarifying that
the Copyright Board’s tariff-setting process is intended to protect the
public from excessive pricing (YU, 2020, 206), but it also
upheld the previous finding that York’s guidelines did not guarantee
that the copying qualified as fair dealing (311). The Supreme
Court of Canada has subsequently agreed to hear the case.
