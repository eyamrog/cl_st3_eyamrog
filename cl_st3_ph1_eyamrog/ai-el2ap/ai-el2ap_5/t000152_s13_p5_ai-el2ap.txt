Due to disparities in the quality of teaching between public
and private secondary schools, the ENEM did not ensure equitable
access to or retention in higher education. In response, the
University for All Program (ProUni) was established in 2004 to
provide scholarships covering up to 100% of tuition at private
higher education institutions (Ministry of Education of Brazil 2018b). Additionally,
the Student Financing Fund (FIES) was expanded to increase access
for socially vulnerable students, also offering coverage of up to
100% of tuition costs. Eligibility for funding through ProUni or
FIES was contingent upon participation in the ENEM.
