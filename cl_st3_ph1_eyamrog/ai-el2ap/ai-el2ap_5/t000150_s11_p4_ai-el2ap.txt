Based on Schneider’s critiques, subsequent research on kinship has increasingly
recognized a broader range of relationships—including friendship, companionship, and shared
experiences of suffering—as forms of kinship, although the inclusion of
same-sex relationships as kinship has not always been explicitly addressed.
This perspective highlights the plasticity of kinship relations, emphasizing that
the concept of family represents only a limited subset of
the diverse relationships that can be classified as kinship.
