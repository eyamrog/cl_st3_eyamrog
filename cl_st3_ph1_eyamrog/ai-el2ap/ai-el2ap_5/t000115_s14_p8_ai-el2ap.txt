The parasitological health indicators assessed in this study included the
overall prevalence of enteroparasites, species-specific prevalence, prevalence of polyparasitism, and
prevalence stratified by gender and age group. The intensity of
infection was not measured, as the Kato-Katz quantitative method was
not employed in this study.
