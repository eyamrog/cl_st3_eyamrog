The chemical properties of the two integrated samples (Table 1)
were analyzed based on the criteria established by the Instituto
Agron√¥mico de Campinas (Raij et al., 1997) and Embrapa (Sobral
et al., 2015), taking into account the classification of the
soil as being under perennial cultivation due to the presence
of Urochloa.
