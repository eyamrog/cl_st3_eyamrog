This hypothesis is based on the premise that governance mitigates
agency problems arising from the contractual relationship between the principal
(donor) and the agent (NPO) by implementing mechanisms that address
several key issues, including information asymmetry, divergent utility functions (such
as differing motivations and goals), varying levels of risk aversion,
rational behavior on the part of the agent, differences in
planning horizons, and the absence of a perfect contract (see
Lacruz, 2020). Consequently, governance provides assurance to donors that their
interests will be prioritized in the allocation and use of
resources by the NPO.
