The most distinctive characteristic of this species is the excurrent
costa, which is dorsally ridged and, in cross section, contains
stereids on both sides. Accurate identification of the species requires
the presence of the sporophyte, as it is distinguished from
related taxa by its exothecial oval cells and peristome teeth,
which are split into 2–3 segments for approximately two-thirds of
their length. The specimens examined were collected from rocks near
streams, although the species generally occurs as a terricolous organism
in high montane areas of the Atlantic Forest. It has
been recorded in the Brazilian states of Bahia, Rio de
Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul, and São Paulo. The species
is classified as endangered and is endemic to Brazil.
