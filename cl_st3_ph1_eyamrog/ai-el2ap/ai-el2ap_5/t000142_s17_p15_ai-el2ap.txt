Equation (6) specifies the model as follows: \( y_t =
\beta_0 + \beta_1 y_{t-1} + \beta_2 y_{t-1}^2 + \beta_3 y_{t-1}^3
+ \sum_{j=1}^{p} \beta_{4,j} \Delta y_{t-j} + \varepsilon_t \), where \(
y_t \) denotes the dependent variable at time \( t
\), \( y_{t-1} \), \( y_{t-1}^2 \), and \( y_{t-1}^3
\) represent the first, second, and third powers of the
lagged dependent variable, respectively, and \( \Delta y_{t-j} \) denotes
the first difference of the dependent variable lagged by \(
j \) periods. The coefficients \( \beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3,
\) and \( \beta_{4,j} \) are parameters to be estimated,
\( p \) is the number of lagged differences included
in the model, and \( \varepsilon_t \) is the error
term.
