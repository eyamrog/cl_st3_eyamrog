Stool samples were collected either by parents or guardians, or
by the children and adolescents themselves if they were deemed
capable of understanding and performing the procedure independently, following an
initial meeting between the research team, members of the indigenous
community, and community leaders. During this meeting, the objectives and
potential benefits of the research were explained, and detailed instructions
for proper sample collection were provided. Collection containers, labeled with
participants’ names, were distributed along with both verbal and written
instructions, with assistance from community Indigenous Health Agents (IHAs). In
the days following the meeting, IHAs visited participants’ homes to
retrieve the containers with the collected stool samples. The samples
were then placed in cold coolers without chemical preservatives and
transported to the Clinical Parasitology Laboratory at the State University
of Western Paraná in Cascavel, where they were stored at
5 °C and processed within three days. Throughout transport and
storage, procedures were implemented to preserve the morphology of any
parasites present and to maintain sample integrity.
