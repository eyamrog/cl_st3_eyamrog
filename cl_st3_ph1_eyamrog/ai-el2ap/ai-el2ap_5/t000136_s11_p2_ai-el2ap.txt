Therefore, this study applies the assumptions and concepts of agency
theory to the nonprofit context in order to examine the
conflicts that may arise between principals and agents. Specifically, it
focuses on the agency relationship established when a donor (principal)
engages a nonprofit organization (agent) to transfer donations that are
subject to donor-imposed restrictions.
