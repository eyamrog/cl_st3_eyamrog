Experiments were conducted at the University of São Paulo, Ribeirão
Preto campus (21°10'08.4'' S, 47°51'50.6'' W), São Paulo, Brazil, in
a region characterized by a tropical wet and dry climate
(Aw) according to the Köppen-Geiger classification. Detailed climatic data for
the experimental period are provided in Supplementary Table S1. The
study utilized Mikania glomerata Spreng. and Mikania laevigata Sch. Bip
ex Baker. Plantlets of each species were propagated from cuttings
taken from the middle sections of branches of different parental
plants, with each cutting measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter
and 12 cm in length, containing a node at the
apex and a pair of leaves, following the protocol described
by Lima et al. (2003). The cuttings were initially planted
in 3-kg plastic bags filled with a 1:1 mixture of
manure and red latosol soil and maintained under greenhouse conditions.
After approximately 60 days, once rooting was established, the plantlets
were transplanted into 20 L pots containing soil and subjected
to experimental treatments for 150 days. The soil was supplemented
with 1 g of NPK (4-14-8) fertilizer per kg of
soil. Plants were exposed to four light regimes: full sunlight
(I0), and 25% (I25), 50% (I50), and 75% (I75) reduction
in solar radiation, as illustrated in Supplementary Figure 1. These
light conditions were achieved using specially constructed greenhouses equipped with
artificial shading to provide the desired levels of solar radiation
attenuation. Throughout the experiment, pots were irrigated daily to maintain
soil at field capacity, monitored using an ML2× Theta Probe
sensor (Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK).
