Figure 2 indicates that the direct relationships within the structural
model were statistically significant and exhibited positive effects, as evidenced
by the positive path coefficients. In the second-order hierarchical model,
the Fiscal Council demonstrated a weaker association with Governance, with
a path coefficient of 0.425, compared to other dimensions where
Governance showed similar and higher coefficients ranging from 0.631 to
0.727. This difference may be attributable to the fact that,
under the legal framework applicable to the sampled Brazilian non-profit
organizations (NPOs), the Fiscal Council is not a mandatory body
for either NPOs or companies.
