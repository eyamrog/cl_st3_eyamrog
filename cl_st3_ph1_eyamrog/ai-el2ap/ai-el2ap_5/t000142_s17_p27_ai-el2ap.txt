In the models, St(λ,τ) represents the logistic smooth transition function,
as defined in Equation 11. In this function, τ specifies
the midpoint of the transition, while γ determines the speed
of the transition. For γ > 0, the function satisfies
S_{−∞}(γ, τ) = 0, S_{+∞}(γ, τ) = 1, and S_τ(γ,
τ) = 0.5. A smaller value of γ results in
a slower transition, causing S_τ(γ, τ) to remain within the
interval (0,1) for a longer period. When γ = 0,
S_τ(γ, τ) equals 0.5 for all time points t. Conversely,
a larger γ leads to a more rapid transition, with
S_τ(γ, τ) approaching the (0,1) interval almost instantaneously. As γ
approaches positive infinity, the function shifts from 0 to 1
abruptly at t = τ.
