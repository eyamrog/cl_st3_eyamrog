In conclusion, the structures referred to in this study as
nominal appositive clauses (as exemplified in (15)) and appositive relative
clauses (as illustrated in (16)), while exhibiting semantic similarities, display
significant syntactic differences. These syntactic distinctions are essential for the
analysis of the wh- sentences that constitute the primary focus
of the present paper.
