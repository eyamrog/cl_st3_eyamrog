The authors of this article observed an instance of the
phenomenon described above during interviews conducted as part of a
master's project, which aimed to identify D&T students in a
state school located on the French-Brazilian border. Interviews were conducted
with teachers, parents, and students. In one interview with the
mother of two students (a girl and a boy), the
researchers noted a clear maternal preference for the son. The
mother provided detailed descriptions of her son's abilities, intelligence, and
talents, while her comments about her daughter were brief and
characterized the girl as obstinate but not intelligent. However, analysis
of the interviews revealed that only the daughter exhibited D&T
characteristics. From the researchers' perspective, this finding supports the existence
of a legitimizing myth that contributes to the social construction
of gender differences (Abad, 2018; Abad et al., 2020).
