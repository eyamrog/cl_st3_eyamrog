The first global university ranking to be established was the
Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), also known as the
"Shanghai Ranking," which was introduced in 2003 (Calderón & França,
2018b; http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2020.html). The primary purpose of the ARWU was to
assist the Chinese government in identifying universities for sending Chinese
students abroad and to facilitate the comparison of leading Chinese
universities with top institutions worldwide.
