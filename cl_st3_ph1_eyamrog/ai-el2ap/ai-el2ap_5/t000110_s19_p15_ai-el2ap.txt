The present species exhibits morphological similarities to Placoneis constans (Hustedt)
Cox var. symmetrica (Hustedt) Kobayasi, particularly in valve structure and
rostrate ends. However, P. exigua can be distinguished by its
larger valves and the presence of a central area characterized
by shorter striae surrounded by longer striae (Bartozek et al.
2018). This species was identified in 6% of the core
samples, with a maximum observed abundance of 1.5%. It was
recorded in samples spanning from the end of the Mid-Holocene
to the core top, corresponding to approximately 5,479 calibrated years
before present to the present day.
