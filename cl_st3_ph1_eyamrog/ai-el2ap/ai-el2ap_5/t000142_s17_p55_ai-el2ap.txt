Testing is conducted based on the hypothesis that the coefficient
(δ) of the 𝑦𝑡−1 variable is less than or equal
to zero. Specifically, the null hypothesis posits the absence of
a cointegrating relationship, while the alternative hypothesis suggests the existence
of such a relationship. To evaluate this, the model is
estimated and the statistical significance of the coefficient associated with
𝑦𝑡−1 is tested.
