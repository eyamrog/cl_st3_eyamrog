Vriesea altobocainensis is also related to Vriesea altodaserrae, a species
distributed throughout the Serra do Mar mountain range, from sea
level to the highest elevations in Paraná, Santa Catarina, and
São Paulo, and also occurring in Serra da Bocaina. Both
species are sympatric, with Vriesea altodaserrae being considerably more common
in the region. In contrast, Vriesea altobocainensis is rarer and
typically inhabits the forest canopy, which complicates its detection and
makes population size estimates more challenging. The two species exhibit
similar general morphology, particularly regarding the shape and size of
the rosettes, the predominantly red primary bracts, and the distichous
flowers with yellow sepals and petals. However, Vriesea altobocainensis is
distinguished by its more robust inflorescence branches, which are fewer
in number (10–21), thicker red rachillas, densely aggregated flowers, and
internodes measuring 0.8–1.1 cm in length. Additionally, the primary bracts
in the upper portion of the rachis are orbicular to
broadly ovate and 6–8 cm wide, while the floral bracts
are red or, at the apex of the branch, red
with yellow at the apex, orbicular to broadly ovate, and
2–2.8 cm wide. In contrast, Vriesea altodaserrae possesses more delicate
and more numerous inflorescence branches (20–30), thinner green to greenish-yellow
rachillas, and internodes 1.5–2 cm long. The primary bracts in
the upper portion of the rachis are broadly ovate and
3–6 cm long, and the floral bracts are yellow, ovate,
and 1.4–2 cm wide (Figure 3).
