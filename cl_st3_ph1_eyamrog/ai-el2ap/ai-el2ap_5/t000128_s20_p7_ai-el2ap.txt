A reduction in UFC/mL/cmÂ² was observed for all tested microorganisms
(Table 4). Both the extract and decoction demonstrated statistically significant
reductions in bacterial counts compared to the negative control across
all surfaces, except for Salmonella Typhimurium on steel, where no
significant difference was observed. These findings are consistent with those
reported by Oliveira et al. (2017). An effective disinfectant should
be capable of destroying or inactivating pathogenic organisms within a
reasonable timeframe, offer a favorable cost-benefit ratio, and be easy
and safe to transport, store, handle, and apply.
