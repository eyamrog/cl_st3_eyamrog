Immersion treatments involving 5% liquid detergent for 60 seconds followed
by 0.2% sodium hypochlorite for either 2 or 5 minutes
were effective in eliminating ciliates, microcrustaceans, nematodes, and small gastropods,
and also resulted in a significant reduction in the number
of annelids (Table 1). In contrast, treatment 5, which consisted
of thalli immersion in 5% liquid detergent followed by 0.2%
sodium hypochlorite for 1 minute, demonstrated the lowest effectiveness in
contaminant elimination. Small gastropods were completely eliminated in all treatments
that included 0.2% sodium hypochlorite (Table 1).
