The most recent assessment of bryophyte diversity in the state
of Espírito Santo reports 492 species (Costa & Peralta 2015),
of which 263 are mosses (Flora do Brasil 2020, 2021).
In contrast, Yano (2012) catalogued 531 bryophyte taxa for the
state, including 286 mosses distributed across 134 genera and 50
families. The observed reduction in species numbers may be attributed
to taxonomic synonymy or previous misidentifications; nevertheless, Espírito Santo remains
among the ten states with the highest bryophyte diversity in
Brazil (Costa & Peralta 2015; Flora do Brasil 2020, 2021).
Several studies have highlighted the bryofloristic potential of the state:
Peralta & Yano (2011) documented 89 moss species in the
Mello Leitão Museum herbarium, including 21 new records for Espírito
Santo; Silva (2011) identified 126 moss species, with 35 new
occurrences in Dense Montane and Upper Montane Ombrophilous Forest; Yano
(2016) reported 67 moss taxa in “Tabuleiro” Forests, with 15
new records; and Faria et al. (2020) recorded 102 moss
species, including 33 new occurrences, in an Ombrophilous Forest. In
the present study, nearly one quarter of the moss diversity
recorded for Espírito Santo (Flora do Brasil 2020, 2021) was
observed, along with nine new citations. Regarding family-level diversity, Gradstein
et al. (2001) identified Sematophyllaceae, Leucobryaceae, and Bryaceae as among
the richest moss families in the Neotropics, a pattern also
observed in Brazil and the Atlantic Forest (Costa & Peralta
2015). Sematophyllaceae is particularly common in the Atlantic Forest (Silva
Rodrigues & Valente 2015; Silva 2012; Valente et al. 2009;
Costa & Lima 2005) and, along with Bryaceae, is considered
the fifth richest family in Brazil. Leucobryaceae is widely distributed
globally and is frequently found in open areas of montane
rain forests, especially the genus Campylopus, which exhibits adaptations to
high light and desiccation, such as hyalocysts (hyaline cells) and
hair points (Gradstein et al. 2001; Glime 2007). Overall, the
Atlantic Forest, particularly its montane environments, supports a high diversity
of bryophytes.
