We next assessed whether it was necessary to include the
variable 'NPO age' in the model, based on the assumption
that nonprofit organizations require time to operate and implement governance
practices (e.g., Haski-Leventhal and Foot, 2016). However, analysis revealed no
statistically significant correlation between age and governance, as measured by
the sum of the dimension scores identified in the multiple
correspondence analysis (r = 0.093; p = 0.339). Consequently, this
variable was not included in the model.
