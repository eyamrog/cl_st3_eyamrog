Among the various news items circulating on social media, a
recent publication on Terra’s education portal titled "With the pandemic,
digital literacy becomes a step towards the pedagogy of the
future – basic education up to university teachers need to
be prepared during their training to use the Internet's interactivity,
audiovisual resources and hybrid models with classes mediated by technology"
addresses the evolving requirements for teacher preparation. Authored by journalists
Ocimara Balmant and Alex Gomes, the article recommends that teachers
acquire the skills necessary to engage with a new generation
of students who are deeply integrated with Information and Communication
Technologies (ICTs). The authors argue that these technologies have become
significant in their own right, prompting substantial curricular changes in
some teacher training programs to address the demands of contemporary
society. The article employs persuasive language to highlight the emergence
of a new era in education characterized by increased interactivity,
the use of the Internet, and audiovisual resources, thereby positioning
these developments as central to current educational innovation (Farias, 2020).
