The influence on the native language is particularly pronounced in
the cases of Colombia and Spain. In Spain, the proportion
of articles cited in Spanish, when the cited paper is
also in Spanish, is more than twice the proportion of
articles cited in English. A similar pattern is observed in
the United States, where 42.5 percent of citations are to
works published in English when the citing paper is in
English, compared to 14.7 percent when the citing paper is
published exclusively in Spanish.
