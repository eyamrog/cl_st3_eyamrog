Leaves are falcate, ranging from lanceolate to linear, with an
apiculate apex and a denticulate upper margin; long cells are
present at both the margin and the median portion of
the lamina. The specimens examined were collected on rocks near
streams, although the species generally occurs as a terricolous plant
in montane areas of the Atlantic Forest, and has been
recorded in the states of Goiás, Minas Gerais, Paraná, Rio
de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul, and São Paulo. This
species is classified as Vulnerable and is endemic to Brazil.
As it was not included in Flora do Brasil 2020
(2021), additional information was obtained from Dias, Peralta, and Neto
(2018).
