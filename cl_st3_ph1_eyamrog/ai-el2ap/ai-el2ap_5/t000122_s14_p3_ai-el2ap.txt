Specimens of B. binderi (approximately 900 mg) were maintained in
1000 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 700 mL of culture medium
under continuous aeration. The water temperature was maintained at 25
ºC, with a photon flux density of 60–80 µmol photons
m⁻² s⁻¹ and a photoperiod of 12:12 h (light:dark cycle)
to sustain the macroalgae in the laboratory for one week
prior to the chemical procedures for surface decontamination testing. The
culture medium consisted of sterilized seawater enriched with von Stosch’s
solution (8 mL L⁻¹), prepared according to Edwards (1970) and
modified by reducing the vitamin concentrations by 50% as described
by Yokoya (2000).
