The dominance of English in scientific communication has led to
its widespread use as the primary language for disseminating research
findings. Nevertheless, the use of native languages remains important for
effectively communicating research outcomes within certain local and regional contexts,
particularly in fields such as Public and Collective Health. In
recent years, there has been increased interest within the scientific
community in evaluating and promoting the responsible use of indicators
in research assessment. Consequently, several high-level position papers have been
published [37-41], some of which emphasize the significance of publishing
research in native languages.
