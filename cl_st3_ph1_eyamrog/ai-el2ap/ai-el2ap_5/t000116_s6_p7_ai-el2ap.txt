The reduction in the ACSC rate in the city of
Rio de Janeiro may indicate an effect of the changes
implemented through the new PNAB. Increased federal flexibility in public
policies may contribute to decision-making processes that are less evidence-based
and potentially less effective in managing local resources, which can
negatively affect population health and increase the risk of hospitalizations
for conditions that are manageable within primary health care (PHC).
Further research on this indicator is warranted to evaluate the
effectiveness of PHC, including the assessment of specific groups and
conditions, such as anemia and infections of the nose, throat,
and ear, that are considered sensitive to primary care interventions.
The Brazilian experience provides evidence that community-based primary care can
be effective when appropriately implemented.
