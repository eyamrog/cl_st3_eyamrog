Based on the theoretical framework established for each dimension, we
grouped certain variables with the dimensions for which they exhibited
the highest discrimination measures. Two variables were assigned to dimensions
where their discrimination measures were not the highest among all
possible associations; however, their discrimination measures exceeded the inertia of
the respective dimensions to which they were assigned.
