This variety closely resembles Eunotia rabenhorstii Cleve & Grunow var.
triodon Cleve & Grunow (1881: 12a); however, the presence of
a single undulation on the dorsal margin is a distinguishing
characteristic of var. monodon Cleve & Grunow (Patrick & Reimer
1966, Costa et al. 2017b). The species was rare, occurring
in only 2% of the core samples and reaching a
maximum abundance of 1%. It was identified in samples from
the Late Holocene (~408 cal. yr BP). This study represents
the first documented occurrence of the variety monodon in the
Brazilian Amazon.
