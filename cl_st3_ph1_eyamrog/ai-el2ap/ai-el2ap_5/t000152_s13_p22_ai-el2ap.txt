Internet access is particularly limited in the North and Northeast
regions of Brazil, where only 28.7% and 30% of the
population, respectively, have access. Nationally, only 23.9% of black and
mixed-race individuals have internet access (Brazilian Institute of Statistics and
Geography 2019). As the majority of the black population in
Brazil lives in poverty, black students are especially vulnerable to
limited access to quality internet services.
