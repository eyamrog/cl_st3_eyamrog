It differs from Gomphonema hawaiiense Reichardt (2005: 119) by exhibiting
smaller valve dimensions (length: 24.5–34.0 µm; width: 4.5–6.0 µm) compared
to G. hawaiiense (length: 32.6–55.0 μm; width: 6.3–9.5 μm) as
reported by Tremarin et al. (2009), as well as by
possessing curved subcapitate apices. The taxon was identified in 5%
of the core samples, with a maximum relative abundance of
1%. This species was detected in samples dating to the
end of the Mid-Holocene (~4,345 calibrated years BP). The present
study constitutes the first documented occurrence of this species in
the Brazilian Amazon.
