In South America, this ranking remains relatively uncommon, with only
35 universities included in the 2020 edition: 3 from Argentina,
20 from Brazil, 6 from Chile, 3 from Colombia, 2
from Ecuador, and 1 from Peru. Despite the limited overall
representation of Brazilian universities, Brazil demonstrates clear regional leadership within
this ranking.
