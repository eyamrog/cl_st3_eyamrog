The frequencies of total enteroparasites, individual enteroparasite species, and polyparasitism
observed before and after mass treatment of the population with
antiparasitic medication are presented in Table 1. Prior to treatment,
43 fecal samples were analyzed; 81.4% (35/43) tested positive for
enteroparasites, and 48.8% (21/43) exhibited polyparasitism, with the most frequent
co-occurrence being Hymenolepis nana and Entamoeba coli. Protozoan cysts were
detected in 79.1% (34/43) of the samples, while helminth eggs
were identified in 30.2% (13/43) of the samples.
