The development of the SciELO Citation Index is a recent
initiative that has replaced the previous global reference database, the
Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection. This initiative has primarily
been justified by its ability to increase the visibility and
accessibility of scientific output through open access, thereby enhancing the
exposure of nationally published journals. An additional factor contributing to
the credibility of the SciELO collection is its selectivity, which
is ensured by the rigorous assessment procedures and criteria implemented
by the scientific advisory committees of each member country within
the SciELO Network. However, numerous studies have demonstrated that research
published in nationally recognized, high-quality journals tends to receive fewer
citations compared to articles published in commercially operated, high-impact journals.
