The World Health Organization has reported that the underlying causes
of disruptions to non-communicable disease services differ across income groups,
with factors such as transportation challenges, insufficient personal protective equipment,
inadequate staffing, and limited availability of essential drugs and services
disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income countries. The authors recommend several
strategies to address these disruptions, including the implementation of patient
screening models, the use of appropriate electronic health records, expanded
access to medical consultations via telemedicine, and the development of
specific protocols for the management of non-communicable diseases during the
pandemic. It is essential to maintain a focus on the
core attributes of primary health care, namely access, continuity, comprehensiveness,
and coordination of care.
