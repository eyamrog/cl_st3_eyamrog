In the first case (Machado 2009), which is based on
data from my PhD research conducted approximately fifteen years ago,
the study focused on a specific population of Brazilian immigrants
in Porto in 2000. This group consisted predominantly of young,
single men employed in the restaurant sector. They formed a
close-knit community, maintaining regular social interactions and collectively participating in
the local Portuguese lifestyle. The experiences of these Brazilians were
shaped primarily by their integration into Portuguese kinship networks, which
were largely composed of individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. This
integration facilitated their entry into the labor market and influenced
their social realities. Notably, the relationship these immigrants maintained with
Brazil was characterized by a lack of intention to return,
a perspective closely linked to their incorporation into Portuguese kinship
structures. Visits to Brazil were considered significant primarily as opportunities
to reinforce a sense of Brazilianness, which played an important
role in their social interactions within the Brazilian community in
Porto.
