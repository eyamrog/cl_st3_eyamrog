In this text, the terms giftedness and talent (D&T) are
used as equivalents to the concept of high abilities/giftedness (AH/SD)
as defined by the National Council of Education of Brazil
(Resolução, 2001). The decision to depart from the official nomenclature
is based on concerns regarding the accuracy of terminology translation
and the necessity to address the process of talent development.
Giftedness is initially conceptualized as the possession and utilization of
exceptional natural abilities, which are biologically based and informally developed,
placing individuals among the top 10% of their peers (Gagné,
2018). Subsequently, talent is defined as the mastery of these
abilities through systematic development, resulting in competencies that are demonstrated
in at least one domain of human activity and position
the individual among the top 10% in that specific field
(Gagné, 2013a).
