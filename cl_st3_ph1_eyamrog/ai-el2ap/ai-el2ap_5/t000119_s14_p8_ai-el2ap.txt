Data analysis was conducted using a completely randomized design in
a 2 x 5 factorial arrangement, with two types of
salts and five levels of salinity. Percentage data were transformed
using the arcsine square root method. All data were subjected
to analysis of variance (ANOVA). When significant effects were detected,
qualitative variables were compared using the Scott-Knott test at a
5% significance level, while quantitative variables were analyzed by regression
analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using Sisvar software (Ferreira,
2011).
