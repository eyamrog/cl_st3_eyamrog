For studies involving species of Bostrychia and other estuarine macroalgae,
it is recommended to remove sediment from the samples in
the field, as macroalgae from these environments are frequently covered
with substantial amounts of sediment. Subsequently, in the laboratory, any
remaining adhered sediments and associated biota should be eliminated according
to established protocols.
