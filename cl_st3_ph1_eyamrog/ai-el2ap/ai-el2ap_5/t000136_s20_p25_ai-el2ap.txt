Following the procedures outlined by Sarstedt et al. (2020) and
Schamberger et al. (2020), additional analyses were conducted to verify
that the dataset does not contain outliers capable of distorting
the results of the structural equation models (as assessed by
Cook’s distance), that the relationships within the model are linear
(evaluated using the Linktest), and that the model is not
affected by omitted variable bias (tested using the RESET procedure).
The model was first estimated to facilitate these diagnostic tests,
utilizing the resulting construct scores as input. No outliers were
detected (Cook’s distance D < 1), the assumption of linearity
was supported (p-value = 0.09), and there was no evidence
of omitted variable bias (p-value = 0.31).
