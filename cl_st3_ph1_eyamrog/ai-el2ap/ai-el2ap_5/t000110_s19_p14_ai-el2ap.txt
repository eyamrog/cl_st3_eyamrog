Eunotia sp. is morphologically similar to Eunotia myrmica Lange-Bertalot (2011),
but differs by possessing broader, less cuneate apices and larger
valve dimensions, whereas E. myrmica exhibits narrower, cuneate apices and
smaller valves (Pavlov & Levkov 2013: L: 58.8–67 µm). This
taxon was infrequently recorded, occurring in 2% of the core
samples and attaining a maximum relative abundance of 1%. Its
presence is restricted to samples dated to the Late Holocene
(~811 calibrated years BP).
