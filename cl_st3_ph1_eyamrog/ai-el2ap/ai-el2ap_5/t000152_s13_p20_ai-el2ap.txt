The geographic remoteness of many municipalities and the limited availability
of broadband internet in both urban and rural households have
significantly constrained the adoption of distance learning modalities during the
pandemic. Data from the 2018 Survey on the Use of
Information and Communication Technologies in Brazilian Households, conducted by the
Brazilian Internet Steering Committee (2019) with a sample of just
over 33,000 households, indicate that internet access is not yet
universal, with particularly low coverage in rural areas, where only
44% of surveyed households reported having internet access.
