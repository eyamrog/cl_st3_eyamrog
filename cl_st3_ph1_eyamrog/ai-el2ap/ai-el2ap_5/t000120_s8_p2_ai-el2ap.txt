The nucleation technique aims to identify various elements, such as
microorganisms and seeds, in forest areas and subsequently transfer them
to disturbed sites to establish small nuclear habitats that promote
environmental heterogeneity across temporal and spatial scales. These nuclei serve
as ecological catalysts for the natural regeneration process and facilitate
the arrival and establishment of organisms capable of forming ecological
interactions (Reis et al. 2010; Reis et al. 2014). The
literature reports several nucleation techniques employed in restoration efforts, including
soil transposition, direct seeding, hydrosowing, branch transposition, installation of artificial
perches, and the planting of seedlings within high-diversity islands (Reis
et al. 2003).
