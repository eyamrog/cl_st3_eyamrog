The treatment of geo-helminthiasis in children within the school environment
is an effective strategy for controlling these parasites, as geo-helminths
do not multiply within the human host and the administration
of broad-spectrum anthelmintic drugs reduces both the prevalence and intensity
of infection at the individual and community levels. When selecting
areas for intervention, priority should be given to locations with
a high prevalence of geo-helminth infections and inadequate basic sanitation,
including insufficient water supply and lack of sewage collection and
treatment.
