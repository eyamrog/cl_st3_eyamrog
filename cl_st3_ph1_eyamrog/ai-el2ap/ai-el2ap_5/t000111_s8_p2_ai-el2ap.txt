I argue that sentences such as (1)a and (1)b contain
a free relative clause that conveys appositive content, rather than
constituting ordinary appositive relative clauses. The purpose of the present
discussion is twofold: first, to analyze the possible structure and
function of the wh-clauses in these utterances; and second, to
demonstrate that these clauses are distinct from ordinary appositive relative
clauses, such as the subordinate clause illustrated in (2).
