The second aspect, as outlined in the Introduction, concerns the
ongoing expectation for teachers to adapt to Internet connectivity through
the education portal of the Terra platform, often presented as
a significant innovation or as a forthcoming development in the
field of education. However, analysis indicates that despite the widespread
adoption of technological and communication devices—such as videos, short and
feature-length films, television, and various other media interfaces—the discourses surrounding
these developments exhibit consistent patterns and are rooted in established
discursive frameworks. Although these initiatives are currently portrayed as original
and innovative, they represent only superficial changes and reflect underlying
dynamics that have been present since the late twentieth century
(Noguera-Ramírez, 2009).
