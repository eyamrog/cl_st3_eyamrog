Given that most projections regarding the progression of the pandemic
in Brazil are pessimistic, it is essential that the State
be mandated to ensure internet access as a civil right
and to promote the use of the internet and information
and communication technologies (ICT) as a means of maintaining continuity
and retention in higher education. The State should develop sustainable
mechanisms to enhance the purchasing power of individuals for acquiring
laptop, desktop, or tablet computers. Additionally, it is the responsibility
of the State to provide students in vulnerable situations with
the necessary technological resources, thereby ensuring internet access for participation
in synchronous and/or hybrid classes in public higher education institutions
(HEIs). In both private and public HEIs, the regulatory role
of the State should extend beyond ensuring the availability of
academic programs to also guaranteeing equitable access for all students,
including, when necessary, the distribution of SIM cards to facilitate
internet connectivity.
