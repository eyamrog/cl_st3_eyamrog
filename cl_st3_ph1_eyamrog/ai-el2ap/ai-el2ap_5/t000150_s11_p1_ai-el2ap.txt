In network theory (Portes 1995), the focus shifts from the
economic rationality underlying traditional explanations of migration to the role
of social relations in shaping migratory processes. This approach seeks
to explain migration not solely through calculations of income differentials,
but by emphasizing the significance of social relationships, with the
family identified as a central node within migratory networks. However,
the concept of family employed in this framework tends to
be generic and universal, lacking engagement with anthropological debates on
kinship. The analysis assumes a generalized notion of family that
facilitates the articulation of migratory networks, without critically examining the
specific social structures—such as family, friendship, or neighborhood ties—that constitute
what is broadly referred to as kinship.
