The dependent variable in this study was the female mortality
rate due to aggression, calculated for each municipality in Sergipe
during the period from 2013 to 2017. To minimize temporal
and geographic fluctuations commonly observed in events of low frequency,
the mortality coefficients were aggregated over five years. Data on
female mortality due to aggression were obtained from the Mortality
Information System of the Brazilian Ministry of Health, with causes
of death classified according to categories X85 to Y09 of
the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10).
The total resident population for each municipality during the study
period was based on the 2010 population census and inter-census
year estimates provided by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and
Statistics. Femicide rates were calculated by dividing the number of
female deaths due to aggression in each municipality by the
total female population residing in the same municipality.
