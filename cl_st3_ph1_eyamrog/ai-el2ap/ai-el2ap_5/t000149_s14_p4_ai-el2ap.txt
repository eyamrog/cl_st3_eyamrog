The floristic survey was conducted at various times throughout the
year in natural areas subject to anthropogenic use. Standard species
identification methods were employed to determine the taxonomic groups present.
Field collection trips were carried out periodically, with consideration given
to prevailing climatic conditions and the rotation of cattle across
different pastures. During these visits, phenological data were recorded and
photographs were taken of both the plant specimens and their
respective habitats. Collected specimens were preserved through herbarium techniques, and
relevant environmental data were systematically documented. Species identification and determination
of biogeographic origin (native or exotic) were based on established
literature sources (Correa 1999; Kr√∂pfl et al. 2012; Velasco &
Siffredi 2009; Zuloaga et al. 2008) as well as electronic
databases of regional flora, including SIB (www.sib.gov.ar) and the Catalogue
of Flora Argentina maintained by the Darwinion Botanical Institute (www2.darwin.edu.ar/Proyectos/FloraArgentina/FA.asp).
