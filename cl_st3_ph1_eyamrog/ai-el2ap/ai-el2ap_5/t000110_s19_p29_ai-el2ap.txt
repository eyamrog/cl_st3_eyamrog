Sellaphora emilia Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot is classified within the bacillum
group of the genus Sellaphora (Mann et al. 2008). It
can be distinguished from Sellaphora renata Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot by
its valves, which have consistently straight margins, less broadly rounded
ends, and smaller valve dimensions (S. emilia: length 45.0–124.0 µm,
width 12.0–14.0 µm; S. renata: length 45.0–140.0 µm, width 15.0–21.0
µm). In the present study, S. emilia was detected in
only 2% of the core samples, with a maximum relative
abundance of 1%. The species was also identified in samples
corresponding to the Late Holocene (~1,757 calibrated years BP). This
study represents the first documented occurrence of S. emilia in
Brazil.
