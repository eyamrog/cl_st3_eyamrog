The first germination count, conducted seven days after sowing, showed
that seeds exhibited delayed germination under saline stress. A progressive
decline in the percentage of normal seedlings was observed with
increasing NaCl concentrations, with complete inhibition of germination occurring at
-0.3 MPa of CaCl2 (Figure 1b). This result may be
attributed to a reduced rate of seed water absorption as
water potential decreases, while elevated salt concentrations can induce cytotoxicity
and cellular dehydration, thereby diminishing metabolic activity and inhibiting the
synthesis of new tissues due to limited water availability (Marcos
Filho, 2015). Consequently, reduced water accessibility can lower the proportion
of seeds completing germination or entirely prevent the process (Velázquez-Márquez
et al., 2015).
