Evaluation of the Natural Regeneration of Plant Species â€“ Monitoring
of the experimental unit revealed that, from the initiation of
treatment on October 12, 2017, to the second sampling on
July 12, 2018, there was a substantial increase in the
growth of Urochloa brizantha (Hochst. ex A. Rich.) R. D.
Webster across all plots. During this period, no germination of
seedlings from shrub or arboreal plant species, nor from other
weed species, was observed.
