There was a predominance of significant spatial clusters of femicide
rates in the central region of Sergipe (Fig. 2), as
confirmed by the Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) analysis
(Fig. 3). Previous studies have indicated the possibility of unique
contextual factors in central Sergipe, although no spatial dependence of
femicide rates was identified among Sergipeâ€™s municipalities in 2017. However,
findings by Grana and by Meneghel & Portella suggest that
the incidence of femicide is higher in urban agglomerations and
cities with greater population density. The contexts in which femicides
occur are diverse and are often associated with specific geographical
and gender-related factors. An increase in femicide has been observed
in areas characterized by a predominance of patriarchal culture, which
is a persistent feature of Sergipe society. This pattern was
evident in the clusters of municipalities in Sergipe that exhibited
"high-high" spatial autocorrelation. In these areas, there is significant livestock
activity and a strong valorization of traditional male gender roles,
where attributes such as courage, strength, and virility are considered
essential for work with cattle, and these values often extend
to broader gender relations and daily life. Similar conditions have
been reported in other regions of Brazil with comparable economic
structures and enduring patriarchal norms, where the subordination of women
to men remains prevalent.
