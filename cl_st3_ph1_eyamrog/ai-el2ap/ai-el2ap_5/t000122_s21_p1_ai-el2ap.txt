Ciliates, microcrustaceans, nematodes, annelids, and small gastropods present in samples
of thalli culture medium from all treatments and the control
were quantified using stereoscopic and optical microscopy. Immersion treatments involving
5% liquid detergent for 60 seconds followed by 1% povidone
iodine were not effective in eliminating contaminants from the thalli
surface, as the mean number of contaminants (individuals mL⁻¹) did
not differ significantly among these treatments and the control (Table
1).
