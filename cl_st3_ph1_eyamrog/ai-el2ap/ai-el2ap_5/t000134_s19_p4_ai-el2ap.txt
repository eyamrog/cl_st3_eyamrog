Overall, 30 amphibian species (approximately 80% of the total) and
10 reptile species (28%) recorded in the PNT are endemic
to the Atlantic Forest biome (Tables 1 and 2). Six
amphibian species—Aplastodiscus albofrenatus, Dendrophryniscus brevipollicatus, Euparkerella brasiliensis, Hylodes nasus, Ischnocnema
guentheri, and Scinax trapicheiroi—are considered endemic to the state of
Rio de Janeiro. The majority of amphibian and reptile species
are classified as Least Concern or Not Threatened according to
international, national (Brazilian), and state conservation status lists. However, six
amphibian species and one reptile species recorded in the PNT
are listed in a threatened category. Additionally, populations of 15
amphibian species are believed to be declining (Table 1). Two
reptile species, the lizard Hemidactylus mabouia and the chelonian Trachemys
scripta, are considered exotic (Table 2).
