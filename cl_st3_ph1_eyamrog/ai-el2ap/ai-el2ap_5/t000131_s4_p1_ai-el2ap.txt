The results indicate that M. laevigata exhibited superior growth performance
under conditions of 25% reduction in solar radiation flux, rather
than under full sunlight, which contradicts the initial hypothesis. Additionally,
both Mikania species demonstrated limited growth capacity under shaded conditions.
Nevertheless, under shading, both species allocated a greater proportion of
biomass to shoot development, which may be associated with an
adaptive strategy to enhance vertical growth. Although lianas are generally
characterized as light-dependent plants, the two species displayed distinct responses
to identical irradiance conditions. Specifically, M. laevigata achieved optimal growth
under 25% irradiance reduction, whereas M. glomerata exhibited better growth
across a broader range, from 0% to 50% irradiance reduction.
