At the species level, four Asteraceae species—Centaurea calcitrapa L., Centaurea
solstitialis L., Gaillardia megapotamica (Spreng.) Baker, and Gamochaeta filaginea (DC.)
Cabrera—are present at all study sites and are typically associated
with highly disturbed environments. The Poaceae family is represented by
three species—Bromus catharticus Vahl. var. catharticus, Hordeum murinum L., and
Nassella tenuis (Phil.) Barkworth—which constitute the primary forage plants in
the area. Two Brassicaceae species, Eruca vesicaria Mill. and Sysimbrium
irio, both of which are exotic and commonly occur along
road verges and power line tracks, were also recorded. Additionally,
four families are each represented by a single species across
all sites: Amsinckia calycina (Moris) Chater (Boraginaceae), Stellaria media (L.)
Cirillo (Caryophyllaceae), which in PP and FE is found beneath
shrubs, Euphorbia collina Phil. (Euphorbiaceae), and Plantago patagonica Jacq. (Plantaginaceae).
