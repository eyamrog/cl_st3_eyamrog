This paper evaluates the performance of Brazilian universities in the
U-Multirank from 2017 to 2020. U-Multirank is a multidimensional academic
ranking system developed in Europe, with results available since 2014.
It employs five dimensions to assess universities, aiming to identify
both strengths and weaknesses without producing a single overall ranking
of institutions. This approach is particularly relevant in Brazil, as
it has been adopted by Capes for the forthcoming evaluation
of the national postgraduate system, albeit with some adaptations. In
2020, only 20 Brazilian universities were included in U-Multirank, which,
although a relatively small number, is regionally significant given that
only 35 South American universities are listed in total.
