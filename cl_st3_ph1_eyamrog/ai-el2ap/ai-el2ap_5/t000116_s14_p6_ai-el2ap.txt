After completing the initial stage, we conducted a visual inspection
of the time series to identify changes in the patterns
of total hospitalizations and within specific groups across the three
defined periods, based on the sequential information from these intervals.
To assess the impact of changes in primary care policy
on all ACSC groups, we applied segmented linear regression models
within an interrupted time series (ITS) framework. ITS models account
for pre-existing trends prior to the policy intervention and are
capable of detecting both level and trend changes following the
intervention. We constructed the segmented linear regression models using the
Prais method, incorporating three segments corresponding to the previously defined
periods. The baseline segment, covering January 2008 to December 2009,
was specified with both an intercept and a trend estimate
variable.
