Studies have demonstrated an increase in femicides in Brazilian capitals
and large cities during the three-year periods of 2007–2009 and
2011–2013, particularly among young, economically disadvantaged, Black, single, and low-educated
women. Some research has identified a positive association between poverty
and female homicide rates, indicating that women living in poverty
are disproportionately affected. The circumstances surrounding women's homicides are varied
and are influenced by distinct social dynamics and characteristics specific
to each geographic context, with gender consistently serving as a
significant factor.
