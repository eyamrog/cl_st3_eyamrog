The term "machinery" in this context refers to the construction
of theoretical and analytical models of explanation, such as those
found in sociology and anthropology. This concept is intended to
emphasize that these models function as structured tools or mechanisms
for organizing and facilitating analytical thought. It is important to
recognize that these models are not entities in themselves; rather,
they serve as instruments for conceptualizing and interpreting the events
and processes under investigation.
