In indigenous villages, health services frequently remain unable to control
infections despite the implementation of sanitation measures. This limitation is
primarily attributable to the high transmission rates of parasitic diseases,
which are facilitated by the prevailing environmental and socio-cultural conditions
within these populations. Consequently, parasitic infections continue to represent a
significant public health concern.
