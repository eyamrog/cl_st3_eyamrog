In a study utilizing four different osmotic agents (CaCl2, KCl,
MgCl2, and NaCl), Stefanello et al. (2019) reported that chia
seeds (Salvia hispanica L.) exhibited sensitivity to varying salt exposures
at osmotic potentials ranging from -0.1 to -0.4 MPa, as
evidenced by reductions in both germination and vigor. Similarly, Barbieri
et al. (2019) demonstrated that a progressive decrease in osmotic
potential, induced by NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2, adversely affected
seed germination and the initial growth of quinoa seedlings (Chenopodium
quinoa Willd.).
