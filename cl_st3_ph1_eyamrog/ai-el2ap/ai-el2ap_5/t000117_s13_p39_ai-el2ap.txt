In parallel with the deterritorialization and dematerialization of schools, there
has been a trend toward their reterritorialization into spaces and
ambiances mediated by information and communication technologies (ICTs). The locations
where individuals reside, such as homes, have increasingly become learning
environments. As households are transformed into multifunctional spaces, with learning
as a primary function, the educational space previously associated with
formal school institutions has been reterritorialized and relocated into private
residences and, more broadly, into various everyday environments, as reflected
in discourses on the educating city. Digital screens and their
associated connectivity now serve as interfaces—through virtual classrooms—to other environments
and geographical locations, regardless of their proximity. However, without the
physical infrastructure of fiber optic cables installed underground or on
the seabed, it is not possible to ensure universal digital
connectivity or to sustain the globalized digital interactions that characterize
contemporary society.
