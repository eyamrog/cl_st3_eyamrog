Results: The spatial distribution of femicide rates exhibited significant spatial
autocorrelation, indicating a non-random pattern with a concentration of municipalities
with the highest mortality rates due to femicide in the
central region of Sergipe State. In the multiple regression analysis,
both the percentage of female-headed households and the Municipal Human
Development Index were positively associated with femicide rates in the
municipalities of Sergipe during the study period (p < 0.05).
In contrast, the GINI Index demonstrated a negative association with
femicide rates.
