In this context, the National Policy for Special Education from
the Perspective of Inclusive Education (PNEE-EI/08) aims to enhance the
learning outcomes of students in Brazil who have disabilities, developmental
disorders, or giftedness, and to promote their participation in and
access to mainstream schools by addressing their specific educational needs
(Brasil, 2008). To achieve these objectives, the policy established Specialized
Educational Service Classrooms (AEE), Special and Inclusive Education Centers (NUEEI),
and Giftedness Service Centers (NAAHS).
