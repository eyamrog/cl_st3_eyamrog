The results of the diffusion tests using both the decoction
and hydroalcoholic extract from C. ferrea leaves against bacterial strains
are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Staphylococcus aureus and
Enterococcus faecalis exhibited sensitivity to the decoction of L. ferrea
at a concentration of 100 mg/mL, with inhibition zones measuring
10 mm and 10.67 mm, respectively. According to the criteria
established by Thomazi, Bertolin, and Pinto (2010), these inhibition zone
diameters are considered satisfactory, as values equal to or greater
than 10 mm indicate sensitivity.
