A broader comparison can be conducted by examining a larger
sample of European universities. Among the top 300 European universities
in 2020, based on the average of the evaluated dimensions,
85.72% of the data were available, 10.20% were missing, and
4.08% were classified as “not applicable.” These figures likely represent
an upper benchmark, as they pertain to the highest-performing institutions
in Europe, where the ranking system originated. In comparison, Brazilian
institutions exhibit data availability approximately 40% lower than that of
the top 300 European universities.
