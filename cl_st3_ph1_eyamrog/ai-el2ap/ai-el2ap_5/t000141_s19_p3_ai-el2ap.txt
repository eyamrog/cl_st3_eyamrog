In the analyzed sample (n = 18), reopening plans, decrees,
and technical notes were identified, as detailed in Table 1.
The states of Amazonas, Ceará, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Piauí,
Rio de Janeiro, and Sergipe included health metrics for economic
reopening in their official reopening documents. Acre, Pará, Paraíba, Rondônia,
Rio Grande do Sul, and São Paulo provided indicators for
epidemic monitoring in both reopening plans and in decrees and
technical notes. Alagoas, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Rio
Grande do Norte, and Santa Catarina formalized monitoring indicators exclusively
through decrees and technical notes. The remaining states—Amapá, Bahia, Distrito
Federal, Goiás, Maranhão, Pernambuco, Paraná, Roraima, and Tocantins—produced documents that
did not satisfy the study's inclusion criteria.
