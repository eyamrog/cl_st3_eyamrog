The confounding variable assessed in this study was the population
size of municipalities, obtained from the Brazilian Institute of Geography
and Statistics and categorized as follows: a) ≤ 20,000 inhabitants;
b) 20,001 to 50,000 inhabitants; c) 50,001 to 150,000 inhabitants;
and d) > 150,000 inhabitants. Data on coverage by the
Family Health Strategy and Oral Health Teams were collected monthly
at the municipal level as proportions (%) and were sourced
from primary care information and management databases. Coverage was classified
as: a) absent (0%); b) incipient (<30%); c) intermediate (30–70%);
and d) consolidated (≥70%). Municipalities were classified according to the
Human Development Index (HDI) as follows: low (<0.55), average (0.55–0.699),
high (0.70–0.799), and very high (≥0.80). The Gini index, obtained
from the United Nations Development Program databases (http://www.atlasbrasil.org.br/2013/), was included
as a continuous variable in the model. Brazil is divided
into five geopolitical regions: Southeast, South, Midwest, North, and Northeast.
The proportions of physicians and nurses per 10,000 inhabitants for
2020 were obtained from the human resources section of the
National Register of Health Establishments (CNES). Additionally, the rate of
basic health units per 10,000 inhabitants was calculated.
