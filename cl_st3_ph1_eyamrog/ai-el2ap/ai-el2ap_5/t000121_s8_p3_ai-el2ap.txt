Widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, are associated
with increased psychological distress and symptoms of mental illness. The
majority of existing studies have been conducted in China, the
initial epicenter of the pandemic, and have primarily reported anxiety
disorders and common mental disorders (CMD) associated with the occurrence
of COVID-19 in various countries (Huang & Zhao, 2020). Evidence
from previous studies on similar events, such as MERS-CoV and
SARS-CoV, indicates that measures to separate and restrict the movement
of people have a significant impact on mental health, leading
to negative psychological outcomes such as CMD (Brooks et al.,
2020; Jiloha, 2020). Symptoms including stress, irritability, insomnia, post-traumatic stress
disorder, depression, anxiety, substance abuse, suicide attempts, and self-injurious behaviors
are frequently observed among healthcare professionals and the general population,
who, in these stressful situations, experience concerns about future uncertainties
and heightened fear of contagion and death (Brooks et al.,
2020; Faro et al., 2020). In a study involving 1,210
participants, higher rates of anxiety and depression were found among
women, students, individuals with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, and those
with poor health perceptions, whereas access to information and engagement
in preventive behaviors such as handwashing appeared to mitigate these
effects (Wang et al., 2020).
