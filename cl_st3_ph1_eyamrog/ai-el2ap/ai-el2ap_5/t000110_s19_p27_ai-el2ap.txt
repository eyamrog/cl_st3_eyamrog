The population of Diploneis elliptica (Kützing) Cleve var. elliptica exhibited
valve morphology and striae density consistent with the descriptions provided
by Krammer and Lange-Bertalot (1986: fig. 108: 1–4). However, specimens
from the Xingu River samples were smaller than the previously
reported size range for the species (L: 20–130 μm). The
taxon was present in 2.6% of the core samples, with
a maximum relative abundance of 3%. D. elliptica var. elliptica
was identified in samples dated to the Late Holocene (~1,730
to 560 cal. yr BP). This study represents the first
documented occurrence of this species in the Brazilian Amazon.
