This material is identified as Achnanthes cf. inflata (Kützing) Grunow
based on the observation that its representative specimens exhibit slightly
less rounded ends compared to those described by Grunow (1868),
while other morphological features are consistent with the original description.
The specimens analyzed possess wider valve ends than those of
Achnanthes inflata var. elata (Leuduger-Fortmorel) Hustedt (1937: 206), and can
be distinguished from Achnanthes coarctata (Brébisson ex W. Smith) Grunow
(1880: 20) by the presence of a central inflation at
the valve margin and the absence of the constriction characteristic
of the latter. The species was present in only 2%
of the core samples, with a maximum relative abundance of
1% in samples dated to the Late Holocene (~625 cal.
yr BP). This constitutes the first record of this species
in the Brazilian Amazon.
