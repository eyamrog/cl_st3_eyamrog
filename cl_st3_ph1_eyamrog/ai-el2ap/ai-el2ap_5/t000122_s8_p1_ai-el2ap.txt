Laboratory culture techniques for macroalgae are essential tools in ecophysiological
research and for the production of compounds of interest to
humans (Fernandes et al., 2011). Berland et al. (1972) reported
that contaminants present in macroalgal culture media often proliferate more
rapidly than the macroalgae themselves, thereby competing for nutrients and
releasing substances that can inhibit algal growth. According to Fernandes
et al. (2011), establishing and maintaining macroalgal cultures free from
contaminating organisms remains a significant challenge for researchers. Various contaminants,
including cyanobacteria, microalgae, fungi, heterotrophic bacteria, protozoa, and invertebrates, are
capable of growing in these cultures. Typically, the primary source
of contamination in macroalgal cultures is the biota associated with
the algal surface.
