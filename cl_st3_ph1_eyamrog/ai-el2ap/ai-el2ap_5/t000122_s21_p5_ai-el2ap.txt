The results of this study demonstrate that immersion in 5%
liquid detergent for 60 seconds is not effective for the
surface decontamination of Bostrychia species, as neither this treatment nor
immersion in 1% povidone iodine resulted in the elimination of
contaminating organisms. In contrast, immersion in 0.2% sodium hypochlorite was
effective, indicating that this concentration is suitable for the surface
decontamination of macroalgae. Although 5% liquid detergent alone does not
achieve decontamination, it may facilitate the removal of lipid layers
from contaminating organisms, thereby enhancing the efficacy of sodium hypochlorite,
as previously reported by Holdt et al. (2014).
