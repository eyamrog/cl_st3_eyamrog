In this paper, I focus on examining the proximity and
similarity between the appositive construction in (11)a and the data
presented in (1), which constitute the primary subject of analysis.
It is important to note that, in Brazilian Portuguese, the
syntactic configuration of the apposition in (11)a differs from that
in (11)b; specifically, (11)b involves a relative clause, whereas (11)a
does not.
