The data indicate that the predominance of English-language publications is
specific to the Web of Science (WoS) database. Within WoS,
Portuguese is the second most frequently used publication language, while
Spanish, although less prevalent, still constitutes a significant proportion. In
contrast, the distribution of publication languages in SciELO CI differs
substantially, with Spanish accounting for approximately 40% of the papers
and Portuguese being more prominent than English. Science is inherently
a global enterprise, and scientific knowledge is intended to have
worldwide relevance and accessibility. This global orientation has been described
as the "Fourth Age of Research," characterized by a shift
from individual, institutional, and national research efforts to international collaboration.
International collaboration facilitates the resolution of global challenges and provides
access to advanced infrastructure and funding opportunities. Furthermore, such collaboration
is associated with increased research impact, as measured by citation
metrics. Researcher mobility, as evidenced by bibliometric analyses, and the
structure of international collaboration networks have been the focus of
several studies, which also highlight the role of research funding
in supporting these networks. Research conducted in one country or
region can be highly relevant to other geographical areas, particularly
in fields such as Public and Collective Health. While English
serves as the lingua franca of science and enables communication
with an international audience, it remains important to conduct and
disseminate research in national languages to ensure its accessibility and
impact within local communities.
