Microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are capable
of adapting to diverse environments and can be transmitted by
humans through food, as well as being present in environmental
sources including air, dust, and sewage water. Increasingly, these microorganisms
are developing resistance to commonly used chemical disinfectants, which may
result from improper use and disposal of these agents, the
formation of biofilms, or the horizontal transfer of resistance genes
(Dolan and Costerton, 2002).
