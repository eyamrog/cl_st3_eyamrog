Given that teachers are the professionals who theoretically possess the
necessary knowledge to identify and refer Black D&T students to
the school's AEE, they are in the most favorable position
to observe and support these students, as their family members
and friends typically lack this expertise. Consequently, there is a
risk that these students may never have the opportunity to
develop their natural abilities or realize their talents, which can
result in continued invisibility and the accumulation of disadvantages. The
research is ongoing; however, preliminary findings indicate the existence of
a fourth form of invisibility in Brazil, specifically affecting gifted
Black women from the northern region of the country.
