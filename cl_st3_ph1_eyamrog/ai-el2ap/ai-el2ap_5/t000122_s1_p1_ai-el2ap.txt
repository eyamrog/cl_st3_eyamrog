This study evaluated the effectiveness of various physical and chemical
procedures for the surface decontamination of Bostrychia binderi Harvey. Thalli
were subjected to washing and immersion in chemical solutions, including
5% liquid detergent, 1% povidone iodine, and 0.2% sodium hypochlorite,
applied for different durations and in various combinations. Following these
treatments, the thalli were cultivated under laboratory conditions to assess
any adverse effects of the decontamination procedures on algal viability.
The presence of contaminating organisms in the culture medium was
quantified at the end of the cultivation period. The combination
of washing, spraying, manual removal of macrofauna with tweezers, immersion
in 5% liquid detergent for 60 seconds, and subsequent immersion
in 0.2% sodium hypochlorite for 2 minutes was effective in
eliminating all analyzed contaminants. Immersion in 1% povidone iodine did
not negatively impact thalli growth, whereas immersion in 0.2% sodium
hypochlorite for 5 minutes resulted in adverse effects. Based on
these findings, the protocol proposed in this study is recommended
for the establishment of unialgal cultures of Bostrychia binderi.
