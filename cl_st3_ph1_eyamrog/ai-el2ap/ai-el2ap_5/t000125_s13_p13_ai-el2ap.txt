open sources: co-publications with industrial partners, patents awarded (size-normalized), industry
co-patents, and publications cited in patents. The indicators income from
continuous professional development, income from private sources, and spin-offs rely
on institutional reports. ESPM is the only institution with three
indicators rated as A, followed by five institutions with two
