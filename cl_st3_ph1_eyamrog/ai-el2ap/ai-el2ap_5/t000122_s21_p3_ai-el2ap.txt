A reduction in biomass of B. binderi was observed at
the second weighing (after one week of cultivation) across all
treatments involving chemical procedures (Figure 1). This biomass loss may
be attributed to the negative effects of the chemical compounds
on the macroalga. However, by the third weighing (after three
weeks of cultivation), the thalli exhibited biomass recovery, as indicated
by an increase in weight (Figure 1). There were no
significant differences in the final weights of the thalli among
the different treatments.
