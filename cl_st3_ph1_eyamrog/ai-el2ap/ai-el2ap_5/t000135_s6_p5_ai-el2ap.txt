Controlled detachment raises significant concerns globally due to its potential
unintended consequences, including the disruption, partial functioning, or redirection of
primary health care (PHC) services. The World Health Organization has
reported a 75% reduction in services for non-communicable diseases such
as diabetes and hypertension, with this decline being more pronounced
in lower-income countries. These findings underscore the risk of delayed
treatment and monitoring for patients with conditions that require ongoing
health care. In particular, for the conditions examined in this
study—diabetes and prenatal care—such delays may contribute to increased rates
of mortality, infant mortality, and disability in 2021.
