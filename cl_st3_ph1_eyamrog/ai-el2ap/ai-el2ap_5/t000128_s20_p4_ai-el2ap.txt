Table 3 presents the results of the growth curve analysis
using the hydroalcoholic extract and decoction of L. ferrea on
strains that demonstrated sensitivity at the optimal concentration (100 mg/mL),
as determined by the well diffusion technique. For the decoction,
the E. faecalis strain exhibited a reduction in absorbance of
0.24. Although S. aureus showed a decrease in absorbance of
0.07, this change was not statistically significant. Regarding the extract,
a reduction in bacterial growth was observed after 24 hours,
with the P. aeruginosa strain showing a decrease in absorbance
of 0.36. In contrast, increases in absorbance values were observed
for Corynebacterium spp. (0.06), E. faecalis (0.03), and Salmonella Typhimurium
(0.14); however, these changes were not statistically significant compared to
the positive control.
