Another important aspect of the ranking is that it does
not include any indicators based on "reputation" surveys, unlike other
popular rankings such as QS and THE; consequently, its results
are derived exclusively from objective indicators. However, a limitation of
this ranking is the reliance on a large number of
indicators that require data from questionnaires submitted by the institutions
themselves, many of which do not provide regular reports. As
a result, missing data is a common issue in this
ranking.
