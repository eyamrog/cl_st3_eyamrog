In other contemporary discourses disseminated internationally, there is an effort
to address perceived shortcomings of Western civilization by advocating for
a return to nature as the foundation of children's education.
Rather than viewing the school as an institution primarily responsible
for transmitting academic knowledge and social norms, these perspectives promote
the concept of the “school as a site for meeting
nature.” This approach is exemplified by the Brazilian publication *Demmuring
Childhood*, now in its second edition (2018), which presents an
educational model grounded in the principle of allowing children the
freedom to play in direct contact with nature. The publication
documents experiences from both public and private schools in Brazil
and abroad that have adopted practices aimed at “demmuring” childhood.
This initiative is led by Instituto Alana in collaboration with
the Child and Nature (Criança e Natureza) project, as well
as other civil society organizations focused on education and childhood
development.
