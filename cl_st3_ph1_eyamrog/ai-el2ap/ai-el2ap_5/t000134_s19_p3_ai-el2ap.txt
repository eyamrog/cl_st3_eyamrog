The Whittaker plots (Figure 9) indicated substantial variation in the
abundance of amphibian and reptile species, with the log-series model
providing the best fit for the observed data. Among amphibians
(Table 1), the most abundant species were Ischnocnema parva (N
= 617 records; 19.4% of all amphibians), Hylodes nasus (N
= 601; 18.9%), Ischnocnema guentheri (N = 544; 17.1%), and
Crossodactylus gaudichaudii (N = 500; 15.8%). The most frequently recorded
reptiles were the lizards Enyalius brasiliensis (N = 55; 48.2%
of all reptiles) and Ecpleopus gaudichaudii (N = 15; 13.2%),
which together accounted for 61.4% of all reptile records during
the surveys (Table 2). The most abundant snake species were
Bothrops jararacussu (N = 8; 7.0% of all reptiles), Thamnodynastes
cf. nattereri (N = 7; 6.1%), and Bothrops jararaca (N
= 6; 5.3%).
