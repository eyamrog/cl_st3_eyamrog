Agency theory examines the conflicts that arise between principals and
agents, and in this study, its assumptions and concepts are
applied to the context of the third sector, consistent with
prior research such as Ho and Huang (2017), Blevins, Ragozzino,

Based on this framework, the central hypothesis of this study
