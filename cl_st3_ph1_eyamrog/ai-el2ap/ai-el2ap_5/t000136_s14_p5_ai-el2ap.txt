Data were collected through a documentary survey of financial statements,
annual activity reports, and statutes, which were obtained from the
websites of non-profit organizations (NPOs) or accessed via the "Map
of Civil Society Organizations" repository. Additionally, for NPOs whose documents
were not publicly available, we contacted the organizations directly by
telephone and email, utilizing contact information provided by the Brazilian
National Environment Council (CONAMA).
