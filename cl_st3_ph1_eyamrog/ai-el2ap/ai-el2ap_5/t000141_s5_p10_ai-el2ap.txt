Another common issue identified was the limited transparency regarding the
composition of document development teams. Only ten plans included descriptions
of the authors' professional backgrounds, with a notable predominance of
technicians. The involvement of researchers and educators in the preparation
of these documents was either minimal or not reported, with
the exceptions of the states of Espírito Santo(16) and Piauí(19).
References to community participation were found exclusively in Pará. This
lack of comprehensive stakeholder engagement in the development of the
plans may hinder efforts to raise public awareness and foster
community involvement, suggesting a disconnect between the scientific community and
the public policy development process.
