Staurosirella dubia (Grunow) E.A. Morales & K.M. Manoylov exhibits a
valve outline similar to that of Staurosirella pinnata (Ehrenberg) D.M.
Williams & Round (1988: 274). However, S. dubia can be
distinguished by its larger valves, a lanceolate outline in larger
specimens, an elliptical outline in smaller specimens, and wider striae
(Morales 2010). This species was identified in 56% of the
core samples, with a maximum relative abundance of 6%. It
was present in samples dating from the end of the
Mid-Holocene (~6,000 cal. yr BP) to the top of the
core. The present study constitutes the first documented occurrence of
this species in the Brazilian Amazon.
