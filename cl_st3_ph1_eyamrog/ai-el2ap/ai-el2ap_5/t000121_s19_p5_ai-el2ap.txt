In the third model, which examined the outcome of a
single diagnosis (either anxious or depressive symptoms), individuals aged up
to 24 years had a 1.5-fold higher likelihood of presenting
with one of these symptomatologies compared to those aged 31
to 39 years (OR = 0.7; 1/OR = 1.4), and
a twofold higher likelihood compared to individuals over 39 years
of age (OR = 0.5; 1/OR = 2). In terms
of income, participants without a steady income were more likely
to exhibit symptoms than those with a steady income (OR
= 1.3). Additionally, individuals who perceived themselves as ill had
higher odds of presenting symptoms compared to those who perceived
themselves as healthy (OR = 2.4). Participants who scored above
the mean on the meta-worry scale were approximately 11.5 times
more likely to exhibit symptoms indicative of anxiety or depression
than those who scored at or below the mean (OR
= 11.4).
