This study aimed to examine femicide, a consequence of violence
against women and a significant public health issue, from an
economic perspective. Specifically, it investigated the relationship between foreign exchange
rates—identified as a key factor in economic crises and unemployment—and
femicide, which is distinct from general homicide due to its
gender-based nature. Data were obtained from the We Will Stop
Femicide Platform and the Central Bank of the Republic of
Turkey and analyzed using various statistical methods. The results indicate
the existence of a long-term cointegrating relationship between the foreign
exchange rate and femicide in Turkey. The analysis further shows
that a 1% shock in the exchange rate is balanced
after approximately 22.6 days. This study contributes to the literature
by addressing femicide from an underexplored economic perspective and demonstrates
that empirical analyses of exchange rate fluctuations are relevant not
only to economic outcomes but also to public health and
social issues.
