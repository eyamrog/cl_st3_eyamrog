The most abundant reptile species recorded in the PNT were
Enyalius brasiliensis and Ecpleopus gaudichaudii, which together accounted for approximately
60% of the total reptilian abundance observed in this study.
Enyalius brasiliensis, a species typically associated with forested environments, was
found to be relatively abundant in the study area compared
to other forest remnants in the state of Rio de
Janeiro, as reported in both short-term (Morro São João; Almeida-Gomes
et al. 2008) and mid-term studies (Guapiaçu Ecological Reserve; Almeida-Gomes
& Rocha 2014a). Ecpleopus gaudichaudii, a Gymnophthalmidae species endemic to
the Atlantic Forest, is generally recognized as a major component
of local leaf-litter reptile communities, as documented in previous studies
(Dixo & Verdade 2006; Almeida-Gomes & Rocha 2014a; Cruz et
al. 2014).
