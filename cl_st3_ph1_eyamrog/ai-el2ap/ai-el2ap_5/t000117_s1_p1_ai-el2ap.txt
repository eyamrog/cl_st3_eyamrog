This study aims to analyze the effects of the reports
on the dematerialization of schooling by Edgard Faure (1973) and
Jacques Delors (1998), a process that has been accelerated by
the COVID-19 pandemic. Both reports focus on the intersection of
education and Information and Communication Technologies, particularly in relation to
audiovisual and internet resources. The central hypothesis is that the
discourses surrounding the learning society—one emphasizing the adoption of new
teaching techniques and the other addressing the “demmuring” of childhood—converge
in facilitating the dematerialization of schooling, while the pandemic has
created conditions in which deterritorialization has become temporarily unavoidable. The
conclusion highlights that, within the current urban context and under
the premise that all artifacts possess educational value, learning now
functions as the foundation for already “demmured” and dematerialized spatial
environments.
