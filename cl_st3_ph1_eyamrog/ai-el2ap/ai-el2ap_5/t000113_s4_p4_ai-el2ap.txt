The situation is further complicated for these students, as many
private and public schools have not implemented AEE Rooms, as
observed during field research (Abad, 2018), despite existing public policies
mandating support for D&T students. Consequently, these schools are not
in compliance with Resolution CNE/CEB nº 4/2009 of the National
Council of Education, which, in Article 5, requires the implementation
of AEE primarily in the schools’ own multifunctional resource rooms
during the opposite shift of regular classes.
