Figure 1 illustrates the global prevalence of femicide. Accessing reliable
data on this issue remains challenging due to its sensitive
nature, necessitating a multidimensional approach to data collection and analysis.
It is essential and in the public interest to systematically
store and make such data accessible to researchers. However, the
available data, which primarily covers the period after 1990, is
incomplete, with annual statistics missing for some countries and entirely
absent for others. According to the accessible data, 82,227 women
were murdered worldwide in 2018. Figure 2, based on these
data, presents aggregate global values and indicates that femicides have
been perpetrated in a deliberate and systematic manner. Friedman (2003)
associated the rise in violence with the social disruption and
fragmentation resulting from globalization. In response, womenâ€™s movements opposing this
violence have gained global prominence. The complexity of femicide underscores
the need for multidisciplinary research. The literature indicates that femicide
has been examined from feminist, sociological, criminological, human rights, and
decolonial perspectives; however, economic analyses of the phenomenon are notably
lacking. Given that economic conditions influence individual psychology and behavior,
it is important to investigate femicide from an economic standpoint.
To prevent future cases, it is crucial to identify the
causes of femicide from multiple perspectives, implement appropriate measures, and
develop effective policies.
