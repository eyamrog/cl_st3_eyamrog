This approach became firmly established in Brazil, resulting in restricted
access to higher education and, consequently, limited opportunities for social
mobility for the majority of Brazilians across multiple generations. Although
census data on higher education were not collected until 1950,
various indicators suggest that access was largely confined to the
upper socio-economic classes. According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography
and Statistics, higher education enrolment in 1950 was 210,270, increasing
modestly to 593,009 by 1970 (Brazilian Institute of Geography and
Statistics, 1950; 1970), then rising to 1,377,286 in 1980, and
reaching 2,125,958 students in 1998 (National Institute of Studies and
Educational Research Anísio Teixeira, 2000a). Despite this growth, only 12%
of individuals aged 19–24 years were enrolled in university in
1997 (Saviani, 2010). This persistent disparity contributed to the development
of various social and intellectual movements in the first half
of the twentieth century that advocated for more equitable access
to quality education.
