Vriesea altobocainensis is morphologically similar to V. sceptrum, a species
native to the highlands of Serra da Mantiqueira in the
states of São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Rio de Janeiro.
Both species exhibit a robust habit, inflorescences with spreading branches,
dense and distichous flowers, short internodes (0.7–1.5 cm in length),
and red primary bracts. However, V. altobocainensis can be distinguished
by its higher number of inflorescence branches (10–21) and flowers
per branch [(8–)10–20], orbicular to broadly ovate upper primary bracts
measuring 6–8 cm in width, red rachillas, orbicular to broadly
ovate floral bracts 2–3 cm wide with obtuse apices, and
yellow sepals. In contrast, V. sceptrum typically has fewer inflorescence
branches (13–15) and flowers per branch [5–9(–12)], triangular to ovate
upper primary bracts 2–5 cm wide, greenish-orange to orange rachillas,
ovate floral bracts 1.5–2.2 cm wide with acute to obtuse
apices, and orange sepals (see Figure 3).
