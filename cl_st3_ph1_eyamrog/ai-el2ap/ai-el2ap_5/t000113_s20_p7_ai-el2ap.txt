A historical review of female education is necessary to understand
the legitimizing myths that contribute to the invisibility of women
in the context of D&T. Historically, female education was shaped
by patriarchal structures that prioritized male authority, particularly during the
colonial period. Ribeiro (1987) notes that, at that time, the
formal education of women was regarded as a social transgression
in both Portugal and Brazil. Women were often confined to
domestic spaces and regarded as inferior, with their primary role
being the reproduction of male heirs to maintain male dominance.
This resulted in a significant proportion of illiterate women within
the colony. Consequently, the current invisibility of women among students
with D&T indicators can be seen as a continuation of
these historical patterns. The enduring effects of inequity and injustice,
perpetuated by these legitimizing myths, continue to shape the perceptions
of teachers, students, and guardians regarding the characteristics of these
students. Furthermore, the historically differentiated educational experiences and the absence
of successful female role models have contributed to lower self-esteem
among women, as exemplified by the phenomenon of "imposter syndrome,"
in which women attribute their achievements to external factors rather
than their own abilities (Freitas & Perez, 2016).
