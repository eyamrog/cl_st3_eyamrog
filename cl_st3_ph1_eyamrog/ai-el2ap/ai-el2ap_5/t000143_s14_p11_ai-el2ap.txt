Multiple spatial regression was conducted in the final phase of
analysis. The fit quality of the spatial regression model was
comparable to that of the traditional linear regression model, as
confirmed by residual analysis and the Moran’s I index. Variable
selection for model inclusion or exclusion was based on the
following criteria: (1) selection of variables with the highest statistical
correlation; (2) inclusion of variables that, when analyzed jointly, resulted
in a higher F value in simple regression analysis, with
the possibility of including variables from the same block as
adjustment variables regardless of their individual associations; and (3) inclusion
of variables that demonstrated a significant partial correlation with the
dependent variable after controlling for other modeled variables. Variables with
a p-value ≥ 0.05 were excluded from the final model.
The analyses were performed using Stata 11.0, SPSS 18.0, and
GeoDa 0.95-i.
