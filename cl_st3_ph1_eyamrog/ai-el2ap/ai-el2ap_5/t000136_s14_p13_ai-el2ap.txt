To investigate the relationships between latent variables, we selected Partial
Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) as the analytical technique.
However, because the manifest variables in this study are qualitative
and dichotomous, and PLS-SEM is not suitable for measuring constructs
with such variables (Hair et al., 2016), we first conducted
a Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) to identify the underlying governance
structure in nonprofit organizations (NPOs).
