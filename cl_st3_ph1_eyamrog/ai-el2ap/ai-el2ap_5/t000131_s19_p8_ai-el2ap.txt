Morphology and biomass partitioning â€“ The retention of solar radiation
flux and species had a significant effect on leaf area
(LA). M. glomerata exhibited higher LA than M. laevigata at
both 90 and 150 days after transplanting (DAT) (Figure 4).
At 90 DAT, the LA of M. glomerata and M.
laevigata plants grown under I0 was 50% and 12% higher,
respectively, compared to those grown under I75 (Figure 4a). At
150 DAT, the difference in LA between plants grown under
I0 and I75 ranged from 23% to 27%. Additionally, at
150 DAT, the LA of M. glomerata plants grown under
I0, I25, and I50 was 1.7 times greater than that
of M. laevigata plants (Figure 4b). Specific leaf area (SLA)
decreased with increasing levels of solar radiation (Figure 4c, d).
For both species at 150 DAT, plants grown under I75
exhibited SLA values that were, on average, 1.4 times higher
than those of plants grown under I0, I25, and I50
(Figure 4d).
