Seedling length was assessed by sowing four replicates of 20
seeds each, which were moistened with either distilled water or
the test solution. The seeds were placed in rolls of
paper and incubated in a germination chamber at 20 Â°C
for seven days. For each replicate, the total length of
10 randomly selected normal seedlings was measured using a millimeter
ruler. The mean seedling length for each replicate was calculated
by summing the individual measurements and dividing by the number
of seedlings measured, with results expressed in centimeters (cm) (Nakagawa,
1999).
