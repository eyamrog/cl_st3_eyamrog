The initial indication of rigid or outdated conceptual frameworks is
their tendency to become reified, a process that can be
described as "objectification." In migration studies, a prominent example is
the conceptualization of "ethnicity." Originally, the concept of ethnicity was
employed to critically examine the persistent presence of difference in
contexts where gradual "acculturation" was anticipated, thereby replacing earlier frameworks
that impeded the understanding of such phenomena. However, over time,
the concept of ethnicity itself has become reified, treated as
an object or attribute that individuals possess, rather than as
a dynamic process. This reification can lead to confusion between
the analytical framework and the phenomena it is intended to
explain, resulting in further conceptual rigidity.
