Leaf area (LA) was measured by detaching leaves from the
entire plant and excising 1 cm² leaf discs from the
basal, median, and apical regions of each leaf. The mean
leaf area was estimated using the area and dry weight
of the discs in conjunction with the total leaf dry
weight. Specific leaf area (SLA) was calculated as the ratio
of leaf area to leaf dry mass (dm² g⁻¹).
