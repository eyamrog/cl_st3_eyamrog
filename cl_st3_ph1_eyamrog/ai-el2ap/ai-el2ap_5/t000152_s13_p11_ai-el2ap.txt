Historical evidence indicates that public policies alone are insufficient to
ensure equitable access to higher education, improved employment opportunities, or
enhanced quality of life. Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,
the availability of higher education in Brazil did not meet
demand, and access remained particularly challenging for individuals residing in
slums or remote areas. The onset of the pandemic further
exposed and intensified existing structural barriers to the universalization of
higher education in the country. These barriers include disparities in
access to information and communication technologies (ICT), limited internet connectivity,
increased unemployment, reduced household income, and additional competing responsibilities. The
COVID-19 crisis has therefore exacerbated longstanding issues related to social
inequality, unequal income distribution, and the inadequate quality of public
education in Brazil.
