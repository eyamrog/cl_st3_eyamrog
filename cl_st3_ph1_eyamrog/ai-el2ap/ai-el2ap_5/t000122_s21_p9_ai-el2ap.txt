During cultivation, immersion of thalli in sodium hypochlorite for 5
minutes resulted in a slight loss of pigmentation, indicating partial
bleaching of the thallus. This pigment loss likely contributed to
the reduced growth observed in this treatment, as diminished pigmentation
can impair photosynthetic capacity. Similar effects have been reported by
Fernandes et al. (2011) in thalli exposed to detergent and
sodium hypochlorite. However, thalli demonstrated recovery following treatment, and immersion
in sodium hypochlorite for 2 minutes was sufficient to eliminate
contaminants without causing significant adverse effects on the macroalga. Therefore,
based on these findings and in agreement with Holdt et
al. (2014), a 2-minute sodium hypochlorite immersion is recommended for
effective decontamination with minimal negative impact.
