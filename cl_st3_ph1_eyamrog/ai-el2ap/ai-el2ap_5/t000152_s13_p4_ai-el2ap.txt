President Fernando Henrique Cardoso implemented several public policies to increase
access to higher education for socially vulnerable populations, notably through
the establishment of the National High School Examination (ENEM) in
1998 and the Higher Education Finance Fund (FIES) in 1999.
FIES significantly expanded the scope of the Educational Credit Program
(CREDUC), which had been introduced during the military government of
Ernesto Geisel in 1975 (National Education Development Fund 2017). Beginning
in 2003, President Luís Inácio Lula da Silva’s administration introduced
additional education policies aimed at further democratizing access to higher
education. These policies included aligning the national secondary education curriculum
with the ENEM and replacing the traditional, exclusionary “vestibular” entrance
examinations. However, the new higher education entrance system did not
immediately lead to increased admissions in either public or private
higher education institutions (HEIs). In the case of private HEIs,
high tuition fees continued to restrict access. Consequently, while public
institutions were unable to accommodate the growing number of high
school graduates, private institutions remained underutilized.
