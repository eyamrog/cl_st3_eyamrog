This study is informed by the perspective of an educator
with experience in both public and private higher education, who
has observed the challenges students face in maintaining course enrollment
and managing uncertainties regarding access due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The central research question is: “What is the impact of
COVID-19 on access to and retention in higher education among
individuals experiencing social vulnerability in Brazil?” The working hypothesis is
that the pandemic and its associated effects are likely to
lead to increased dropout rates, reduced access, and, consequently, greater
exclusion of students from higher education in the short, medium,
and long term.
