The "U-Multirank" system categorizes universities into five performance groups for
each indicator: A (Very good), B (Good), C (Average), D
(Below average), and E (Weak). This approach mitigates issues related
to grading accuracy by aggregating results into broader categories, thereby
confining potential inaccuracies primarily to cases at the boundaries between
performance groups.
