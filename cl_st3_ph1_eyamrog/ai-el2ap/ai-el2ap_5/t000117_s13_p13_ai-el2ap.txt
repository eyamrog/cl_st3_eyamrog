Approximately twenty-five years after the publication of the report coordinated
by Edgar Faure, Jacques Delors—a member of the Socialist Party
and former President of the European Commission (1985–1995)—along with other
contributors, published the report "Learning: The Treasure Within" for UNESCO.
This report provides an analysis of the state of global
education in anticipation of the forthcoming century and the associated
emerging challenges. Consistent with the earlier report, the authors propose
policies and strategies for the future of education, emphasizing the
central role of the individual in the processes of learning
and teaching.
