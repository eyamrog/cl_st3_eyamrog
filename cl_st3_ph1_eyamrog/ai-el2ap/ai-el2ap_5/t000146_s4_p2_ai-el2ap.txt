Given that the SciELO Network has been operational for over
20 years, analysis of its scientific output in the fields
of Public and Collective Health enables the identification of the
most productive countries in the region. This assessment is based
on citation flow, which considers both the language of the
cited articles and the representativeness of SciELO Citation Index (CI)
within the databases available on the Web of Science (WoS)
platform. This methodology highlights the significance of databases such as
SciELO CI in research areas that address local issues, which
are most effectively studied by researchers affiliated with national institutions
and are prevalent in regional or local contexts, where the
use of native languages is particularly relevant.
