Brazilian nationals continue to represent the largest migrant group in
Portugal. Despite ongoing economic challenges, rates of return migration or
onward migration remain relatively low, suggesting a significant degree of
settlement within the Brazilian community in Portugal (Machado 2014). Drawing
on two sets of fieldwork, this study examines internal differences
within the Brazilian community, highlighting the presence of distinct kinship
structures that shape varying forms of engagement with the host
country.
