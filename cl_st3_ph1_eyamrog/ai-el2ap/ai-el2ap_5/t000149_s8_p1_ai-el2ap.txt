The province of Río Negro comprises part of the extensive
arid and semi-arid regions that constitute approximately two-thirds of Argentina’s
territory. The region’s hydrology, topography, geomorphology, low precipitation, and pronounced
seasonal and temperature fluctuations collectively influence the composition and spatial
distribution of its vegetation (Bisigato et al. 2009; Fernández et
al. 2017). Phytogeographically, the northern area of Río Negro is
situated within the southern sector of the Monte Phytogeographic Province
(Cabrera 1976; Morrone 2014; Fernández et al. 2017; Oyarzabal et
al. 2018). The plateau sector is primarily characterized by xerophytic
shrub communities, which include aphyllous species with photosynthetic stems, spiny
forms, and species with small deciduous or perennial leaves, often
exhibiting waxy or resinous coatings on leaves and stems. Dominant
taxa include species of the genus Larrea Cav. (“jarilla”—L. divaricata
Cav., L. cuneifolia Cav., and L. nítida Cav.) from the
Zygophyllaceae family. These extensive “jarillales” (low shrublands) are commonly associated
with species from various families, such as Anacardiaceae, Asteraceae, Fabaceae,
Solanaceae, Verbenaceae, and halophytes like Atriplex L. and Suaeda Forssk.
ex J.F.Gmel. (Chenopodiaceae), among others. Additionally, smaller populations of Chuquiraga
erinacea D.Don (Asteraceae, “chilladora”), Monttea aphylla (Miers) Benth. & Hook.
(Scrophulariaceae, “mata cebo”), and Geoffroea decorticans (Gillies ex Hook. &
Arn.) Burkart (Fabaceae, “chañar”) are frequent, along with cacti and
various annual and perennial herbaceous species that are often protected
by their association with shrub patches. Some grass and dicotyledonous
herb species establish themselves in the interpatch areas. The dominant
grasses in the herbaceous layer belong to the genera Jarava
Ruíz & Pav., Nassella Desv., and Poa L. (Cabrera 1976;
Walter 1977; Soriano & Sala 1983; León et al. 1998;
Oyarzabal et al. 2018). Salix humboldtiana Willd. is characteristic of
the banks of the Río Negro, and several exotic species
from families such as Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Fabaceae, and Salicaceae
are also common, as well as introduced shrubs including Elaeagnus
angustifolia L. (Elaeagnaceae), Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb. (Tamaricaceae), and Rosa rubiginosa
L. (Rosaceae) (Klich 2016).
