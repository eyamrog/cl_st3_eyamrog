Several studies have examined the presence of enteroparasites primarily among
the indigenous Kaingang population, as well as in the peridomestic
soil and in sources of drinking and recreational water within
their villages. Additionally, research has focused on identifying local areas
that present an increased risk for the acquisition of these
infections.
