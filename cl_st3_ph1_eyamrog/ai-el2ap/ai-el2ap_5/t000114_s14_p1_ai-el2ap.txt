The Parque Nacional do Caparaó (PNC; Figure 1) is located
in southeastern Brazil, along the border between the states of
Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo (20°37' to 20°19'S and 41°43'
to 41°55'W). The park covers an area of approximately 32,000
hectares, with nearly 80% of its territory, including the entire
eastern portion, situated within municipalities of Espírito Santo State (ICMBio,
accessed 06/01/2021a; Coutinho, 2015). The PNC is entirely within the
Atlantic Forest biome, with the study area characterized predominantly by
Dense Mountain Ombrophilous Forest and Dense High Mountain Ombrophilous Forest
(Coutinho, 2015). In addition to forested areas, the park contains
high-elevation grasslands at 1,600 to 1,700 meters above sea level,
featuring herbaceous to shrubby vegetation and rocky outcrops (ICMBio, accessed
06/01/2021a; Coutinho, 2015). The climate is classified as tropical at
altitude, with mean annual temperatures ranging from 19 °C to
22 °C and annual precipitation between 1,000 and 1,500 mm,
with the highest rainfall occurring from November to January (ICMBio,
accessed 06/01/2021b).
