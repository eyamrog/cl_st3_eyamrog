This article argues that contemporary discourses on the future of
education indicate a trend toward the dematerialization of the traditional
school model, which has existed since the global expansion of
public education systems from the late nineteenth to the twentieth
century, and persisted until the end of the 2020s, when
measures such as social isolation were implemented in response to
the COVID-19 pandemic. The discourse highlighting the growing integration of
education and information and communication technologies (ICTs), and anticipating a
separation between learning and formal schooling institutions, was previously articulated
in international reports authored by Edgar Faure and Jacques Delors.
The influence of these reports is evident in policy developments
such as Brazil’s National Education Guidelines and Basic Law (LDBEN
No. 9.394/1996), which was enacted in the same year as
the publication of Delors’ report. Furthermore, the notion of a
dissociation between learning and school is also present in alternative
discourses that, rather than emphasizing the potential of new technologies,
advocate for a renewed schooling experience centered on close interaction
with nature and the protection of childhood (Barros, 2018). This
latter perspective will be further examined below, with reference to
the publication "Demmuring Childhood: School as a Meeting Place with
Nature."
