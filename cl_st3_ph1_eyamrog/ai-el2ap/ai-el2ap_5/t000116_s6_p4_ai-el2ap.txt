The reduction in the overall rate of hospitalizations for conditions
sensitive to primary care (ICSAP) exhibited a slight deceleration, coinciding
with the revision of the National Primary Care Policy (PNAB)
in 2017. Although the downward trend persists, its statistical significance
has diminished. This observation suggests that the stagnation or potential
increase in hospitalizations for these conditions may be associated with
changes resulting directly or indirectly from the modifications introduced by
the PNAB, as reported in previous studies. Since the beginning
of the current municipal administration in Rio de Janeiro, the
cost-effectiveness and actual impact of primary health care (PHC) coverage
implemented during the preceding decade have been questioned by a
relatively inexperienced technical team. This situation has led to the
revision of management contracts, the departure of health professionals, challenges
in maintaining care delivery processes, and a reduction in population
coverage. The effects of this financial and political crisis have
been documented in the literature. PHC has contributed to improvements
in the ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC) indicator, with positive
effects on access and equity, and outcomes approaching those observed
in countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
While there remains significant potential for further progress, the available
evidence indicates that PHC represents an effective strategy for health
care organization in Brazil.
