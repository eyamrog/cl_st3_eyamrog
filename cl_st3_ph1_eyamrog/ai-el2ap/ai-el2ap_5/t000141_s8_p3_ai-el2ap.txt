In February, it became necessary to develop contingency plans to
support the respective governments in addressing COVID-19 within the framework
of the Unified Health System (SUS), a publicly funded national
health authority. The Ministry of Health implemented a range of
measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, including epidemiological
surveillance and the provision of complex healthcare services. These actions
encompassed the period from the initial detection of SARS-CoV-2 in
Brazil to the current phase, which is marked by the
relaxation of restrictive measures and social isolation protocols.
