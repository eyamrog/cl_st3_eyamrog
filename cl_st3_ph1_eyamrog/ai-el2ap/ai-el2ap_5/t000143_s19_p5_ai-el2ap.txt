Table 2 presents the results of the final spatial regression
analysis model. The proportion of female-headed households and the Municipal
Human Development Index (MHDI) were both positively associated with femicide
rates in the municipalities of Sergipe between 2013 and 2017
(p < 0.05). In contrast, the Income Concentration Index (GINI
Index) was negatively associated with femicide rates in these municipalities
during the same period.
