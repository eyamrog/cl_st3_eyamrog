By 2010, the adoption of the ENEM as the primary
admission criterion by most public higher education institutions (HEIs) significantly
increased the number of eligible applicants to higher education in
Brazil (Ministry of Education of Brazil 2018a). To promote broader
access and standardize the university admission process, the Ministry of
Education developed the Unified Selection System (SISU), which implemented unified
application criteria across all public HEIs and extended the assurance
of equal opportunity at the national level (Ministry of Education
of Brazil 2020a). Through SISU, candidates may apply to public
HEIs, while for private HEIs, they can simultaneously apply for
financial support through programs such as ProUni and FIES. Between
2009 and 2017, the combined implementation of SISU, FIES, and
ProUni resulted in an increase of approximately two million enrolments
in both public and private HEIs.
