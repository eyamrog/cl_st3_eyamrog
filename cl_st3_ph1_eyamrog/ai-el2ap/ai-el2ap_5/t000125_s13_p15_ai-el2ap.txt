The Dimension of Regional Engagement (represented in purple) comprises five
indicators. Of these, only the indicator "Regional joint publications" is
derived from open sources, while the remaining indicators—Bachelor graduates working
in the region, Student internships in the region, Income from
regional sources, and Master graduates working in the region—are based
on data provided by the institutions themselves. This dimension exhibits
a substantial amount of missing data, as sixteen out of
the twenty institutions reported data solely for the indicator obtained
from open sources (Regional joint publications). This high level of
missing data is attributable to inadequate data reporting by the
institutions. Among the institutions, ESPM demonstrates the most comprehensive data
coverage, with available data for four indicators, and achieves the
highest performance ratings (three A grades and one B grade).
The Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul ranks second,
with two A grades.
