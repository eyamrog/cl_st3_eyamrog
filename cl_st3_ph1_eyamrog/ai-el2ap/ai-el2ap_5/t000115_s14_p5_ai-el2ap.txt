Following a meeting with the local UBS team, it was
determined that indigenous health agents (IHAs) would directly contact community
members to enhance participant adherence to the study. The sampling
frame comprised 396 students aged 5 to 19 years, all
enrolled at the local indigenous school. The sample size was
calculated using StatDisk Version 8.4, based on the sampling structure,
a 95% confidence level, a 10% margin of error, and
an assumed prevalence of 90% for intestinal parasitosis in indigenous
villages in Paran√°, resulting in a minimum required sample of
32 individuals per assessment. The study population consisted of randomly
selected students whose parents or guardians provided voluntary informed consent
following active recruitment by the local health team. Although some
indigenous children participated in both phases of data collection, all
participants were selected randomly.
