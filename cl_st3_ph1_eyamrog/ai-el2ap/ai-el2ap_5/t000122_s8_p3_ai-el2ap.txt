The genus Bostrychia Montagne, a member of the family Rhodomelaceae
(Rhodophyta), comprises macroalgae distributed in temperate and tropical regions, where
they inhabit both continental aquatic and marine environments, with a
primary occurrence in salt marshes and mangroves (King & Puttock
1989). Species of Bostrychia contribute to the formation of the
mangrove community referred to as Bostrychietum, a term introduced by
Post (1936). This community is characterized predominantly by rhodophytes such
as Bostrychia, Caloglossa (Harvey) G. Martens, and Catenella Greville, but
also includes cyanobacteria and chlorophytes that are associated with the
pneumatophores of Avicennia L., as well as the rhizophores and
stems of Rhizophora L. and Laguncularia C.F.Gaertn (West 1991; West
et al. 1993; Pedroche et al. 1995; Yokoya et al.
1999; Fontes et al. 2007; Garc√≠a et al. 2016).
