The species description was based on both herbarium specimens and
freshly collected material obtained during field expeditions to Serra da
Bocaina, specifically in areas adjacent to the Parque Nacional da
Serra da Bocaina (Serra da Bocaina National Park). All collected
specimens were deposited in the SP Herbarium.
