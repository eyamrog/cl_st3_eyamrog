Therefore, it is recommended that these products be replaced with
natural alternatives, which are associated with lower toxicity, greater economic
viability, and increased accessibility for the population (Volkart, Spagiari, &
Bizzani, 2017; Nóbrega, Dantas, & Silva, 2010). Among the plant
species utilized is Libidibia ferrea (Fabaceae), which is native to
the Caatinga biome and has been reported from the Northeast
to the South of Brazil. Commonly referred to as Pau-ferro,
Pau-caí, or Jucá (Mota, Ferreira, & Imaña, 2012), Libidibia ferrea
exhibits a range of pharmacological activities, including antifungal, antibacterial, antiulcerogenic,
anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antitussive, anti-asthmatic, antianemic, antidiarrheal, anticoagulant, analgesic, and wound-healing
properties. Additionally, it has demonstrated larvicidal activity against Aedes aegypti
and is used as animal feed, particularly in sheep and
goat farming, which is prevalent in rural areas where food
resources are limited (Gomes et al., 2017; Moreira & Oliveira,
2017; Reis et al., 2017; Pereira et al., 2016; Hassan
et al., 2015; Freitas et al., 2015; Magalhães et al.,
2014; Vásquez, Mendonça, & Noda, 2014; Lima et al., 2012;
Vasconcelos et al., 2011).
