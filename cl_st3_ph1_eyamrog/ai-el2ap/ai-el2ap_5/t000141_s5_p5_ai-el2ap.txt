As identified in this study, among the 27 Brazilian federative
units, only 18 developed plans to resume economic activities that
were based on epidemiological and health indicators. This finding raises
questions regarding the criteria employed by the remaining nine federative
units, which either did not establish formal reopening strategies, implemented
such strategies only at the municipal level, or proceeded without
the use of objective indicators.
