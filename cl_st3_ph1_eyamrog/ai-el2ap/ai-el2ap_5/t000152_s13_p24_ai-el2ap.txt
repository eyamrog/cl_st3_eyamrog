In general, most commonly used mobile phones lack the necessary
hardware and software capabilities to effectively interact with digital platforms
or support the large-volume downloads often required for academic studies.
Consequently, the use of social media applications such as Instagram,
Facebook, and WhatsApp for instructional purposes may increase usability but
also significantly limit the range of educational resources that can
be accessed. Therefore, internet access via mobile phones alone may
be inadequate to facilitate full participation in online educational activities.
