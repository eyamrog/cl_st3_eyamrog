For the epidermis analysis, the lower epidermis (from hypostomatic leaves)
was separated from the mesophyll using Jeffrey solution (10% chromic
acid and 10% nitric acid, 1:1). Samples were stained with
safranin for 30 seconds and mounted in 50% glycerin, following
the protocol described by Kraus and Arduin (1997). Microscopic observations
were performed using a QUIMIS Q720 ED microscope, and images
were captured for further analysis. The numbers of epidermal cells
and stomata were counted, and stomatal density (SD) and stomatal
index (SI) were calculated using AnatiQuanti 2.0 software (Laboratory of
Plant Anatomy/UFV). The stomatal index (SI) was determined using the
equation: SI = [SN / (SN + EC)] Ã— 100,
where SN represents the number of stomata and EC represents
the number of epidermal cells.
