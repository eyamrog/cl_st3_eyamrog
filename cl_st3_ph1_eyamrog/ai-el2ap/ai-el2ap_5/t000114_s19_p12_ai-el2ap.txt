The specimens exhibit long, linear leaves that are erect to
erect-patent, with an acute apex and an upper margin that
is serrulate. The leaf cells are smooth and range from
linear to fusiform in shape, and the costae are often
subpercurrent. The capsule is long and pyriform. The samples analyzed
were collected from rocks and soil, which is consistent with
their typical occurrence in the montane regions of the Atlantic
Forest. This species has been recorded in the Brazilian states
of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Paraná, as well
as in Colombia and Bolivia.
