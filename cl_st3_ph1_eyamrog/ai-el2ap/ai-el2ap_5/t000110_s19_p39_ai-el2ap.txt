Surirella sp. is morphologically similar to Surirella terryi D.B.Ward ex
W.A.Terry (1907: 127), particularly in its heteropolar valves and cuneate
valve apices. However, S. terryi is distinguished by a more
pronounced central area along the apical axis and larger valve
dimensions (Ferreira & Bicudo 2017: length 67–176 μm, width 23–35
μm). Surirella sp. is further characterized by asymmetric linear valves
with a rounded headpole and a cuneate footpole, a narrow
hyaline axial area, absence of costae, non-visible fibulae, and a
low keel with alar canals that are parallel to each
other. This taxon was observed in 5% of the core
samples, with a maximum relative abundance of 1%. It was
identified in samples dated to the Late Holocene (~973 cal.
yr BP).
