The significant decrease in primary health care (PHC) utilization during
the pandemic period under analysis may further compromise population health
outcomes. Continuous prenatal care has been identified as a protective
factor for maternal and child health and was negatively affected
throughout the entire pandemic period in 2020. Increases in neonatal,
postnatal, and premature birth mortality have been associated with the
scope of PHC. Additionally, hospital admissions for conditions considered sensitive
to primary care are commonly used as indicators of PHC
effectiveness. These conditions encompass a wide range of chronic diseases
and their complications. In Brazil, there has been a notable
reduction in hospitalizations for care-sensitive conditions in recent years. However,
a slowdown in these improvements, along with challenges in the
management of chronic diseases, has emerged as a significant concern
for PHC in the country.
