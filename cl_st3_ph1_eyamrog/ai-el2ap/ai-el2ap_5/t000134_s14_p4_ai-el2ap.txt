Rarefaction curves and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the
moment-based estimator of species richness (Colwell et al. 2004) to
assess the adequacy of the sampling effort in terms of
the number of amphibian and reptile species recorded during the
study. In this analysis, one hour of visual encounter survey
(VES) was defined as a sampling unit, resulting in a
total of 460 samples collected throughout the study period. Sampling
sufficiency was inferred when the confidence intervals converged to zero,
following the criteria of Colwell et al. (2004). Species richness
and standard deviation were further estimated using the Bootstrap richness
estimator (Smith & van Belle 1984) with 1,000 iterations. Both
rarefaction and Bootstrap analyses were performed using EstimateS version 8.2.0
(Colwell 2009). Species abundance distributions were examined using rank abundance
curves (Whittaker plots; Whittaker 1965), which display the log-transformed abundance
of each species in rank order (Krebs 1999), and these
plots were generated in PAST version 2.17 (Hammer et al.
2001).
