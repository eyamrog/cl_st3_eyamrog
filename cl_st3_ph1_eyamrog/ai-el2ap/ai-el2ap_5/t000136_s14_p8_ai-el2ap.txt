Nonprofit organizations (NPOs) typically implement their activities through projects (Diallo
and Thuillier, 2004). To support these projects, they secure funding
by submitting proposals to national and international entities, aligning the
proposed activities with their institutional missions. According to the "Environmental
Management Analysis 2013/2014" yearbook (Análise Gestão Editorial, 2015), 97% of
the financial resources for environmental NPOs operating in Brazil originated
from donations provided by partners, national agencies, and international organizations.
Consequently, income generated from other sources, such as service provision
and the sale of goods, represents a negligible proportion of
their total resources.
