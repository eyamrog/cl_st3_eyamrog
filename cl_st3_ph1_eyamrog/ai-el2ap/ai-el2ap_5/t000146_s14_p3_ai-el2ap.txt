The selection of these areas was based on two criteria:
their local relevance and the broader coverage of Health in
SciELO CI, as opposed to SciELO Spain, where coverage is
limited to Public and Collective Health. The use of SciELO
CI is significant because it is a relatively recent citation
index and one of the few regional indexes, which remain
underutilized in bibliometric research. Additionally, analyzing citation flows between languages
within a regional citation index provides valuable insights.
