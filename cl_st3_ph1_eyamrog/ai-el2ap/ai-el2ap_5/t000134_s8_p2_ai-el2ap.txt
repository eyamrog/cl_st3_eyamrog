The state capital, Rio de Janeiro, with a population exceeding
six million, contains one of the world’s largest urban parks,
the Parque Nacional da Tijuca (PNT), which is the only
Brazilian national park situated within an urban area. Similar to
other coastal ranges in the Atlantic Forest domain, the Tijuca
massif possesses a complex network of watercourses (Coelho Netto 2005),
which supports a high diversity of amphibians. However, during the
18th and 19th centuries, the forest in this region was
almost entirely cleared for charcoal production and the establishment of
sugarcane and coffee plantations (Rocha et al. 2003, Rocha 2017).
Consequently, many of the water sources that supplied the city
began to dry up (Abreu & Rodrigues 2010, Rocha 2017).
It is probable that forest fragments persisted in less accessible
areas of the Tijuca massif, particularly on the highest peaks
and in the steepest valleys (Coimbra-Filho et al. 1973). These
remnants not only provided seeds of native species for later
reforestation efforts (Coimbra-Filho et al. 1973, Abreu & Rodrigues 2010),
but also likely served as important refuges for local fauna
(e.g., Rocha et al. 2003). The deforested areas previously used
for plantations were almost entirely restored through a reforestation project—considered
the first major initiative of its kind globally—which involved the
planting of approximately 100,000 trees beginning in the latter half
of the 19th century during the Brazilian Empire period. This
effort led to the establishment of a dense forest, which
was designated as a national park in 1961 (Brasil 1961).
