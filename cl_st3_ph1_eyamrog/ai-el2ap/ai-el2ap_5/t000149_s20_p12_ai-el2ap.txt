Conversely, certain plant families were found to be exclusive to
individual sites, as shown in Table 3, with the exception
of PB, where no exclusive families were recorded. In the
RZ, 14 exclusive families were identified. Of these, four are
associated with aquatic habitats: Arecaceae (3 species), Ceratophyllaceae (1 species),
Hydrocharitaceae (1 species), and Salviniaceae (1 species). The remaining families
are typically found in humid and partially shaded environments, including
Asparagaceae (1 species), Campanulaceae (1 species), Cyperaceae (2 species), Oxalidaceae
(1 species), Typhaceae (1 species), and Vitaceae (1 species). Additionally,
Portulacaceae (2 species) and Tamaricaceae (1 species) are characteristic of
open, sandy areas. The arboreal families Salicaceae (3 species) and
Ulmaceae (1 species) form dense groves along riverbanks, which are
often difficult to access and produce leaf litter in autumn
that is consumed by cattle. In the PP, the exclusive
families identified were Schoepfiaceae (1 species, Arjona tuberosa Cav.), Orobanchaceae
(Agalinis communis (Cham. & Schltdl.) Dâ€™Arcy), and Hydrophyllaceae (Phacelia Juss.,
3 species). No exclusive families were recorded in the FE,
and only one exclusive family (Apocynaceae, represented by Tweedia brunonis
Hook. & Arn.) was found in the VP.
