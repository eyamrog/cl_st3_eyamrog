Tropical forests deliver essential ecosystem services, support biodiversity conservation, and
contribute to climate regulation (Berenguer et al. 2018). Activities such
as burning, complete removal of natural vegetation, inadequate soil preparation
for agriculture, and exploitation without replenishing organic matter or soil
nutrients directly affect soil quality (SBCS 2015). Deforestation can lead
to soil exposure, increased susceptibility to erosion (Flores et al.
2019), and biodiversity loss (Berenguer et al. 2018), resulting in
degraded soils that may still retain the potential for natural
regeneration (IBAMA 2011). Ecological restoration is a human intervention aimed
at initiating or accelerating natural succession in disturbed areas (Secretaria
do Meio Ambiente do Estado de SÃ£o Paulo 2014). This
approach focuses on reestablishing ecological processes without relying on conventional
forestry techniques, instead seeking to restore ecosystem health, integrity, and
sustainability through minimal inputs and the implementation of restoration practices
in selected areas known as nuclei (Bechara 2006).
