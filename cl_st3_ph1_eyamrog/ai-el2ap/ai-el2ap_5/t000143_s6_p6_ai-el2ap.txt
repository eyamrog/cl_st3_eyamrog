Matriarchy was positively associated with femicide rates in the municipalities
of Sergipe during the study period. This finding suggests that
changes in traditional gender roles may contribute to increased conflict
by challenging prevailing patriarchal norms. Consequently, the attainment of socioeconomic
autonomy by women in patriarchal societies may disrupt established gender
patterns, potentially increasing the risk of femicide.
