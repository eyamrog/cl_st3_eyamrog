Hylidae (N = 10) was the most species-rich amphibian family
recorded in the PNT, followed by Brachycephalidae and Cycloramphidae, each
with five species. This pattern of hylid predominance in amphibian
assemblages has been documented at other Atlantic Forest sites (e.g.,
Heyer et al. 1990; Almeida-Gomes et al. 2014a; Silva et
al. 2017) as well as in other Neotropical localities (e.g.,
Toft & Duellman 1979; Duellman 1988; Menin et al. 2017).
The high diversity of hylids in South America has been
attributed to the region's status as the center of origin
and diversification for this clade (Wiens et al. 2006).
