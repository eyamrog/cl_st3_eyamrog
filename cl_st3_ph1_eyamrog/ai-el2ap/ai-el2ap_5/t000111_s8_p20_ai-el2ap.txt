If the entire que sentence in (17) is considered to
have replaced the elided anchor as the complement of the
verb disse, it becomes evident that the subordinate clause in
(15) is directly selected by the matrix verb, which is
consistent with the selectional properties of a verb such as
disse (potentially characterized as a CP with DP-like properties). In
contrast, (16) may differ from (15) because ellipsis of the
anchor is not permitted, as demonstrated in (18). This provides
evidence that, in this case, the que sentence cannot be
associated with the anchor position, as it functions as a
standard CP rather than a DP-like CP when a DP
is selected by the matrix verb. Furthermore, the asymmetry between
(15) and (16) appears to be supported by the contrast
observed in (19) and (20) below.
