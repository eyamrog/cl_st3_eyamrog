In addition, northeastern society, particularly in the state of Sergipe,
maintains provincial customs and traditions in a distinctive manner, with
a notable emphasis on the social value of families with
established surnames, titles, and economic assets. This emphasis constitutes a
persistent feature in the historical development of patriarchy in the
Northeast of Brazil. Evidence indicates that the prevalence of violence
of this nature increases in regions where patriarchal culture remains
entrenched, which can be attributed to the fact that more
conservative communities tend to enforce stricter gender norms, resulting in
women continuing to occupy subordinate roles and adhering to culturally
prescribed expectations for extended periods.
