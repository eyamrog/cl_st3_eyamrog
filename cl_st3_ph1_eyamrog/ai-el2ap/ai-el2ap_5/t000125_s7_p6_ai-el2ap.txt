The greater number of indicators used by U-Multirank provides a
more comprehensive assessment of universities; however, it also leads to
issues related to data availability. This problem is particularly pronounced
for non-European universities, especially those in Latin American countries. A
significant proportion of the data is obtained through questionnaires completed
by the universities themselves, and many institutions do not consistently
report this information. This issue will be further examined in
relation to the Brazilian universities included in this ranking.
