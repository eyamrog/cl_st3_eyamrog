The syllabuses analyzed in this study were collected from 34
of Canadaâ€™s 96 universities, representing nine of the ten provinces,
with the exception of Prince Edward Island. The number of
syllabuses obtained from each institution ranged from a maximum of
386 (11.4% of the total sample) at Western University to
a minimum of two (0.1%) at Kwantlen Polytechnic University, with
an average of 99.7 syllabuses per university. Of the 3,391
syllabuses in the dataset, 86.3% (2,926) were in English and
13.7% (465) were in French. In terms of disciplinary distribution,
42.6% (1,443) of the syllabuses were for science courses, 37.1%
(1,258) for social sciences, and 20.3% (690) for humanities. No
distinction was made between graduate and undergraduate syllabuses, as the
Access Copyright tariff is applicable to all university students. Although
comprehensive data on the total number of courses taught annually
in Canada are unavailable, if it is assumed that approximately
1.3 million full-time university students each enroll in 8.2 courses
per year, with an average class size of 25 students,
then the sample of 3,391 syllabuses represents less than 0.9%
of the courses offered annually between 2015 and 2020 (Postsecondary
enrollments, 2018).
