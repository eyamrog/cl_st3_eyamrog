Four binomial logistic regression analyses were conducted: one for each
PHQ-4 outcome and two for the possible combinations of these
outcomes. Table 1 presents the results of each model, including
their fit indices, all of which indicated satisfactory model performance
with high predictive capacity and explained variance. No multicollinearity issues
were identified among the variables in any of the models.
In the first model, which examined anxious symptoms, individuals aged
24 years or younger had a 1.6 times higher likelihood
of exhibiting symptoms compared to those over 39 years old
(OR = 0.6; 1/OR = 1.5). Participants without a steady
income were more likely to report anxious symptoms than those
with a steady income (OR = 1.4), and individuals who
perceived themselves as ill had a higher likelihood of presenting
symptoms suggestive of anxiety compared to those who perceived themselves
as healthy (OR = 2.1). Additionally, participants with meta-worry scores
above the mean had a 12-fold increased likelihood of experiencing
anxious symptoms compared to those with scores at or below
the mean (OR = 12.0).
