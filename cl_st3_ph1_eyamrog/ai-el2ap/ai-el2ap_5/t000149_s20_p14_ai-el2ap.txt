Figure 5 presents the relationship between the species consumed and
their origin. In both PP and FE, the highest percentages
of native species consumed were observed (Fig. 5a-b). In these
areas, a greater number of shrub or sub-shrub species were
consumed compared to grasses (PP: 33 shrub or sub-shrub species
and 25 grass species; FE: 20 and 15 species, respectively).
In contrast, the RZ (Fig. 5d) exhibited a low percentage
of native species consumed, with the majority being herbaceous (25
herbaceous dicot species and 8 grass species), which differs from
the pattern observed for the total area (Fig. 3b).
