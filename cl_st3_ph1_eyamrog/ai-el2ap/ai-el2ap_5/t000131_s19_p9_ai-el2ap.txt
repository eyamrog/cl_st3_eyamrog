The highest aboveground biomass production at 90 days after transplanting
(DAT) was recorded in M. glomerata under the I50 treatment
(45.37 g dry weight), while M. laevigata exhibited the highest
value under I0 (28.19 g dry weight) (Figure 5a). At
150 DAT, shoot biomass in M. glomerata was greatest under
I0, followed by I25 and I50 treatments (Figure 5b). In
contrast, M. laevigata showed the highest aboveground dry mass under
I25, followed by I0. At both 90 and 150 DAT,
root dry mass was higher under I0 compared to other
treatments, regardless of species (Figure 5). At 90 DAT, both
species produced greater leaf biomass relative to other plant parts,
whereas at 150 DAT, stem biomass exceeded leaf dry mass
(Figure 5). By the end of the experiment (150 DAT),
M. laevigata exhibited increased total biomass production under I25 compared
to other solar irradiance treatments. In M. laevigata, leaf, stem,
and root biomass of plants grown under I75 were 38%,
48%, and 70% lower, respectively, than those grown under I25.
Additionally, compared to the full sun treatment (I0), root biomass
was reduced by 54% and 69% under I50 and I75
treatments, respectively (Figure 5).
