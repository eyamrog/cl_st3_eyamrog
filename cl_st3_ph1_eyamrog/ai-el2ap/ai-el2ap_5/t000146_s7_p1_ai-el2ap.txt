The choice of publication language is a critical factor in
scientific communication, as it determines both the linguistic accessibility and
the geographical reach of research findings. English currently serves as
the lingua franca of science, providing a significant advantage due
to its widespread comprehension among educated individuals [1]. However, a
considerable proportion of research from Latin America is published in
national languages, which has been identified as a contributing factor
to the limited international visibility of the regionâ€™s scientific output
[2-3]. Furthermore, certain disciplines are inherently focused on topics of
local relevance, which is evident in several characteristics: a substantial
volume of research addressing national issues, a low percentage of
articles published in English, a predominance of nationally authored publications,
limited international collaboration, and a tendency to publish in national
journals with restricted circulation [4-7].
