The relative abundance of both amphibian and reptilian species in
the PNT conformed to a log-series model, which is characteristic
of communities with intermediate diversity and indicates a certain balance
between rare and dominant species (Magurran & McGill 2011). According
to this model, the majority of species are relatively rare
compared to a few more abundant taxa (Magurran 2004). The
four most abundant amphibian species—Ischnocnema parva, Hylodes nasus, Ischnocnema guentheri,
and Cycloramphus gaudichaudii—accounted for approximately 70% of all amphibian records
in the park. The genus Ischnocnema, classified within the superfamily
Brachycephaloidea (sensu Padial et al. 2014), comprises species that reproduce
on the moist forest floor and exhibit direct development, thereby
eliminating the need for aquatic environments during their reproductive cycle
(Haddad & Prado 2005; Pombal & Haddad 2007). Species with
direct development are frequently dominant in leaf litter-dwelling anuran communities
in Neotropical rainforests (e.g., Crump 1971; Allmon 1991; Donnelly 1994;
Rocha et al. 2001; Siqueira et al. 2014). Additionally, two
stream-dwelling frog species, Hylodes nasus and Cycloramphus gaudichaudii, were among
the most abundant species recorded in the PNT. Members of
the family Hylodidae are typically abundant in small streams within
well-preserved areas of the Atlantic Rainforest (e.g., Weygoldt 1989; Patto
& Pie 2001; Almeida-Gomes et al. 2008; Siqueira et al.
2011b).
