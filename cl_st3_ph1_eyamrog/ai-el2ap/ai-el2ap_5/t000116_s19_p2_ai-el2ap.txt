Visual inspection alone indicates potential changes between periods but does
not provide sufficient evidence to assess consistency. Therefore, we evaluated
whether the differences in means were statistically significant (Table 1).
The average rates of hospitalization for conditions sensitive to primary
care decreased significantly from the previous period to the period
during the primary care reform in Rio de Janeiro (Post-Hoc
p-value <0.001). The average rates continued to decline following the
publication of the new national primary care policy; however, this
reduction was not statistically significant compared to the reform period
(Post-Hoc p-value = 0.504). This pattern was also observed for
specific hospitalizations due to bacterial pneumonia, hypertension, cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes
mellitus, and gastrointestinal ulcer.
