The decision not to return was closely linked to integration
into Portuguese kinship networks, which also played a significant role
in shaping the collective lives of these Brazilians, including their
relationships with partners, employers, and customers. This integration consistently influenced
and shaped the experiences of these Brazilians in the city
of Porto.
