Several amphibian and reptile species of interest are present in
the PNT, including taxa endemic to the Atlantic Forest or
to the state and/or municipality of Rio de Janeiro, as
well as species that are threatened with extinction or experiencing
population declines. The occurrence of these taxa highlights the significance
of the park for the conservation of regional herpetofauna. The
substantial diversity of reptiles and amphibians documented in the PNT
also indicates the effectiveness of the reforestation program implemented in
this protected area, which currently serves as an important refuge
for both groups. The findings of this inventory, which recorded
a total of 74 species, represent the first comprehensive published
assessment of the composition and abundance of the herpetofauna in
Parque Nacional da Tijuca.
