Recent studies have documented the positive effects of primary health
care (PHC) coverage using selected health impact indicators, such as
mortality rates among specific groups, including children and individuals with
chronic diseases. Another commonly used indicator for monitoring PHC quality
is the rate of hospitalizations due to Ambulatory Care Sensitive
Conditions (ACSC), which encompasses health problems for which effective PHC
interventions can reduce the likelihood of hospitalization. According to Macinko
et al., this indicator is infrequently employed to evaluate services
in low- and middle-income countries. Elevated ACSC hospitalization rates may
be associated with issues related to access, coverage, or inefficiency
at the PHC level. The reliability and accessibility of data
in public databases support the use of ACSC hospitalization rates
to assess PHC services, particularly with regard to implementation and
coverage effects, as demonstrated in recent studies.
