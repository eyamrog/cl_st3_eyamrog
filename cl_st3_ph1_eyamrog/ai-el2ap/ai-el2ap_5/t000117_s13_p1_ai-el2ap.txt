In Cosmopolitanism and the Age of School Reform: Science, Education
and Making Society by Making the Child, Thomas Popkewitz (2008)
examines educational discourses at the beginning of the twenty-first century
by analyzing education reform texts from the United States and
Europe. A recurring feature of these reform initiatives is the
articulation of the concept of the “lifelong learner,” which represents
a contemporary adaptation of ideas that have been present in
educational discourse since the early twentieth century. These ideas emphasize
fostering in individuals the capacity to rationally plan their own
lives and address problems through engagement with collaborative communities.
