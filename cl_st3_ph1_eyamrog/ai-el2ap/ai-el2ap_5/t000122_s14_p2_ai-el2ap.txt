In the laboratory, residual sediment adhering to the thalli was
physically removed by repeated washing and spraying with sterilized seawater,
and associated macrofauna (e.g., molluscs, crustaceans, and annelids) were extracted
using tweezers. Portions of the thalli containing filamentous and crustose
macroalgae were excised with scalpels. The removal of macrofauna and
the excision of thalli sections with epiphytes were conducted under
a stereoscopic microscope. All instruments used for handling macroalgae were
sterilized with 70% ethanol, and tweezers were additionally flamed. The
seawater employed in all procedures was sterilized by filtration through
cellulose membrane filters (0.45 µm pore size), followed by heating
in a laboratory drying oven at 90°C for two hours,
with a second heating cycle after cooling, as described by
Borburema et al. (2020). Seawater was not autoclaved in order
to preserve its vitamin content.
