In both cases, the concept of family is contingent. This
contingency arises either because family is considered irrelevant or because
it is presupposed as an unexamined underlying model within the
analytical framework. The prevailing model of family is typically a
Western one, characterized by the nuclear family structure, consanguinity, and
an emphasis on biological relationships. However, if kinship itself is
used as an analytical tool to examine migration, questions regarding
the definition of "family" become central rather than contingent. It
is important to recognize that "family" is an inadequate term,
as it excludes a wide range of kinship relationships. The
term is heavily influenced by Western expectations of functionality. Furthermore,
even the concept of kinship requires redefinition in order to
avoid the limitations inherent in traditional anthropological approaches.
