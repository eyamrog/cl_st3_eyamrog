Although textbooks are not the primary focus of this analysis,
it is notable that the majority of courses in the
sample had an assigned textbook, accounting for 66.0 percent (2,238
syllabuses) as shown in Table 5. This proportion is more
than double that of syllabuses with assigned readings, which comprised
27.2 percent (923 syllabuses) as indicated in Table 3.a. The
assignment of textbooks was relatively consistent across the three subject
areas, with 69.3 percent of science syllabuses, 60.0 percent of
social sciences syllabuses, and 70.0 percent of humanities syllabuses requiring
a textbook. Given the prevalence of textbook use in courses,
it is relevant to observe that the sustained increase in
textbook prices over recent decades has stabilized in recent years,
partly due to the emergence of open textbook initiatives (e.g.,
OpenStax, FlatWorld), which constitute a significant digital transformation within academic
publishing (Fox, 2020; Jhangiani, 2018).
