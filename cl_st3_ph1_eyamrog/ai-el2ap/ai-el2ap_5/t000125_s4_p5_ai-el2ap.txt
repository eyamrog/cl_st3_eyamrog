An analysis of individual institutional performance indicates that SÃ£o Paulo
State University (UNESP) led the ranking in 2017 and 2018
but experienced a significant decline in its position in subsequent
years. In 2019, there was an increase in the volume
of data reported and the inclusion of new Brazilian institutions
in the ranking, suggesting that the ranking is gaining prominence
in Brazil. As a result, leadership across the evaluated dimensions
became more distributed among various institutions, contributing to a greater
balance among the top-performing Brazilian institutions. This trend continued in
2020.
