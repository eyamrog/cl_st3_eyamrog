Between 2015 and 2018, interviews were conducted with 13 healthcare
providers residing in the province of CÃ³rdoba and the Autonomous
City of Buenos Aires. The participants included general practitioners, gynecologists
and obstetricians, clinical doctors, psychologists, and social workers. The study
incorporated reports from a range of professionals beyond those provided
by medical staff. Given that public health teams in Argentina
are interdisciplinary, professionals from various specializations may participate in different
aspects of abortion service provision.
