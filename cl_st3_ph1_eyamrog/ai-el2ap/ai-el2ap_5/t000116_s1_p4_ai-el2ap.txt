Results: There was a non-significant upward trend in baseline admissions.
Implementation of the first policy reform (policy #1) was associated
with a significant reduction in the trend during the intervention
period. In contrast, the modification of the PNAB (policy #2)
did not alter the direction of the trend but was
associated with a decreased rate of decline. Variations in trends
and differences between periods were observed according to the specific
ACSC group.
