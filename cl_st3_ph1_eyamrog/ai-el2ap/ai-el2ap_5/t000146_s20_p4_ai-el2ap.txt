The percentages presented in Fig. 1 were calculated only for
countries that had published at least 50 articles in the
respective language. Based on this criterion, Brazil is the only
country represented for publications in Portuguese. As shown in Fig.
1-A, Brazil attains the highest impact in its own language
when publishing in Portuguese (55.7%). When articles are published in
English, the impact in Portuguese is 47.9%, and when published
in Spanish, the impact is 34.4%.
