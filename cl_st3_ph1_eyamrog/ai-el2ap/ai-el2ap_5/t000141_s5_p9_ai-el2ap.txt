Although some criteria established by the WHO were met, most
Brazilian states did not implement concrete policies for the screening,
monitoring, and, in particular, optimization of testing for suspected cases.
Only the states of Pará, Mato Grosso do Sul, and
Santa Catarina reported indicators related to these categories; however, these
efforts were limited, as only Pará provided a description of
the metric used to calculate the indicator. This finding is
significant because, in the absence of prioritization by the public
tracking system, reopening plans may be based on information that
does not accurately reflect the epidemiological situation within each state.
