A relative clause is a nominal modifier that forms part
of a complex determiner phrase (DP) (Chierchia, 2003) and was
initially analyzed as being right-adjoined to the noun (Chomsky, 1977);
however, more recent analyses have proposed that relative clauses function
as complements of the determiner within the complex DP (Kayne,
1994).
