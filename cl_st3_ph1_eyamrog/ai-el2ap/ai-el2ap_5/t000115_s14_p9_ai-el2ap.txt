Following the initial collection of fecal samples (Initial Examination), a
single control intervention comprising two antiparasitic treatments was implemented among
school-age children. Albendazole (ABZ), a carbamatobenzimidazole compound with both anthelmintic
and anti-protozoan properties, was selected for the treatment of intestinal
and tissue parasites. Each participant received a 400 mg dose
of ABZ, administered by the local UBS health team in
two separate doses with a 90-day interval, in accordance with
the protocol established by the Litoral Sul DSEI for the
control of general parasitic infections. Treatment coverage was comprehensive, with
all children enrolled in the study receiving the medication. Thirty
days after the administration of the second ABZ dose, a
second round of stool sample collection (2nd Examination) was conducted
among the students.
