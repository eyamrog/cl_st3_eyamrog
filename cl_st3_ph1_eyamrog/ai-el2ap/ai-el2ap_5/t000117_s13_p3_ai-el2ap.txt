Popkewitz notes that in contemporary discourse, expectations regarding online learning
are articulated by authors across a range of political perspectives.
He cites Maeroff (2003), author of *A Classroom of One:
How Online Learning is Changing Our Schools and Colleges*, who
views online learning as an opportunity to transcend geographical boundaries,
reduce provincialism, and realize the goal of personalized instruction. In
contrast, Hargreaves (2003) is presented as representing a different political
stance, suggesting that the emergence of a learning society enables
the development of cosmopolitan identities in children, fosters tolerance toward
racial and gender differences, encourages engagement with other cultures, and
promotes a sense of responsibility for the inclusion of marginalized
groups.
