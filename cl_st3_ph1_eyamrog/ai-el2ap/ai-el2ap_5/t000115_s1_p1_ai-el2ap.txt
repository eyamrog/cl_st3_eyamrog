The high prevalence of intestinal parasites among indigenous populations is
influenced by environmental and socio-cultural factors and remains an under-addressed
public health issue. Mass administration of broad-spectrum antiparasitic drugs is
implemented to decrease both the prevalence and intensity of these
infections. This study assessed the prevalence of intestinal parasites in
schoolchildren from an indigenous Guarani village before and after mass
treatment with albendazole. In the initial phase, 81.4% of stool
samples tested positive for enteroparasites, while in the subsequent phase,
following two doses of albendazole, 87.5% of samples were positive.
Although the prevalence of certain helminth infections decreased post-treatment, several
parasites continued to be frequently detected, indicating a shift in
the epidemiological profile of these diseases within the population. Overall,
the prevalence of intestinal parasites among indigenous schoolchildren remained high
despite mass treatment with albendazole.
