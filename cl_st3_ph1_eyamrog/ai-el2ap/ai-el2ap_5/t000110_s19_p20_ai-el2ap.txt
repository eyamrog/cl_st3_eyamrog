Gomphonema pseudosphaerophorum H. Kobayasi exhibits slightly narrower valves compared to
Gomphonema sphaerophorum Ehrenberg (1845: 78; Tyree & Vaccarino 2016), with
valve widths of 8.1–9.4 µm and 12.8–13.2 µm, respectively. Furthermore,
G. pseudosphaerophorum is characterized by dimly punctate striae that radiate
across the entire valve, whereas G. sphaerophorum displays nearly parallel
striae at the central region of the valve, which become
radiate toward the apices. Representative specimens of G. pseudosphaerophorum were
rare, occurring in only 2% of the core samples and
reaching a maximum relative abundance of 1%. This species was
identified in samples corresponding to the Late Holocene (~456 calibrated
years BP). The present study constitutes the first documented record
of this species in Brazil.
