In contexts lacking a mandatory disclosure regime for information on
non-profit organization (NPO) governance, donors may obtain such information by
incorporating governance-related requirements into their project support calls (Lacruz et
al., 2019) or through the voluntary disclosure of governance information
by the NPOs themselves.
