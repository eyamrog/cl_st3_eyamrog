To verify that the series identified as having unit roots
by the nonlinear unit root tests (Table 3) are integrated
of order one (I(1)), the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Phillips-Perron
(PP) tests were conducted on their first differences (Table 4).
After establishing the stationarity of the series at the first
difference, cointegration tests were subsequently performed.
