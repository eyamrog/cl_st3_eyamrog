It is important to acknowledge and incentivize the scientific contributions
of research communities that focus on local or regional issues,
in order to achieve a more equitable distribution of publications
across different languages. The integration of regional citation indexes into
comprehensive platforms such as the Web of Science enhances the
visibility and inclusion of this knowledge within the global scientific
discourse, while also promoting linguistic accessibility for local and regional
audiences.
