The data obtained in this study indicate that the semiarid
livestock fields of the Middle Valley of the RÃ­o Negro
preserve native vegetation characteristic of the Monte ecoregion. The Asteraceae
family accounts for the highest species richness (60 species), followed
by Poaceae (47 species), Fabaceae (26 species), Solanaceae (18 species),
Verbenaceae (12 species), and Chenopodiaceae (10 species). Overall, 72% of
native species are consumed by cattle, while 66% of exotic
species are classified as toxic or potentially toxic. The introduction
of exotic species is primarily restricted to areas experiencing higher
levels of disturbance, such as those affected by maintenance activities
or vehicular traffic, with this pattern being particularly pronounced in
the Riparian Zone.
