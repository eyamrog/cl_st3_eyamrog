Data were presented as mean values ± standard deviation and
as frequency percentages (%) using SigmaPlot software (Systat Software, Inc.,
version 12.0). Following assessment of parametric assumptions and statistical differences
among experimental groups for the variables studied, comparative analyses were
conducted between microorganisms and both the decoction and extract, as
well as among the different concentrations applied to the decoction
and extract, using one-way ANOVA and repeated measures one-way ANOVA,
respectively, with Tukey’s post hoc test. Nonparametric data were analyzed
using the Kruskal-Wallis and Friedman tests. Statistical differences in sensorial
analysis scores between groups were determined using the Wilcoxon test.
A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
