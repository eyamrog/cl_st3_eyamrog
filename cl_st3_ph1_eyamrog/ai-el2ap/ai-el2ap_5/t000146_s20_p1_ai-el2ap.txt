Table 1 presents the distribution of research output by authors
affiliated with institutions in countries that contribute the most publications
to SciELO CI journals. For countries that are part of
the SciELO Network, the proportion of publications in the national
language is at least 80%. The United States (USA) is
an exception, with a publication rate in the national language
of 73.6%. It is also noteworthy that the USA does
not have its own journals included in SciELO CI, and
authors from the USA are primarily listed as co-authors in
research conducted in Latin America in the majority of these
articles.
