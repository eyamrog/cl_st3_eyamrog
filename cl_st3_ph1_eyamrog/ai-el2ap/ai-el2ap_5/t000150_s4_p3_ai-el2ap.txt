These examples highlight that, within migrant experiences, the most significant
kinship relationships are often those characterized by affective, moral, and
financial investment, even when such relationships are not immediately apparent.
These kinship ties do not conform to a single model;
for instance, individuals of the same nationality may develop different
forms of kinship in Portugal, depending on whether their emotional
investment is directed toward integration into Portuguese networks or the
maintenance of connections with their home communities. Similarly, the historical
trajectory of Okinawan migration to Brazil, followed by the subsequent
migration of their descendants to Japan more than fifty years
later, has resulted in the emergence of three distinct kinship
systems, each of which has evolved and substantially influenced the
lived experiences of these populations. Consequently, an ethnographic approach is
essential for understanding the diverse and dynamic notions of family
that migration generates, sustains, and transforms over time.
