Our data indicate that plants grown under low light intensity
exhibited increased chlorophyll content, leaf area (LA), and specific leaf
area (SLA). However, net photosynthetic rate (A) was lower in
these conditions compared to other treatments, which likely contributed to
reduced aboveground dry mass. In both Mikania species, individuals developed
under shaded environments (I75) demonstrated lower overall performance than those
grown under higher light intensities. Plants cultivated under I25 exhibited
higher photosynthetic rates than those under I0, a response that
may be associated with increased chlorophyll content. Despite their morphological
similarity, Mikania glomerata and Mikania laevigata responded differently to varying
irradiance levels. M. glomerata produced substantial biomass under I0, I25,
and I50, with minimal variation in photosynthetic rates. In contrast,
M. laevigata displayed its highest photosynthetic rates under I25 and
I50, with maximum biomass production at I25. Additionally, M. laevigata
invested more in root growth at higher light intensities (I0
and I25), which resulted in lower aboveground biomass compared to
M. glomerata. While M. glomerata exhibited higher stomatal index (SI),
stomatal density (SD), LA, and SLA, M. laevigata developed thicker
leaves. This increased leaf thickness, primarily due to a greater
adaxial epidermis (AdE), along with lower chlorophyll content and higher
photosynthetic rates observed under I25 and I50, likely contributed to
reduced photoinhibitory effects (as indicated by Fv/Fm) in M. laevigata
compared to M. glomerata under equivalent light conditions.
