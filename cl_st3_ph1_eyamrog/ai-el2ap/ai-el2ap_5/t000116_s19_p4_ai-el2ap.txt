We analyzed the magnitude of changes in trends as presented
in Table 2. The most substantial changes were observed during
the RCAPS period. For the total admission rate, there was
a non-significant increase at baseline. The reform significantly affected the
trend, resulting in a notable reduction during this period. The
implementation of the PNAB did not alter the direction of
the trend but did slow the rate of decline. Additionally,
the coefficient for this period was no longer significant, indicating
that extended monitoring of the historical series may reveal a
reversal of the downward trend in certain months. Several diagnostic
groups exhibited patterns similar to the total rate, including vaccine-preventable
diseases, nutritional deficiencies, diabetes, and gastrointestinal ulcers. Conversely, some conditions,
such as hypertension, demonstrated a consistent reduction across all three
periods, with a prolonged adaptation to policy changes; specifically, the
rate of decline slowed during RCAPS but accelerated substantially following
the introduction of the new PNAB. Furthermore, diseases related to
childbirth and the puerperium initially showed an increasing trend, which
decelerated during the RCAPS period, and subsequently shifted to a
decreasing trend after the implementation of the new PNAB.
