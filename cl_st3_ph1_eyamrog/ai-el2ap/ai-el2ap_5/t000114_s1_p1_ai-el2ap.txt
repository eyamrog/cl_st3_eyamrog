Bryophyta, or mosses, constitute an abundant plant group in humid
environments. In the Atlantic Coastal Forest of southeastern Brazil, they
exhibit high species richness and diversity, particularly in montane regions.
The present study was conducted in Parque Nacional do Caparaó,
which is characterized by its mountainous terrain and high elevations.
While numerous moss collections from the western portion of the
park are already represented in herbaria, the eastern sector, located
in Espírito Santo State, had previously been under-sampled. In this
study, the main visitor trails of the park were surveyed
over three consecutive days of intensive fieldwork. A total of
59 moss species, representing 38 genera and 22 families, were
recorded. Of these, nine species are newly reported for Espírito
Santo State, and 14 are endemic to Brazil. The majority
of species were observed growing on soil substrates, and species
richness was greater at elevations above 1,500 m above sea
level. Sematophyllaceae was identified as the most species-rich family in
the survey.
