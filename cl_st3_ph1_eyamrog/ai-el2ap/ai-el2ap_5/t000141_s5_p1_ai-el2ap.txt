During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, social isolation policies and activity restrictions
were implemented in a disorganized manner, lacking clear guidelines regarding
the appropriate level of stringency based on the epidemiological context.
Furthermore, there were no established regulations or protocols to guide
the phased resumption of activities or the relaxation of isolation
measures.
