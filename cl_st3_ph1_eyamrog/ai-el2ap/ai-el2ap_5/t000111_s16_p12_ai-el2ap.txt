Regarding the wh-sentence in (47), its syntactic status warrants examination.
There is evidence to suggest that it functions as a
free relative clause. This interpretation is supported by several arguments.
Firstly, an analysis of (47) indicates that the wh-sentence appears
to be selected as the external argument of the matrix
verb, as well as serving as the anchor to which
it is juxtaposed.
