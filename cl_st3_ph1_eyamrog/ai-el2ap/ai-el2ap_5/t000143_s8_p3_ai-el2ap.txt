Despite the implementation of the “Maria da Penha Law,” which
was designed to establish mechanisms to prevent domestic and family
violence against women, female mortality due to aggression in Brazil
has more than doubled over the past 30 years (Maria
da Penha Law, Law n. 11.340, August 7th, 2006; Meneghel
et al., 2013). It remains unclear whether the observed increase
in police records of femicide reflects a genuine rise in
the number of cases or a reduction in underreporting, as
the “Maria da Penha Law” is relatively recent and judicial
authorities may still be adapting to its procedures. Additionally, there
is evidence suggesting that the law may have inadvertently allowed
for situations in which reprisals against women resulted in femicide.
In response to the persistence of this issue, the “Femicide
Law” was enacted to impose stricter penalties on perpetrators and
to further highlight the severity of this crime. With the
amendment of Article 121 of the Brazilian Penal Code, femicide
was classified as a heinous crime (Femicide Law, Law n.
13.104, March 9th, 2015; Teles, 2018).
