At the end of the cultivation period, 30 mL of
culture medium were removed from each replicate, and 20 mL
of formaldehyde were added to achieve a final formaldehyde concentration
of 4%. Rose Bengal dye was also added to the
samples. The 4% formaldehyde was used to fix and preserve
the contaminants, while Rose Bengal dye was used to stain
them, thereby facilitating subsequent visual enumeration. A 1 mL sample
of culture medium was collected from the vicinity of the
thalli surface in each replicate using a pipette and transferred
to a Sedgwick-Rafter counting chamber for contaminant quantification under stereoscopic
and optical microscopy.
