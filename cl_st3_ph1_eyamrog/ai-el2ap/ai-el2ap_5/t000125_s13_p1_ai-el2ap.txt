The concept of a multi-dimensional ranking system was first introduced
in 2008 (Van Vught & Ziegele, 2012). Subsequently, the European
Commission initiated the development of a multidimensional academic ranking system.
Following preliminary testing, the first comprehensive set of results was
published in May 2014. The ranking was developed and implemented
by the European Commission through a consortium comprising the Centre
for Higher Education (CHE) in Germany, the Center for Higher
Education Policy Studies (CHEPS) at the University of Twente in
the Netherlands, the Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS)
at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and the Foundation for
Knowledge and Development (Fundaci√≥n CYD) in Spain. The project is
led by Dr. Frans van Vught (CHEPS) and Dr. Frank
Ziegele (CHE). Although the ranking is relatively recent, its adoption
has been increasing. The 2020 edition included 1,788 universities from
92 countries, encompassing approximately 5,000 faculty members and more than
11,400 programmes across 28 subject areas (https://www.umultirank.org/about/u-multirank/frequently-asked-questions/).
