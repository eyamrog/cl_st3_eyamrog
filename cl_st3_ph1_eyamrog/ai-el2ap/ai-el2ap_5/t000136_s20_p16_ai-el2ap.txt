Accountability, consistent with the principle outlined by the OECD (2004),
entails an administrative body being answerable to a higher authority.
In the present context, this is demonstrated by the evaluation
of the Annual Report submitted by the NPOâ€™s chief executive
to the General Assembly or Board of Trustees. Additionally, accountability
extends to donors through the distribution of the Annual Report
to them.
