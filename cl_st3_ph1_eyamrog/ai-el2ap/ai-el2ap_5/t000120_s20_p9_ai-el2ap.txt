Acaulospora was the second most species-rich and frequently occurring genus,
predominantly found in areas with soil pH values between 4.4
and 5.0, consistent with the findings of Da Silva et
al. (2006). However, neither Glomus nor Acaulospora is limited to
the specific edaphic conditions of the experimental site or to
the Brazilian climate. Both genera exhibit a broad global distribution,
having been recorded on all seven continents—North America, South America,
Africa, Europe, Asia, Antarctica, and Oceania—and across four major climate
zones: tropical, subtropical, temperate, and boreal/austral (Stürmer et al. 2018).
Glomus and Acaulospora represent the most species-rich genera within the
Glomeromycota clade, comprising 54 and 52 described species, respectively (Da
Silva et al. 2014; Goto & Jobim 2019).
