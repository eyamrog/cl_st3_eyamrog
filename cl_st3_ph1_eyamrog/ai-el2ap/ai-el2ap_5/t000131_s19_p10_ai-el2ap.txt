In M. glomerata, leaf and stem biomass were, on average,
40% and 48% higher under the I0, I25, and I50
treatments compared to I75. Root biomass in M. glomerata was
56%, 40%, and 70% higher under I0 relative to plants
grown under I25, I50, and I75, respectively. Additionally, M. glomerata
plants grown under I0, I25, and I50 exhibited greater leaf
and stem biomass than M. laevigata plants under the same
conditions (Figure 5).
