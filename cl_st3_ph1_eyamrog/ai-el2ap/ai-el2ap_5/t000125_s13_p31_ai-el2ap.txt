In 2019, as shown in Table 4, there was an
increase in the amount of data reported, particularly in the
“Teaching and Learning” dimension. Data are now available for five
institutions in this dimension, compared to only two in the
previous year. All five universities reported average scores above 1.00
points. This increase in data availability also affected the ranking
of the top performers. UNESP São Paulo State University remains
in first place, although its average score decreased by 0.07
points to 2.42 compared to 2018. The State University of
Campinas is now in second place with an average of
2.05 points, which is 0.01 points higher than the Federal
University of Ceará, now in third place. The University of
São Paulo is ranked fourth with 1.85 points. The Federal
University of Mato Grosso dropped to fifth place with 1.27
points, representing a decrease of 0.30 points from its 2018
result. The Federal University of São Paulo, with 1.04 points,
is in sixth place and completes the list of Brazilian
universities with average scores above 1.00 points.
