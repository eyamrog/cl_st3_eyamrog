The text highlights the conceptualization of nature and "natural" spaces
as inherently educational. It presents children's education as primarily resulting
from opportunities for free play within natural environments. In the
educational approach described in Demmuring Childhood, there is no explicit
reference to direct instruction by teachers; instead, learning is attributed
to the child's self-directed activity and social interaction with peers
in natural settings. The publication discusses the Chilean initiative led
by Fundação Pátio Vivo, whose team of architects, landscape designers,
and educators maintains that space functions as a "third teacher,"
facilitating children's learning and development through its design and affordances
(Barros, 2018, p. 96).
