Based on valve outline, Gomphonema acuminatum C.G. Ehrenberg is morphologically
very similar to Gomphonema brebissonii F.T. KÃ¼tzing (1849: 66) and
Gomphonema coronatum C.G. Ehrenberg (1841: 211). However, G. brebissonii is
distinguished by a markedly reduced apical inflation, while G. coronatum
exhibits a smaller inflation near the headpole (Kociolek 2011). The
occurrence of G. acuminatum in the studied core was rare,
being present in only 2% of the samples and reaching
a maximum relative abundance of 1%. This species was identified
in samples ranging from the Late Holocene to the core
top (approximately 1,757 calibrated years BP to the present). The
present study constitutes the first documented record of G. acuminatum
in the Brazilian Amazon.
