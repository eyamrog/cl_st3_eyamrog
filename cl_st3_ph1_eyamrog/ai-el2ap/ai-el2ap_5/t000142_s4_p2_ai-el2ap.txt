All experiences are the result of choices. For example, as
Erturk (2015) noted, allocating available resources to defense and military
expenditures can lead to the neglect of social development and
human rights, which in turn may contribute to increased poverty
and violence. The resulting disintegration and fragmentation, along with the
destruction of livelihoods, can lead to higher rates of male
unemployment in certain regions. The loss of socio-economic status and
shifts in the balance of power are sometimes compensated for
through increased violence against women and girls.
