The exposure variable in this study was defined as the
occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the objective of estimating
the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the Brazilian Public Health System.
The monthly rate of procedures during the pandemic period (February
to December 2020) was compared to the rates observed in
the corresponding months of 2019 and 2018, in order to
control for potential seasonal variations. For the purposes of this
analysis, the onset of the pandemic in Brazil was considered
to be February 2020, corresponding to the first confirmed case
of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the country.
