The Teaching and Learning Dimension (green) exhibits the highest proportion
of missing data among all dimensions analyzed. Specifically, twelve institutions
have no reported data in this dimension, four institutions have
reported two data points, two institutions have reported one data
point, one institution (ESPM) has reported three data points, and
only the Federal University of Ceará has complete data available.
All data in this dimension are derived from questionnaires submitted
by the institutions, which accounts for the substantial amount of
missing information. Therefore, increasing data reporting is a necessary initial
step for institutions seeking to improve their standing in this
dimension. Notably, ESPM, which first appeared in the ranking in
2020, is already the second most comprehensive in data reporting,
suggesting a significant institutional interest in this ranking. Among the
institutions with more complete data, the Federal University of Ceará
demonstrates strong performance, receiving grades of 1 C, 2 B,
and 1 A, while ESPM also performs well with grades
of 1 C, 1 B, and 1 A.
