In a review of several Sellaphora taxa, Mann et al.
(2004) suggested that Sellaphora ventraloconfusa (Lange-Bertalot) Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot should
be included within the Sellaphora seminulum (Grunow) D.G. Mann group;
however, the available data remain insufficient to confirm this classification.
In the present study, S. ventraloconfusa was detected in only
2% of the core samples, with a maximum relative abundance
of 1%. Its occurrence was limited to samples corresponding to
the Late Holocene (~408 calibrated years BP). This investigation represents
the first documented record of this species in the Brazilian
Amazon.
