Therefore, it can be concluded that a free relative must
be derived from a restrictive relative clause. This supports Emondsâ€™
(1979) claim that free relatives lack an appositive counterpart, although
this claim is only partially accurate. While the evidence indicates
that free relatives are necessarily derived through restrictive relatives, the
data presented in (1)/(47) demonstrate the existence of appositive free
relative clauses. The following discussion addresses the characterization of these
appositive free relative clauses.
