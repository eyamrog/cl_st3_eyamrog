This study is, to the authors' knowledge, the first to
demonstrate a reduction in prenatal procedures, diabetes management, and medical
consultations in middle-income countries. These findings are significant for informing
the scientific community and health administrators about the deferred healthcare
agenda for 2021. Further research utilizing primary data or data
capable of elucidating potential impacts on mortality, infant mortality, immunization
rates, and the development of disabilities is essential to address
this knowledge gap. While the recorded decrease in procedures related
to chronic and prenatal care indicates a reduction in healthcare
activities, the implementation of new modalities such as teleconsultation in
Primary Care may facilitate the reorganization of PHC services within
the SUS, potentially alleviating unmet healthcare needs and mitigating a
post-pandemic rebound effect due to care discontinuities. It is also
crucial to monitor the impact of the pandemic on morbidity
and mortality patterns in hospital services, particularly those resulting from
conditions preventable through PHC, in order to guide and adapt
health practices during periods of restrictive measures implemented to control
COVID-19.
