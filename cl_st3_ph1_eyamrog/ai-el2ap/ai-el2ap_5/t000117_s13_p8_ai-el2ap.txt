Among the emerging perspectives, one notable development is the recognition
that learning can occur in environments previously not considered suitable
for educational purposes (Coutinho & Lisbôa, 2011). According to Colombian
researcher Ernesto Noguera-Ramírez (2009, p. 13), the transition to a
knowledge-based society positions the "educated person" as central to the
production and dissemination of knowledge. In this context, knowledge is
no longer exclusively controlled by formal educational institutions but becomes
a shared responsibility among all individuals. Within a learning society,
a variety of spaces—including virtual environments—can serve as effective settings
for learning, provided that individuals possess the capacity for self-regulation.
Consequently, individuals are expected to engage in continuous learning throughout
their lives.
