The results of both tests indicate the presence of nonlinearity
in the femicide series. For the foreign exchange rate series,
the Harvey and Leybourne (2007) test suggests nonlinearity, whereas the
Harvey, Leybourne, and Xiao (2008) test indicates linearity. After establishing
the (non)linearity of the series through these tests, the stationarity
of the series was assessed using nonlinear unit root tests.
The outcomes of these analyses are summarized in Table 3.
