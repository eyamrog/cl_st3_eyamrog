A substantial proportion of species (46%) was recorded on terricolous
substrates; this is consistent with previous observations that bryophytes commonly
colonize roadside areas at higher altitudes (Frahm 2003) and in
locations with increased exposure of rocks. Although the collections in
this study were primarily conducted along partially open trails, these
areas encompassed a variety of habitats and substrates, resulting in
a considerable representation of species diversity.
