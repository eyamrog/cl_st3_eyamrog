Subsequently, we analyzed the performance of Brazilian universities that were
included in the dataset for all four years under review
(2017â€“2020), utilizing only those indicators for which more than 90%
of the data were available. The selected indicators comprise citation
rate, research publications (absolute numbers), research publications (size-normalized), top-cited publications,
interdisciplinary publications, co-publications with industrial partners, patents awarded (absolute numbers),
patents awarded (size-normalized), spinoffs, publications cited in patents, international joint
publications, and regional joint publications.
