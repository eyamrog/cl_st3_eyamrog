Subsequently, based on an evaluation of the discrimination measures for
the variables, a sixth dimension was added because, for three
dimensions, the discrimination measures did not exceed the inertia of
the respective dimensions. The inclusion of six dimensions accounted for
78% of the variance and ensured that, for each dimension,
at least one discrimination measure exceeded the inertia of its
corresponding dimension. This modification resulted in an improved model fit.
