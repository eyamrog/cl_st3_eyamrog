Based on the error correction coefficient (ECC), the system's rebalance
ratio can be calculated by taking the reciprocal of the
ECC (1/0.044197075). This calculation suggests that a deviation resulting from
a 1% shock in the foreign exchange rate is expected
to be corrected within approximately 22.6 days.
