Since Brazil’s transition from colonial rule in the nineteenth century,
its education system has exhibited pronounced social stratification and elitism.
Patterns of exclusion and unequal access are reinforced by discourses
that serve to segregate and perpetuate existing power structures. For
instance, in a 2019 interview, former Brazilian Minister of Education
Ricardo Vélez Rodríguez dismissed the concept of universal university access,
asserting that university education should remain a 'privilege' reserved for
a small elite (Gazeta do Povo 2019). Additionally, recent legislation
such as Ordinance No. 1122/2020 from the Ministry of Science,
Technology, Innovation and Communications (MCTIC) stipulates that public research funding
for higher education institutions between 2020 and 2023 should prioritize
technology and scientific innovation, often to the detriment of fields
such as the humanities and social sciences (Federative Republic of
Brazil 2020b). This policy indicates a governmental stance that research
outside of STEM disciplines is of lesser importance.
