Approximately 80% of the amphibian species recorded in the PNT
are endemic to the Atlantic Forest (Rossa-Feres et al. 2017),
which is consistent with the high level of amphibian endemism
characteristic of this biome (Haddad et al. 2013). In contrast,
only 28% of the reptilian species recorded are endemic to
the Atlantic Forest, a pattern that is also typical for
reptiles in this region (Tozetti et al. 2017). Six amphibian
species are considered endemic to the state of Rio de
Janeiro, including two species, Hylodes nasus and Ischnocnema guentheri, that
are endemic to the municipality of Rio de Janeiro. Hylodes
nasus is currently known only from forested areas within this
municipality, with confirmed records limited to the PNT (Nascimento et
al. 2001, Lingnau et al. 2008) and the PNM Serra
do Mendanha (Pontes et al. 2015). However, Canedo (2008) reported
specimens potentially attributable to H. nasus from the municipality of
Volta Redonda in Rio de Janeiro and from Cachoeiro de
Itapemirim in Espírito Santo, although additional research is necessary to
confirm their taxonomic identity. Ischnocnema guentheri is currently regarded as
a species complex (Kwet & Solé 2005, Gehara et al.
2013). Gehara et al. (2013), using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA
sequences in combination with bioacoustic data, identified I. guentheri sensu
stricto as a lineage restricted to the PNT, although it
is probable that this lineage also occurs in adjacent areas.
