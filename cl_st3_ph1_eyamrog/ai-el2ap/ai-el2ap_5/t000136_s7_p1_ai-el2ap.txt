Governance is a recurring subject in research on Nonprofit Organizations
(NPOs). In the context of the third sector, governance typically
refers to the combination of internal and external mechanisms established
to prevent the misuse of resources, ensure the fulfillment of
fiduciary responsibilities, and promote the alignment of executivesâ€™ objectives with
those of the organization and its stakeholders (Harris et al.,
2015).
