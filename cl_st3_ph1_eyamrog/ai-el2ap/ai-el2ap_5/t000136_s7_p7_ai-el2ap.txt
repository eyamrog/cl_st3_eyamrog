The external environment, particularly the regulatory role of the State,
can influence the governance behavior of nonprofit organizations (NPOs) by
establishing a framework of external control through the creation and
enforcement of laws (Desai and Yetman, 2015). Beyond the mere
existence of legal statutes, the degree to which these laws
are enforced serves as an additional indicator of the regulatory
environment. Consequently, the strictness of law enforcement can have a
significant impact on NPO governance (Yetman and Yetman, 2012). In
this context, the present study contributes by conceptualizing governance as
a second-order construct, reflecting the multiple dimensions inherent to governance,
thereby enabling an assessment of the impact of governance on
donation levels within settings characterized by low regulatory oversight and
limited information accessibility.
