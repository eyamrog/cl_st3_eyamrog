This study is the first to analyze factors associated with
spatial clusters of femicide in a geographic region characterized by
a predominantly patriarchal culture. Despite the implementation of public policies
to address femicide in Brazil for over a decade, the
findings indicate a highly uneven distribution of femicide rates, with
a direct association observed with human development and matriarchy, and
an inverse association with income concentration. These results support the
understanding of violence against women as a multifactorial phenomenon arising
from the interaction of individual, relational, social, cultural, and environmental
factors. Further research is necessary to identify the specific factors
contributing to the high rates of femicide in municipalities within
the State of Sergipe. The findings also suggest the need
for localized adjustments to Brazilian public policies aimed at combating
femicide, given that its occurrence is rooted in gender inequality
and is influenced by social dynamics and the unique characteristics
of each geographic context.
