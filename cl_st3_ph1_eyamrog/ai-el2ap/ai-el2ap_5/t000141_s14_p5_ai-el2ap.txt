The data analysis was conducted in four sequential steps: first,
a pre-reading phase was undertaken to familiarize with the overall
structure of the documents and to confirm adherence to the
eligibility criteria; second, a selective reading phase was implemented to
determine the type of document, identify the document creation team,
and assess the inclusion of epidemiological and health indicators; third,
a categorization process was applied in which the identified indicators
were grouped and classified based on qualitative similarity; and fourth,
a descriptive and critical analysis of the data was performed.
