The dimensions of Gomphonema brasiliensoides Metzeltin, Lange-Bertalot & García-Rodriguez are
larger than those of Gomphonema brasiliense Grunow, with reported lengths
and widths of 24.0–60.0 μm and 6.6–9.0 μm for G.
brasiliensoides, and 22.0–44.0 μm and 5.5–6.7 μm for G. brasiliense,
respectively (Metzeltin et al. 2005). Gomphonema brasiliensoides was observed in
13% of the core samples, with a maximum relative abundance
of 2%. This species was identified in samples spanning from
the end of the Mid-Holocene to the core top, corresponding
to approximately 3,774 calibrated years before present to the present
day. The current study constitutes the first documented occurrence of
this species in the Brazilian Amazon.
