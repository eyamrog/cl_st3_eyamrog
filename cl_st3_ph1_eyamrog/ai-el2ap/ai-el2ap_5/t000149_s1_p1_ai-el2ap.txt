The expansion of the agricultural frontier in northern Río Negro
has resulted in the use of plateau lands for dryland
livestock production. Such livestock practices have contributed to ecological imbalances
affecting spontaneous plant species in the scrublands. In this study,
the spontaneously occurring plant species in the area were identified,
and their species richness and distribution were assessed. Native species
were evaluated in relation to their suitability for cattle consumption,
while exotic species were assessed for their toxic potential. The
Sörensen similarity index was used to quantify the degree of
similarity between the study sites. The study area comprised 59
families, 197 genera, and 300 species of vascular plants, with
Asteraceae, Poaceae, Fabaceae, Solanaceae, Verbenaceae, and Chenopodiaceae being the most
representative families. The majority of species consumed by cattle were
native, whereas 66% of the exotic species were identified as
potentially toxic to cattle. The Riparian Zone contained the highest
number of exotic species. The greatest floristic similarity was observed
between the Plateau Plain and the Foot of Escarpment. These
findings provide a foundation for further evaluative studies on the
relationship between dryland cattle production and plant conservation in the
Middle Valley of Río Negro.
