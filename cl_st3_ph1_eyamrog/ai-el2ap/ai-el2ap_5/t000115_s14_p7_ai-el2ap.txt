An initial coproparasitological examination was conducted in November 2018, followed
by a monitoring examination in May 2019, to assess the
effectiveness of the implemented control measure. One stool sample per
participant was collected and analyzed using three parasitological methods: (1)
the direct method, in which samples were processed with saline
solution to minimize the loss of Blastocystis hominis species; (2)
flotation after centrifugation in zinc sulfate solution; and (3) spontaneous
sedimentation in water. All slides were examined by an experienced
microscopist at 10X and 40X magnification.
