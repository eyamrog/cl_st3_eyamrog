This hypothesis is based on the premise that the political,
legal, and regulatory system (Jensen, 1993), as administered by the
State, facilitates the ability of nonprofit organizations (NPOs) to fulfill
their social functions and maintain a favorable reputation. Consequently, donors
are more likely to allocate resources to NPOs that possess
relevant certifications, as these certifications typically require compliance with additional
standards. The funding of NPOs is characterized by volatility due
to its reliance on external donors (Verbruggen et al., 2011).
This dependency motivates NPOs to obtain certifications, which serve as
indicators of sound management practices and are used to enhance
their image and credibility among donors. Empirical evidence from Feng
et al. (2016) and Desai and Yetman (2015) indicates that
certifications and legal requirements are positively associated with increased donation
levels. Conversely, Lee (2016) finds that state regulation does not
significantly influence the adoption of good governance policies by NPOs,
suggesting that mandatory reporting and registration requirements have limited impact
on governance practices. The following section outlines the methodological procedures
employed in this study.
