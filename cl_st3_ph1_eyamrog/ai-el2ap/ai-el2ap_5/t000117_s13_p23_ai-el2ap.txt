In a context characterized by instability and unpredictability, where the
future can no longer be regarded as the predictable outcome
of linear and continuous development, there is increasing uncertainty regarding
which knowledge and competencies will be relevant for students completing
basic education. Consequently, educational efforts are increasingly focused on fostering
in children the dispositions and capacities necessary to acquire essential
skills as they emerge. Given these conditions, there is growing
doubt about the adequacy of current school structures to effectively
prepare individuals for future citizenship.
