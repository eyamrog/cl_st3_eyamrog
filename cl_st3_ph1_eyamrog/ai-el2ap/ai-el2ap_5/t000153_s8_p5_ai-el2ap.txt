In recent years, at least fifteen young women from low-income
backgrounds have faced criminal charges for allegedly undergoing abortions (Centro
de Estudios Legales y Sociales, CELS, 2017). Conscientious objection is
common in healthcare institutions and, in some cases, is adopted
collectively by entire departments, which constitutes a significant barrier to
the provision of abortion services. The presence of healthcare professionals
who are conscientious objectors contributes to the stigmatization of abortion
and reinforces the perception that abortion is prohibited (Fiala and
Arthur, 2014; Morán Faúndes and Peñas Defagó, 2016).
