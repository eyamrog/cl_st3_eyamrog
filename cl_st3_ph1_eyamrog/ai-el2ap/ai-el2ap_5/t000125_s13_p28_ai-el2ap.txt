The performance of each individual Brazilian institution was analyzed for
each year within the study period. To assess overall institutional
performance, the average score across all Dimensions was used as
the primary metric for university classification, rather than the “Olympic
Medals Table” approach employed by U-Multirank, which considers only the
number of A scores. Tables 2 to 5 present the
performance data for each Brazilian university from 2017 to 2020.
These tables report the average of all Indicators, the average
of the Indicators within each Dimension, and the average across
all Dimensions, based on all available data.
