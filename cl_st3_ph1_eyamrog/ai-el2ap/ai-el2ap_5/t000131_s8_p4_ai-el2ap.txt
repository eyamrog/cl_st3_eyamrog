The objective of this study was to assess the morpho-physiological
performance of two Mikania species, Mikania glomerata and Mikania laevigata,
under four levels of solar radiation retention: full sun (I0),
and 25% (I25), 50% (I50), and 75% (I75) reduction in
solar radiation flux. The primary hypothesis is that both Mikania
species will exhibit improved photosynthetic activity and increased biomass production
under higher radiation levels.
