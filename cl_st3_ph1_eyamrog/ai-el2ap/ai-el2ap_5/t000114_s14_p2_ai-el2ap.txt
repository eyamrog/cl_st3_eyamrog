Authorization for specimen collection was granted by the Instituto Chico
Mendes de Conservação da Biodiversidade (permit number 47090-4). Data collection
was conducted over three days in May 2015 along the
main access road to the camps, which is 9 km
long, partially paved, and accessible by car, as well as
on hiking trails leading to the “Aurélio” and “Sete Pilões”
waterfalls, which are narrow, of moderate difficulty, and measure 1000
m and 210 m in length, respectively (ICMBio accessed 12/02/2020a).
The objective of the collection was to document species diversity
at each site; therefore, exhaustive sampling was not performed, and
duplicate specimens from the same site were intentionally avoided. Plants
were collected manually or with a spatula from all available
substrates, resulting in a total of 125 samples. Samples were
stored in paper bags following the methodology of Yano (1984),
and environmental data such as sun exposure and geographic coordinates
were recorded. Substrate classification followed Robbins (1952) with modifications: corticicolous
(on trunks or living branches), epixylous (on trunks, fallen branches,
or leaves), epiphyllous (on leaves), rupicolous (on rocks), terricolous (on
soil), and others (e.g., termite mounds, anthropogenic substrates). Identification was
based on specialized literature, including Reese (1993), Sharp et al.
(1994), Buck (1998), Gradstein et al. (2001), Vaz-Imbassahy et al.
(2008), Peralta & Yano (2010), Costa et al. (2010), and
Costa (2015). Moss classification followed Goffinet et al. (2009), except
for the Sematophyllaceae family, which followed Carvalho-Silva et al. (2017).
Taxon names were verified and updated using the Tropicos® database
(Tropicos 2015). Information on global and Brazilian state distributions, as
well as phytogeographic domains, was obtained from Flora do Brasil
2020 (2021) and cross-checked with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility
(GBIF 2021) and Splink (Splink 2021) databases, considering only records
identified by specialists and with more than one collection. Data
on conservation status and endemism were sourced from relevant literature
(Yano & Peralta 2007; Martinelli & Moraes 2013; Flora do
Brasil 2020 2021).
