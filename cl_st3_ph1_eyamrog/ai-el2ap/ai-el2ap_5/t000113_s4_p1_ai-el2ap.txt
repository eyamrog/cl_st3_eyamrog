Legitimizing myths that support stratified social hierarchies exert influence at
a subconscious level because they are collectively shared among group
members and within society at large (Moscovici, 1984). Within educational
settings, schooling operates within a stratified social structure, where ineffective
practices are often maintained by both teachers and students despite
evidence of their limited success (Acosta, 2019). Consequently, teachers may
lack awareness of the extent to which these myths contribute
to the maintenance of existing social arrangements (Milner & Laughter,
2015).
