Our findings indicate greater moss diversity and a higher number
of families exclusive to a single altitudinal zone between 1,500
m and 2,100 m. Similar patterns have been observed in
other remnants of the Atlantic Forest, such as in Rio
de Janeiro (Costa & Lima 2005), Serra de Ibitipoca (Siviero
2010), a transitional area with the Cerrado in Serra do
Cipó (Yano & Peralta 2011), and northern São Paulo (Visnadi
2005). The diversity of microhabitats and microclimates in these regions
supports the establishment of high bryophyte richness (Costa & Lima
2005). Continued research in this domain is necessary, particularly in
Espírito Santo State, which contains a variety of environments that
remain insufficiently studied. The significance of the present data for
the state is evidenced by the high number of new
records and the consequent expansion of knowledge regarding this group.
In the case of PNC, it is essential to conduct
surveys of liverworts, which are also expected to exhibit considerable
taxonomic richness. Furthermore, ongoing taxonomic revisions, species lists, and reports
of new occurrences are required and should be regularly updated.
Such efforts will facilitate the identification of new research questions,
contribute to the understanding of bryophyte diversity, and support the
conservation of the Atlantic Forest and its remaining fragments.
