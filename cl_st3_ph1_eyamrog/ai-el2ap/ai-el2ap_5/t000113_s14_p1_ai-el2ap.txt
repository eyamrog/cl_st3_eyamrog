To conduct a theoretical study on the triple invisibility experienced
by gifted Black women, a descriptive methodology was employed. This
research utilized a bibliographical approach, incorporating books and journal articles
that address contemporary studies on Diversity and Talent (D&T) and
Talent Development Studies (TDS). Original publications on these topics were
systematically read and analyzed. Relevant texts were identified through electronic
searches in information databases pertinent to the fields of Education
and Psychology, including PsycINFO, Fundaci√≥n Dialnet, the Educational Resources Information
Center (ERIC, Institute of Education Sciences), and Google Scholar.
