However, the increase in enrolments has stagnated under the administrations
of Brazil’s last three presidents—Dilma Rousseff, Michel Temer, and Jair
Bolsonaro—primarily due to reductions in the budgets of ProUni and
FIES. Between 2010 and 2014, the number of approved student
loans increased from 70,000 to 739,000. This figure subsequently declined
by 62% to 281,000 in 2015 and further to 170,095
by 2017. In 2018, the number of approved loans rose
to 300,000; however, only 24% of these were granted under
new financing criteria, which considered family income and other sources
of funding. Although the total number of loans increased, the
revised eligibility requirements limited access for many applicants. Projections indicate
that only 100,000 student loans would be disbursed in 2020,
with a further decrease to just over 50,000 expected in
2021. This downward trend has had a direct and adverse
impact on the most socioeconomically disadvantaged groups in Brazil, who
are unable to afford monthly tuition fees at private higher
education institutions (Saldaña 2019; Brasil247 2020). In response to the
budget cuts implemented by the Temer administration, young people publicly
expressed their opposition through street demonstrations in 2016 (Students National
Union 2016).
