Nitzschia pusilluhasta E.A.Lehmkhul & C.E.M.Bicudo can be distinguished from Nitzschia
amphibia Grunow (1862: 574) by its lack of lanceolate valves
with slightly protracted ends and the absence of a gap
between the central fibulae, which are characteristic of N. amphibia
(Lehmkuhl et al. 2019: 25-26). Although it may be misidentified
as Nitzschia semirobusta Lange-Bertalot (1993: 149), N. pusilluhasta is differentiated
by its larger valve dimensions and the presence of rectangular,
short to slightly extended fibulae. In this study, N. pusilluhasta
was found in 0.6% of the core samples, with a
maximum relative abundance of 3%. The species was identified in
samples corresponding to the Late Holocene (~2,400 cal. yr BP).
This represents the first documented occurrence of N. pusilluhasta in
the Amazon basin.
