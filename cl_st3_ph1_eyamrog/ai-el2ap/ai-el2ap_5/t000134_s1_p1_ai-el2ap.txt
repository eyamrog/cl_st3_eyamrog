Parque Nacional da Tijuca in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is
recognized as one of the world’s largest urban forests; however,
no comprehensive inventory of its herpetofauna has previously been conducted.
In this study, we surveyed the park’s amphibians and reptiles
to determine species composition, incorporating both primary and secondary data,
and to estimate species richness and abundance. Active searches were
conducted over 460 hours between January 2013 and December 2015.
We identified taxa endemic to the Atlantic Forest and to
the state of Rio de Janeiro, and assessed the conservation
status of each species using international, national, and state red
lists. Species richness and sampling sufficiency were evaluated using rarefaction
curves and the Bootstrap richness estimator, and species abundance distributions
were analyzed with Whittaker plots. Over the 36-month period, we
recorded 3,288 individuals, comprising 24 amphibian species and 25 reptile
species. Cumulative species curves, rarefaction analyses, and richness estimations indicated
that sampling effort was sufficient. Species abundance distributions for both
amphibians and reptiles conformed to the log-series model. The four
most abundant amphibian species accounted for 70% of amphibian individuals,
while the two most abundant reptile species represented 60% of
reptile individuals. Inclusion of secondary data increased the total to
38 amphibian species and 36 reptile species. Approximately 80% of
amphibian species and 28% of reptile species recorded are endemic
to the Atlantic Forest, with six amphibian species endemic to
Rio de Janeiro state. Six amphibian species and one reptile
species are classified as threatened, and two reptile species are
considered exotic. The observed diversity of herpetofauna in Parque Nacional
da Tijuca, including endemic and threatened species, indicates the effectiveness
of reforestation efforts in this protected area and underscores the
importance of its continued conservation.
