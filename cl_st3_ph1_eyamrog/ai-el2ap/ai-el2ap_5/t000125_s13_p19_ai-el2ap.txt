Figure 4 presents the progression of the total data available
for Brazilian institutions from 2017 to 2020. The data indicate
that the percentage reached 44.71% in both 2019 and 2020,
following a minimum of 38.48% in 2018. This suggests a
stabilization in data availability over the last two years, with
some improvement relative to earlier years. However, the current level
remains insufficient to secure competitive positions for Brazilian universities.
