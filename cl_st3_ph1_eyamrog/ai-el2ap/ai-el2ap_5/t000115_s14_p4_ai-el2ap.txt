The village is located 18.2 km from the municipality of
São Miguel do Iguaçu, with partially paved access roads. Some
indigenous residents are employed outside the village in agricultural and
poultry cooperatives. The village is connected to electricity and water
supply networks; however, there are no paved roads within the
village itself. Key infrastructure includes a Crafts and Nutrition Center,
a Prayer House, a school, and a Basic Health Unit
(UBS). The UBS provides daily services from a nurse, as
well as indigenous and non-indigenous health agents, and is visited
weekly by a physician and a dentist.
