MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Understanding governmental strategies implemented during the easing of
restrictive measures in response to the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, particularly
when these strategies are based on indicators and allow for
comparison across different federative units, contributes to a more comprehensive
understanding of disease outcomes by location and facilitates the development
of an epidemiological overview at the national level. The findings
of this study may inform policy reflection and planning in
Brazil and other countries, supporting the evaluation and formulation of
public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.
