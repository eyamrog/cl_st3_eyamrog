Saminathan et al. (2014) reported that immersing thalli in 0.5%
liquid detergent for 10 minutes, followed by treatment with 1%
povidone iodine for 30 seconds, effectively reduced bacterial contamination and
eliminated zooplankton and ciliates from the surface of Gracilaria dura
(C.Agardh) J.Agardh. In the present study, treatment with 1% povidone
iodine alone was insufficient to remove ciliates and zooplankton, such
as microcrustaceans, from the algal surface. The discrepancy in decontamination
efficacy between the two studies may be attributed to the
longer duration of detergent immersion employed by Saminathan et al.
(2014).
