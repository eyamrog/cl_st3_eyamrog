A free relative is a type of relative clause that
does not modify or attach to a specific nominal element
within the relevant syntactic context. Previous analyses have treated these
constructions as determiner phrase (DP) structures occupying argument positions (Caponigro,
2002; Citko, 2004; Medeiros Junior, 2005; Marchesan, 2008). The examples
in (41) illustrate the use of free relative clauses.
