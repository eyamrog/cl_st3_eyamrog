During the studied period, only three species were found exclusively
at the end of the Mid-Holocene, reaching a maximum abundance
of 4.5%. The low abundance of diatom species during this
time may be associated with deeper water conditions and increased
hydrological flow. This observation is consistent with findings from previous
studies conducted in the Amazon Basin (e.g., Cordeiro et al.,
2008; Moreira et al., 2013; Brugger et al., 2016; Fontes
et al., 2017).
