Elevated carotenoid levels under high light conditions constitute a critical
photoprotective mechanism, as they prevent photooxidative damage to chloroplast pigments
and inhibit the formation of singlet oxygen (Demmig-Adams & Adams
1992; Yamamoto & Bassi 1996; Gon√ßalves et al. 2001). Consistent
with our findings, the ratio of carotenoid molecules to chlorophyll
molecules is generally higher in leaves developed under high irradiance
compared to those grown in shaded environments.
