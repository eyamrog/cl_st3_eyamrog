Dioecious plants are characterized by erect leaves with a broadly
clasping base and justacostal cells that are weakly porose or
non-porose. These plants are terricolous and occur in the high
montane regions of the Atlantic Forest, with documented records in
the Brazilian states of Esp√≠rito Santo (ES) and Minas Gerais
(MG), as well as throughout South America.
