Based on this theoretical framework, governance is conceptualized as a
higher-order abstraction that functions through a set of dimensions. Harris
et al. (2015), among others, identified theoretical attributes that may
serve as determinants of governance and treated these as latent
variables, adopting a reflective measurement model for the constructs. Accordingly,
in the context of this research, the observable variables (proxies)
are regarded as indicators that reflect the underlying theoretical constructs.
