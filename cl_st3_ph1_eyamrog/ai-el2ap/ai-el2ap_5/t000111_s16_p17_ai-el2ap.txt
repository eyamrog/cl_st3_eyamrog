Given these considerations, it can be concluded that the wh-sentence
in (47) functions as a free relative clause with appositive
content, rather than as a standard appositive (headed) relative clause.
This does not imply that the wh-sentence in (47) is
derived from a headed appositive relative clause, as there is
no evidence to support such a derivation.
