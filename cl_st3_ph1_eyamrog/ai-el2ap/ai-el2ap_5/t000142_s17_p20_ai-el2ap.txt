Leybourne, Newbold, and Vougas (LNV) (1998) proposed a unit root
test that incorporates structural changes into the model through a
smooth transition mechanism, rather than assuming instantaneous shifts. This approach
utilizes a logistic function to account for structural breaks, enabling
the modeling of gradual structural transitions. The LNV test represents
an alternative to traditional unit root tests that only consider
abrupt structural breaks and marks the introduction of nonlinear testing
procedures. To operationalize this method, logistic smooth transition regressions were
formulated by defining three distinct models.
