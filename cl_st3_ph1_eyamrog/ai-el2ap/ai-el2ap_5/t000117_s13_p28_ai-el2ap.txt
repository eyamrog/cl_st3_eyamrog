This educational proposal seeks to establish its legitimacy through claims
grounded in scientific evidence, as demonstrated by statements such as:
“a consistent set of scientific ideas, generated mostly outside Brazil,
suggests that one of the factors is the distancing of
children from nature” (p. 19); “Some research gives us clues
that children enjoy little contact with nature in such spaces”
(p. 20); and “we believe that science grounds the benefits
of the contact with nature in the school environment” (p.
80). Additionally, the proposal delineates criteria for distinguishing between what
it defines as normal and abnormal child development by introducing
specific terminology for the issues identified. Among these is the
concept of “nature deficit disorder,” which is described as prevalent
in urban environments and associated with symptoms such as obesity,
hyperactivity, attention deficit, emotional imbalance, low motor coordination—including lack of
balance, agility, and physical ability—and myopia, all of which are
cited as prominent health problems attributed to this context (Barros,
2018, p. 16).
