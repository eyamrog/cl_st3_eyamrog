The present species closely resembles Luticola acidoclinata Lange-Bertalot (1996) in
terms of valve outline and dimensions (length: 10–30 μm; width:
5.0–8.5 μm). In contrast, Luticola intermedia (Hustedt) Levkov, Metzeltin &
A. Pavlov is characterized by a narrow, linear axial area
and the presence of 4–5 isolated areolae at the valve
margin (Levkov et al., 2013). The species was detected in
only 3% of the core samples, with a maximum relative
abundance of 1%. It was identified in samples corresponding to
the Late Holocene (~689 calibrated years BP). This study represents
the first documented occurrence of this species in the Brazilian
Amazon.
