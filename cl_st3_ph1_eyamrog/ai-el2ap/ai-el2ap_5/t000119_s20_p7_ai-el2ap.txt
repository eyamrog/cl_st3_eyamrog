Regarding the total length of common rue seedlings (Figure 2a),
exposure to -0.4 MPa NaCl resulted in a reduction from
5.1 cm in the control group to 1.14 cm. In
contrast, no normal seedlings were observed following exposure to -0.3
MPa CaCl2. Similarly, the dry weight of seedlings decreased from
0.9 mg in the control to 0 mg when subjected
to the calcium chloride solution (Figure 2b). In the NaCl
treatment, although a reduction in seedling length was observed, there
was no statistically significant difference in dry weight compared to
the control (Figure 2b). It should be noted that, due
to the very small sample mass (in the milligram range),
potential errors related to human handling or equipment limitations may
have affected the accuracy of the dry weight measurements.
