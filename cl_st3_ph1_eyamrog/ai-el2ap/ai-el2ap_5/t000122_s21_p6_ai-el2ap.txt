Diatoms were present in all treatment and control samples; however,
they were not quantified in this study. Established methods for
inhibiting diatom growth in culture media, such as the use
of germanium dioxide (GeO2), are well documented and do not
adversely affect macroalgae (Lewin 1966; Markham & Hagmeier 1982; Shea
& Chopin 2007; Miranda et al. 2012; Saminathan et al.
2014). Diatoms can proliferate more rapidly than macroalgae in culture
conditions, potentially competing for nutrients and releasing substances that inhibit
algal growth (Berland et al. 1972). In the present study,
these inhibitory effects were unlikely, as thallus biomass in the
control group, which did not undergo chemical decontamination, did not
show significant variation across weeks. Additionally, the relative growth rates
(RGRs) of control thalli differed only from those subjected to
a 5-minute sodium hypochlorite immersion, which is addressed in the
following discussion.
