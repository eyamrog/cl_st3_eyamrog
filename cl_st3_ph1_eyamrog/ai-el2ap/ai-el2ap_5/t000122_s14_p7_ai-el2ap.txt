Thalli were cultivated for three weeks in transparent glass containers
(100 mL) containing 50 mL of culture medium, which was
replaced weekly. The composition of the culture medium and other
cultivation conditions, including temperature, photon flux density, and photoperiod, were
identical to those previously described for the maintenance of macroalgae
in the laboratory prior to surface decontamination treatments.
