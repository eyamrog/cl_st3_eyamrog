Inequalities between Black and White populations can be directly linked
to the legacy of colonial education. During the colonial period,
whiteness was associated with the ruling class and served as
a basis for discriminatory practices, including the preferential treatment of
White women, which contributed to the marginalization of Black women
(Ribeiro, 1987). Additionally, the scarcity of schools and teachers, combined
with a general lack of interest in the education of
Black individuals during both the colonial era and the Empire,
resulted in significantly restricted educational opportunities for Black women (Gon√ßalves,
2000). These historical patterns of discrimination continue to manifest in
the present through unequal access to education, lower average wages,
and higher unemployment rates among Black women. Consequently, the educational
achievements of Black women tend to yield comparatively lower occupational
and income returns (Hasenbalg, 2005).
