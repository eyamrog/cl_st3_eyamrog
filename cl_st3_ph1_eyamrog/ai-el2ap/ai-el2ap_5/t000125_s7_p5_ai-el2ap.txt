In this context, a new approach emerged in Europe, leading
to the proposal of a multidimensional ranking system (Van Vught
& Ziegele, 2012). This initiative resulted in the development of
"U-Multirank" (https://www.umultirank.org/), which assesses the performance of academic institutions across
five dimensions: (1) Teaching and Learning, (2) Research, (3) Knowledge
Transfer, (4) International Orientation, and (5) Regional Engagement. Each dimension
is measured using multiple indicators. This structure allows users to
evaluate universities based on individual indicators or groups of related
indicators, thereby enabling users to focus on the aspects most
relevant to their specific interests.
