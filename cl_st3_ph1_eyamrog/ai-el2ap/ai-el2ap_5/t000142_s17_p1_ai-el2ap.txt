To examine the relationship between the foreign exchange rate and
femicide in Turkey, daily femicide data from 1 January 2019
to 29 September 2020 were obtained from the We Will
Stop Femicide Platform, and daily US Dollar buying rates for
the same period were sourced from the Central Bank of
the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) Electronic Data Delivery System (EDDS)
(Table 1). The dataset comprises 373 observations, which were analyzed
using various statistical methods. Figures 3 and 4 display the
distribution of the variables over the study period. During this
timeframe, an increase in the foreign exchange rate was observed,
alongside a persistent incidence of femicide cases.
