Mikania glomerata Spreng. and Mikania laevigata Sch. Bip ex Baker
are liana species native to the Atlantic Forest in Brazil
(Gasparetto et al. 2010). Both species belong to the Asteraceae
family and are commonly referred to as "Guaco." They are
known to benefit from the fragmentation of the Atlantic Forest.
The Atlantic Forest, recognized as one of the world's biodiversity
hotspots, is considered highly vulnerable to deforestation and climate change
(Béllard et al. 2014). It encompasses a wide range of
forest physiognomies (Myers et al. 2000, Ricketts et al. 2005,
Metzger 2009), but currently only 28% of its original area
remains (Rezende et al. 2018). M. glomerata and M. laevigata
are morphologically similar and are frequently used interchangeably in traditional
medicine for the treatment of colds, influenza, asthma, and bronchitis
due to their bronchodilator and expectorant properties (Moura et al.
2002, Graça et al. 2007, Bolina et al. 2009, Gasparetto
et al. 2010). However, recent studies have shown that these
species differ in their chemical composition and therapeutic properties (Melo
& Sawaya 2015, Almeida et al. 2016, Costa et al.
2017). To date, there are no published reports comparing the
photosynthetic properties and gas exchange behavior of these two species
under different light conditions.
