Femicide refers to the killing of a woman or girl
as a result of a violent interpersonal interaction and represents
an extreme and direct form of gender-based violence. Researchers have
argued that femicide should be conceptualized as a distinct category
within the broader spectrum of violent phenomena, warranting analysis within
a comprehensive theoretical framework. The term "femicide" was first documented
in 1801, defined as "the murder of a woman," and
was legally recognized in 1848 with its inclusion in the
Wharton Legal Dictionary, thereby entering English legal terminology. Radford (1992)
highlighted the importance of naming the phenomenon, stating, "You cannot
mobilize against something with no name." The increasing prevalence and
systematic nature of violent deaths targeting women have attracted interdisciplinary
scholarly attention, prompting efforts to establish a clear conceptual framework.
The term gained further prominence when Diana Russell introduced it
at the International Tribunal for Crimes Against Women in March
1976. Subsequently, Radford and Russell (1992) defined femicide as "the
misogynistic killing of women by men," and Radford further identified
femicide as a form of sexual violence. While "homicide" denotes
the killing of a human being, "femicide" specifically refers to
the killing of a woman, thus providing a more precise
theoretical concept. The rising incidence of femicide has led to
its adoption in other languages, such as "feminicidio" in Spanish
and "kadÄ±n cinayetleri" in Turkish. Additionally, the term "gendercide" was
introduced in 1985 to describe the deliberate extermination of individuals
based on gender.
