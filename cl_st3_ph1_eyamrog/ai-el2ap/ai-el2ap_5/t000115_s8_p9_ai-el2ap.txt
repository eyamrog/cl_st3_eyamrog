In this study, given the limited data on parasitological health
indicators and the effectiveness of antiparasitic treatment among the Guarani
indigenous population, we aimed to assess the prevalence of intestinal
parasitosis in school-aged children from a Guarani village in the
State of Paran√°, both before and after the administration of
antiparasitic medication, which was implemented as the sole intervention for
disease control.
