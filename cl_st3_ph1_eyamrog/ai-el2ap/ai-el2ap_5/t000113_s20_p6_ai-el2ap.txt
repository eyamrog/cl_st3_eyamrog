Over time, D&T education has been provided disproportionately to white
students compared to Black students (Acosta, 2019), and to male
students compared to female students. Factors such as prejudice, discrimination,
and an institutional focus on deficits within special education are
likely contributors to this inequality. This disparity negatively impacts the
educational experiences of underrepresented talented students (Wright, Ford, & Young,
2017) and perpetuates legitimizing myths.
