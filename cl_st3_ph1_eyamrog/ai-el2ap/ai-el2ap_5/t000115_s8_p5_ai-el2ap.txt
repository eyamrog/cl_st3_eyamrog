A high prevalence of enteroparasites has been documented among indigenous
populations in Paran√°, with rates ranging from 67% to 95%
depending on the specific region studied. In Kaingang territories, the
proportion of peridomestic soil samples contaminated with enteroparasites of human
or zoonotic origin ranged from 75.7% to 96.2%, and contamination
of water sources with waterborne protozoa such as Giardia spp.
and Cryptosporidium spp. has also been reported. These data suggest
that current practices for the management of human and animal
excreta in indigenous areas are insufficient, highlighting the need for
improvements in sanitation infrastructure, water treatment, and the implementation of
regular antiparasitic interventions.
