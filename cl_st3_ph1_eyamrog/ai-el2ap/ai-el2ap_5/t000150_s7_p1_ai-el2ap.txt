In this presentation, I will examine the relationship between the
concept of "family," which is often defined ambiguously, and the
more analytically precise concept of "kinship," with a specific focus
on migratory contexts. Drawing on three case studies conducted by
my research group, I aim to critically assess the role
of the family in migration studies. I will argue that
the term "family" frequently serves to obscure significant differences and
functions as part of institutional frameworks that may be challenged
if the complexities of kinship were to be rigorously addressed.
