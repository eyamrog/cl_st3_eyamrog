A page rate of $0.021 can be evenly allocated among
authors, publishers, and Access Copyright, resulting in $0.007 per page
for each party. The $0.007 per page received by authors
is consistent with the typical royalty from a paperback sale
in a bookstore and aligns with Access Copyrightâ€™s 35 percent
administrative holdback as outlined in the Publisher Distribution Guidelines (2020).
This distribution is slightly less favorable to publishers compared to
the more common 60/40 split between publishers and authors under
Access Copyright; however, these calculations are subject to debate and
have been critiqued in the literature (Geist, 2008).
