Sergipe is the smallest Brazilian state by area and the
sixth least populous, with a geographical area of 21,926.908 km²
and a population of 2,068,017. The state is administratively divided
into eight territories (Agreste Central, Alto Sertão, Baixo São Francisco,
Centro Sul, Grande Aracaju, Leste, Médio Sertão, and Sul) and
75 municipalities, with the greatest distance from the state capital
being approximately 200 km. Sergipe ranks 20th nationally in the
Human Development Index (HDI) and 4th among the states of
the Northeast region. The capital, Aracaju, exhibits the highest development
indicators in the state and offers the most employment and
service opportunities, which has contributed to internal migration from other
municipalities. More than half of Sergipe’s municipalities have a low
HDI and a high social vulnerability index.
