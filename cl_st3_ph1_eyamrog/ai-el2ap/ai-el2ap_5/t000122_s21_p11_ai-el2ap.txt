After implementing the decontamination procedures outlined in this study, it
is advisable to repeat the procedures if contaminants are still
detected in the culture medium. For other species within the
genus Bostrychia, preliminary assessments of thallus immersion times in 5%
liquid detergent and 0.2% sodium hypochlorite are recommended to prevent
pigment loss and to avoid damage resulting from excessive exposure
to these chemical agents.
