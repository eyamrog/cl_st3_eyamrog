Fernandes et al. (2011) evaluated the effectiveness of chemical agents
for the surface decontamination of macroalgae, using Hypnea musciformis (Wulfen)
J.V.Lamouroux as a model organism, and reported that a 5%
detergent solution and a 1.01% sodium hypochlorite solution were effective.
In the present study, sodium hypochlorite was tested at a
lower concentration (0.2%) because Bostrychia sp. possess a more delicate
thallus compared to Hypnea J.V.Lamouroux. Members of the Gigartinales and
Gracilariales, such as Hypnea sp., Kappaphycus Doty, Chondrus Stackhouse, and
Gracilaria Greville, contain phycocolloids in their thalli, which confer increased
rigidity and consistency. Surface decontamination protocols for these macroalgae are
well established in the literature, primarily due to their economic
significance (Holdt et al. 2014; Yong et al. 2014; Saminathan
et al. 2014; Ali et al. 2018).
