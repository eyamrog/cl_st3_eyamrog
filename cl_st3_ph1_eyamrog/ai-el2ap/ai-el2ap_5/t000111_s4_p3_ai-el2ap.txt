The analysis presented here suggests that the quem-sentence in the
data appears to be juxtaposed to the anchor, in contrast
to ordinary appositive relative clauses, where the anchor (the relativized
nominal) is typically interpreted as being raised from within the
subordinate clause (see Kayne, 1994). Additionally, these quem-sentences exhibit the
property of being able to be extraposed, as observed in
example (1), which distinguishes them from genuine appositive relatives that
do not permit extraposition.
