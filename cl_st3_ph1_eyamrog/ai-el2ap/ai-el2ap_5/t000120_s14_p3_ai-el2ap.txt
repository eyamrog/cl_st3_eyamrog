In five of the ten plots, the treatment involved the
addition of 1.2 liters per plot of serapillera collected from
the second organic sub-horizon of a Semideciduous Seasonal Forest fragment
at an intermediate stage of regeneration, situated seven kilometers from
the experimental site. Nine months after the treatment was applied
(July 12, 2018), a new composite soil sample was collected
from each plot for chemical analysis, and two additional samples
per plot were collected for chemical, physical, and microbiological analyses.
