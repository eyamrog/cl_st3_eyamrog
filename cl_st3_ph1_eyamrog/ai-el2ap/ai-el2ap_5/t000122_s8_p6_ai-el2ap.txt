In this context, the present study aimed to evaluate the
effectiveness of physical and chemical procedures for the surface decontamination
of Bostrychia binderi Harvey. This species was selected as a
model to develop a decontamination protocol suitable for obtaining unialgal
cultures for laboratory studies involving this genus. The hypothesis tested
was that a combination of washing with distilled water following
washing and spraying with sterilized seawater, physical removal of macrofauna
and epiphytic macroalgae, and subsequent thalli immersion in 5% liquid
detergent followed by 0.2% sodium hypochlorite would be effective for
the surface decontamination of B. binderi.
