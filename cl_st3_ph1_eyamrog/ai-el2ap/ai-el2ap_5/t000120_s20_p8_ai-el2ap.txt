Glomus is a dominant genus in various land use types,
including the Atlantic Forest (Pereira et al. 2014), agroforestry systems
(Bezerra & De Mello 2015), the Amazon (Reyes et al.
2019), and other Brazilian ecosystems (Da Silva et al. 2014).
In the present study, this genus was detected in disturbed
areas with soil pH values ranging from 4.5 to 4.6,
consistent with findings by Borba & De Amorim (2007), who
also reported Glomus dominance in disturbed environments. The high prevalence
of Glomus during both the rainy and dry seasons suggests
a substantial sporulation capacity and adaptability to varying soil conditions
(Caproni et al. 2003).
