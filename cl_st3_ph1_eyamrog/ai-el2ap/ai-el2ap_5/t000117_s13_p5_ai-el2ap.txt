According to Jorge Werthein (2000), former UNESCO representative in Brazil
and former coordinator of the UNESCOâ€“Mercosul program, information societies have
supplanted industrial societies by elevating information to the status of
the primary economic asset, a shift that resulted from market
restructuring in the 1980s. Werthein asserts that the principal changes
in the field of education arise from the adoption of
self-learning technologies.
