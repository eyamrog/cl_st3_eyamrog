The primary argument of this discussion is that the quem-type
sentences under analysis constitute free relative clauses with appositive content.
If these sentences are indeed free relatives as defined by
Medeiros Junior (2014), as this study proposes, the antecedent D
head and the relative CP head are amalgamated via head
incorporation. Consequently, the relativized nominal does not function as the
anchor; rather, the amalgamated DP assumes this role. This structural
configuration accounts for the observed possibility of eliding the anchor
in these constructions.
