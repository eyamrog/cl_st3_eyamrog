Based on valve outline, Sellaphora renata Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot closely
resembles Sellaphora lambda (Cleve) Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot (1998: 206). However,
S. renata lacks the marginal spines that are present in
S. lambda (Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot 2007). Sellaphora renata was observed
in 5% of the core samples, with a maximum relative
abundance of 1.5%. This species was identified in samples corresponding
to the early Late Holocene, approximately 1,322 calibrated years before
present (cal. yr BP).
