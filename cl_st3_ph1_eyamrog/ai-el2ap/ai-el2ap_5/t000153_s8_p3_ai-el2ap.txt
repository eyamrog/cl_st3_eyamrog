Women and girls seeking legal abortion in Argentina currently encounter
barriers arising from both the attitudes of healthcare professionals and
the prevailing institutional culture. These barriers include the provision of
incomplete or unclear information, dissemination of information not grounded in
evidence, various forms of procedural delay, requirements for legal permits,
mandatory mediation by ethics committees, and requests for unnecessary medical
examinations, among other impediments to abortion access.
