A total of 100 g of L. ferrea leaves were
used to prepare a decoction by placing them in a
container with 200 mL of distilled water. The mixture was
then boiled in a water bath for 15 minutes, resulting
in 200 mL of decoction, which was considered to have
a concentration of 1:2 (LEONEZ et al., 2018). For the
preparation of the hydroalcoholic extract, the leaves were shredded, weighed,
and placed in a properly labeled amber glass container. This
container was immersed in a 70% ethanol hydroalcoholic solution for
seven days, with agitation every 24 hours. After the immersion
period, the mixture was subjected to vacuum filtration, followed by
evaporation in a water bath at a temperature of 50
± 1°C.
