Brazilian institutions increased the proportion of available data from a
minimum of 38.48% in 2018 to 44.71% in 2019 and
2020. Although this represents an improvement, these figures remain below
the global average of 54.46% in 2020, as well as
below the averages reported for Spanish institutions (86.15%) and the
top 300 performers in Europe (85.72%) in the same year.
