On the meta-worry scale (Mean [M] = 12.5, Standard Deviation
[SD] = 4.90), 41% (n = 837) of participants scored
above the mean, while 59.0% (n = 1205) scored at
or below the mean. Regarding symptoms of anxiety or depression,
using a cutoff score of three, 36.2% (n = 739)
of participants exhibited symptoms indicative of anxiety, and 24.8% (n
= 506) exhibited symptoms indicative of depression. Additionally, 42.8% (n
= 873) presented symptoms suggestive of only one diagnosis (either
anxiety or depression), whereas 18.2% (n = 372) met criteria
for both. In the total sample, 57.2% (n = 1169)
did not exhibit significant symptoms of anxiety or depression.
