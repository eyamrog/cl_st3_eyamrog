Table 2 presents the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for the
monthly procedures analyzed, stratified by pandemic period and compared to
the corresponding months in 2018 and 2019. A statistically significant
reduction in the overall procedure rate was observed in February
(IRR = 0.60, 95% CI [0.55–0.64]), with a further decrease
in March (IRR = 0.48, 95% CI [0.45–0.52]) and an
even more pronounced reduction in April (IRR = 0.27, 95%
CI [0.25–0.29]); this decrease remained significant throughout the entire assessment
period.
