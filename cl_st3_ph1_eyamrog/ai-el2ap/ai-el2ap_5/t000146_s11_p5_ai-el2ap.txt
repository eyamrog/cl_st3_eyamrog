The importance of multilingualism in scholarly communication was reiterated in
the Helsinki Initiative on Multilingualism in Scholarly Communication[27]. Additionally, bibliometric
indicators are not neutral[28], as the selection of specific metrics
shapes the context in which research is conducted and evaluated.
In the context of research internationalization, English frequently serves as
the primary language of communication. This trend is evident in
the internationalization strategies implemented by various countries[29] and universities[30]. A
key objective of these strategies is to attract international expertise
and talent[29], and the global nature of research can also
increase its appeal to prospective students[26]. It has been suggested
that universities will increasingly adopt international orientations in the future[29],
and several funding programs have been established to support such
institutions, including the African University of Science and Technology and
the European Universities initiative[31].
