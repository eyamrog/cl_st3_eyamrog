Another significant contribution of this study is the identification of
a set of governance dimensions specific to non-profit organizations operating
in low-regulation environments, as well as the barriers to information
access encountered in such contexts. This approach is comparable to
the work of Harris et al. (2015), who examined governance
dimensions and information access barriers in non-profit organizations within highly
regulated environments.
