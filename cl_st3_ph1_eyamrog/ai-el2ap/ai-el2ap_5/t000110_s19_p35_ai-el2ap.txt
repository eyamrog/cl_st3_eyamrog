In the present study, this taxon was identified as Pinnularia
cf. liyanlingae due to the observation that the specimens exhibited
smaller dimensions than those reported by Metzeltin and Lange-Bertalot (2007),
who described lengths of 94–200 µm and widths of 24–32
µm. The taxon was present in 15% of the core
samples and attained a maximum relative abundance of 1.5%. It
was detected in samples dated from the early Late Holocene
to the core top, corresponding to approximately 1,322 calibrated years
before present to the present day.
