During the Late Holocene, 20 diatom species were recorded, reaching
a maximum relative abundance of 45.2%. Among these, five species
(Aulacoseira crassipunctata, Gomphonema pseudosphaerophorum, Sellaphora emilia, S. sassiana, and Lacuneolimna
novagallia) represent new records for Brazil. The diatom assemblage during
this period was dominated by benthic species, which is indicative
of shallower water conditions characterized by low conductivity, oligotrophic status,
and acidic pH (Moro & FÃ¼rstenberger 1993; Van Dam et
al. 1994; Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot 2007; Bahls et al. 2009;
Tudesque et al. 2015). A similar pattern was observed by
Cardozo et al. (2014) in Lake Tota, Colombia, during the
Late Holocene, which was attributed to a drier climate with
elevated temperatures and reduced precipitation.
