Eggs of H. nana persisted following treatment, resulting in an
increase in the observed frequency of this helminth from 23.3%
to 43.8%; however, this increase was not statistically significant. H.
nana eggs exhibit limited resistance in peridomestic external environments, and
transmission of hymenolepiasis typically occurs within domestic settings. The recommended
treatment for this parasitosis is praziquantel, while imidazole derivatives such
as albendazole may have limited efficacy. The observed results may
be explained by cultural factors among indigenous populations, including high
household occupancy and inadequate hygiene conditions.
