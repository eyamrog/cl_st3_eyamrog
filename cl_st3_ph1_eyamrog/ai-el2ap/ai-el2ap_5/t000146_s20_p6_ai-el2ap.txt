In the cases of Cuba and Peru, over 90 percent
of their scholarly impact occurs within their respective national languages,
with limited evidence indicating broader international exposure. In contrast, the
United States demonstrates the highest impact on other languages, particularly
when publishing in Spanish. Similarly, Brazil attains its greatest cross-linguistic
impact when its publications are in Spanish, which can be
attributed to the substantial representation of Spanish-speaking audiences in the
database. Spain also exhibits a significant impact on other languages
when publishing in English. These findings, as illustrated in Fig.
1-A, indicate that the language of publication significantly influences the
linguistic reach of scholarly work.
