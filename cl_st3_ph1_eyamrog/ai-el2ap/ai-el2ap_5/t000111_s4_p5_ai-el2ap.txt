The analysis of Brazilian Portuguese sentences, such as those presented
in this study, provides evidence for the existence of appositive
free relatives. The subordinate wh-sentences in example (1) are representative
instances of this phenomenon. This analysis predicts that the wh-sentence
in (1) should adhere to matching requirements, as discussed by
Marchesan (2008) and Medeiros Junior (2005, 2014), a prediction that
is supported by the data. Furthermore, if these sentences are
indeed free relatives, they are expected to exhibit a maximalizing
interpretation, which in Brazilian Portuguese corresponds to a universal meaning
(Medeiros Junior, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2014). This characteristic is also
corroborated by the data analysis.
