Salinization of arable land due to irrigation practices has become
an increasing global concern. This study evaluated the effects of
different saline concentrations on the germination and early development of
Ruta graveolens L. (common rue). Two types of salts, sodium
chloride and calcium chloride, were tested at five osmotic potentials
(0, -0.1, -0.2, -0.3, and -0.4 MPa). Seed responses were
assessed using germination percentage, first germination count, seedling length, and
seedling dry weight. The results indicate that increased salinity, irrespective
of the salt type, leads to a reduction in both
germination percentage and initial seedling development in common rue.
