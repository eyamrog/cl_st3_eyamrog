Based on the three-step approach to royalty payments, it is
recommended that Access Copyright’s approved tariff of $14.31 per student
be applied on a prorated basis to cover only the
media articles and trade book chapters authored by professional writers,
as outlined in step three. The average amount of professional
writing assigned per syllabus is 15.4 pages (see Table 7).
At the current Access Copyright rate of $0.021 per page,
this results in a cost of $0.171 per syllabus for
students’ use of professional writings in media articles and trade
book chapters. Given that students enroll in an average of
8.2 courses per year, this equates to an annual charge
of $1.40 per student, based on an analysis of 3,391
syllabuses from 2015 to 2020.
