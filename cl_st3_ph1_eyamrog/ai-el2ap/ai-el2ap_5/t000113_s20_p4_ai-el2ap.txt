Many students with gifts and talents (D&T) experience a lack
of recognition within Brazilian society, particularly in the educational sector,
where they often remain unnoticed by teachers, educational technicians, school
administrators, and even their own families or guardians. National data
corroborate this widespread invisibility across Brazil. According to the Brazilian
Association for the Gifted of Rio Grande do Sul (ABSD-RS),
the estimated prevalence of D&T students in Brazil is 7.78%
(Negrini, 2008). However, the School Census of Basic Education reports
only 48,133 D&T students enrolled in regular classes out of
a total of 47.8 million students (INEP, 2019). Based on
these figures, it can be inferred that more than two
million D&T students in Brazil remain unidentified. As a result
of this invisibility, these students are often excluded from the
specialized educational assistance (AEE) provided by schools.
