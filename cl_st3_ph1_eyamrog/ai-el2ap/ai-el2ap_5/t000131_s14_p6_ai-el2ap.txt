Leaf anatomy was analyzed by fixing leaf fragments (1 cm²)
in 70% FAA for 24 hours, followed by dehydration in
an ethanol series according to Kraus and Arduin (1997). The
samples were then embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 8 μm
using a microtome, and stained with 1% toluidine blue. Microscopic
observations were conducted using a QUIMIS Q720 ED microscope, and
images were captured for subsequent analysis. Leaf thickness, adaxial epidermis
thickness (AdE), abaxial epidermis thickness (AbE), palisade parenchyma thickness (PP),
and spongy parenchyma thickness (SP) were measured using AnatiQuanti 2.0
software (Laboratory of Plant Anatomy/UFV). A hypodermic layer was observed
below the adaxial epidermis in both species; however, as this
tissue was not consistently present in all samples, it was
not quantified.
