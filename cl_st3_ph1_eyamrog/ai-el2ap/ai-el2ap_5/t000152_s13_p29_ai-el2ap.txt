In an interview with CNN Brasil, former Minister of Education
Abraham Weintraub emphasized the current Brazilian government's lack of responsiveness
to social vulnerabilities and inequalities by asserting that the ENEM
examination is intended solely to select the most qualified candidates,
rather than to address social injustices. He dismissed concerns regarding
candidates' inadequate internet access by arguing that individuals without such
access would not have been able to register for the
exam (Mendon√ßa 2020). While the minister characterized calls to postpone
the ENEM as politically motivated, other countries, such as China,
opted to cancel their entrance examinations despite having achieved significant
control over the pandemic. In contrast, the Brazilian Ministry of
Education has allowed the ENEM, originally designed to reduce educational
exclusion, to function in a manner that may exacerbate social
inequality.
