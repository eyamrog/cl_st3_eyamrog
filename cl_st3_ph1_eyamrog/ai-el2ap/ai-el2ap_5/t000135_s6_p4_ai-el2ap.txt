Among the health conditions that require continuous care at the
primary health care (PHC) level, prenatal care, diabetes, and hypertension
are particularly significant. In December 2019, the Ministry of Health
initiated a reform of the Brazilian PHC system with the
objective of improving access and efficiency. As part of this
reform, a set of indicators was introduced and linked to
a pay-for-performance (P4P) scheme designed to monitor these conditions. However,
due to an initial transitional rule between different payment models
and the subsequent declaration of a pandemic in the country,
the financial resources associated with the P4P program were fully
maintained, and PHC providers were exempted from reporting indicator results.
These circumstances highlight the substantial challenges faced by the Brazilian
PHC model in ensuring the quality of services provided. The
data presented in this study support the observation that achieving
improved outcomes remains difficult, and the context of the pandemic
has further exacerbated these challenges.
