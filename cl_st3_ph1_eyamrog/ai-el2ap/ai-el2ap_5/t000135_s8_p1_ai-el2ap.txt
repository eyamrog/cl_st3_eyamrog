Since 2019, the coronavirus pandemic has significantly impacted global health
systems and the organization of health services. The first case
of COVID-19 in Brazil was reported in February 2020, and
by December of the same year, nearly 200,000 deaths and
approximately 8 million confirmed cases had been recorded. The literature
extensively documents the challenges faced by health systems worldwide in
managing the consequences of the pandemic, with limitations extending beyond
the treatment of COVID-19 cases to include difficulties in addressing
other healthcare needs of the population.
