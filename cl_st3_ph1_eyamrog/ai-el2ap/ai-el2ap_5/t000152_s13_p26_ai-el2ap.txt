The disruption of class schedules, the cancellation or extension of
academic semesters in public higher education institutions (HEIs), the suspension
of internship activities in both public and private HEIs, and
various other uncertainties resulting from the pandemic have had significant
adverse effects on students. The necessity to cope with illness,
bereavement, and social isolation has led to considerable psycho-emotional impacts,
as students experienced changes to their daily routines and, in
some cases, were required to assume additional family responsibilities while
managing grief (Sahu 2020; Vieira 2020).
