The next step of this research involves an individual analysis
of the performance of the 20 Brazilian universities included in
the 2020 edition of the ranking, utilizing the graphical format
presented in Figure 1. The objective is to provide an
initial assessment of the performance of Brazilian universities in 2020,
which will subsequently be expanded to cover the period from
2017 to 2020. This analysis builds upon the work of
Morandin et al. (2020), who compared the results obtained from
“U-Multirank” with those from the Ranking Universitário Folha in 2020.
The outcomes for these universities are presented in Figure 2.
