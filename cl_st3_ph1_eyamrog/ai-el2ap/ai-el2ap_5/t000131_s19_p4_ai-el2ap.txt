Diurnal patterns of chlorophyll a fluorescence showed that, in both
species, Fv/Fm values were consistently higher under high shading conditions
(I75) compared to all other treatments (Figure 2). At 60
and 90 days after transplanting (DAT), only plants grown under
full sunlight (I0) exhibited a reduced Fv/Fm ratio, with values
below 0.75, which is indicative of dynamic photoinhibition (Figure 2a–d).
At 120 and 150 DAT, a reduction in Fv/Fm was
observed across all treatments except I75 (Figure 2e–h). Recovery of
Fv/Fm was generally observed at 18:00 hours; however, this recovery
was not evident in M. glomerata plants under I0 and
I25, nor in M. laevigata under I0 at 150 DAT,
suggesting a lower rate of recovery in these cases. Across
all treatments, the lowest Fv/Fm values occurred between 12:00 and
16:00 hours in plants exposed to full sunlight (Figure 2).
