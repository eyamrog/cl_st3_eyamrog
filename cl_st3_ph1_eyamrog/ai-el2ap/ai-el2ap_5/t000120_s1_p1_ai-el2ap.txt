Natural areas with high biological diversity are increasingly being degraded
due to land conversion for various human uses. Ecological restoration
through litter transposition has been proposed as a strategy to
reestablish ecological processes and potentially enhance microbial communities. This study
aimed to evaluate the influence of forest litter on the
community of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in a natural regeneration
area in Cabreúva, São Paulo State, Brazil. Ten plots were
established, with five serving as controls and five receiving litter
transposition treatment. Soil samples were collected during two distinct periods
and analyzed for physical, chemical, and microbiological properties. The results
indicated that the local edaphic conditions are suitable for the
presence of AMF; however, the addition of transposed organic matter
did not increase AMF species richness nor facilitate plant species
colonization. In contrast, gravimetric soil moisture and the presence of
grasses may have influenced AMF species richness.
