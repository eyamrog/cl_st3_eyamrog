Our data indicate that M. glomerata and M. laevigata plants
grown under conditions with up to 50% reduction in solar
radiation flux exhibited higher net photosynthetic rates (A) compared to
plants grown under I75. The lower A observed under I75
is likely attributable to a combination of factors, including reduced
leaf thickness, lower stomatal density, decreased stomatal conductance (gs), and
diminished light intensity. These factors may contribute to reduced intercellular
CO2 concentration (Ci), Rubisco activity, and electron transport capacity (Lambers
et al. 1998). Notably, plants grown under I25 demonstrated higher
A values than those grown under full sunlight (I0) in
both species, suggesting that the irradiance at I0 may have
been excessive and induced dynamic photoinhibition. The parameter Fv/Fm is
used to assess the level of photoinhibition, with values below
0.75 indicating photoinhibition and a corresponding reduction in the maximum
quantum efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) (Bolhàr-Nordenkampf & Öquist 1993).
Under full sunlight, a decrease in Fv/Fm at midday followed
by recovery at the end of the day provides evidence
of dynamic, reversible photoinhibition (Bolhàr-Nordenkampf & Öquist 1993). This dynamic
photoinhibition, characterized by the temporary inactivation of PSII, serves as
an effective protective mechanism, as increased non-photochemical energy dissipation during
periods of reduced CO2 influx (due to stomatal closure) helps
prevent the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitigates
photooxidative damage (Choudhury & Behera 2001).
