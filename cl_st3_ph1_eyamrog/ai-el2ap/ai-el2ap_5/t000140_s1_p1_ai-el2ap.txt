Amid ongoing legal disputes regarding potential copyright infringement in the
distribution of assigned readings in university courses, this study examines
3,391 course syllabuses from 2015 to 2020, representing 34 universities
across nine Canadian provinces. The analysis identifies the types and
proportions of required readings, distinguishing between academic and non-academic sources.
Academic readings are assigned in 26.6% of syllabuses, while media
articles and trade book chapters appear in 8.3% of syllabuses.
Among all assigned readings, journal articles constitute 54.3%, scholarly book
chapters 33.5%, media articles 6.0%, and trade book chapters 6.3%.
The social sciences assign journal articles most frequently, the humanities
assign trade book chapters most frequently, and the sciences are
least likely to assign any type of reading. Textbooks are
required in 66.0% of syllabuses, with minimal variation across disciplines.
The data also allow for a page-level analysis of annual
student reading requirements, which, at the current Access Copyright tariff
of $14.31 per student (as approved by the Canadian Copyright
Board), equates to $0.021 per page. This rate is incorporated
into a proposed “three-step syllabus rule” designed to prevent double-charging
students for academic materials (which account for 90.1% of assigned
pages) while ensuring fair compensation for professional authors and publishers
(9.9%), resulting in an estimated annual charge of $1.40 per
student for assigned readings.
