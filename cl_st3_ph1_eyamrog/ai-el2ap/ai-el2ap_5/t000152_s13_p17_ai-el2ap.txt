In addition to concerns regarding employment and income, 8% of
participants in the Brazilian Association of Higher Education Administrators (2020b)
survey indicated their intention to discontinue their studies due to
the lack of distance learning options at their higher education
institutions (HEIs). This finding highlights the limited capacity of many
public HEIs to implement and support information and communication technologies
(ICT), digital platforms, and virtual learning environments necessary for maintaining
instruction during the crisis. Overall, both public and private Brazilian
HEIs often have inadequate ICT infrastructure. The Brazilian Association of
Distance Education has compiled a dossier addressing various aspects of
distance education in the context of COVID-19. For example, Furuno
(2020) discusses the challenges faced by HEIs without online teaching
platforms, while Tomazinho (2020) describes the difficulties related to broadband
service provision in Brazil. Despite the enactment of Resolution 343/2020
(Federative Republic of Brazil 2020), which permits the use of
ICT for remote delivery of university curricula, the crisis has
demonstrated that Brazilâ€™s public education system, similar to many others
globally, was insufficiently prepared for the transition to distance learning
modalities (Kerrers 2020; Adnam and Anwar 2020).
