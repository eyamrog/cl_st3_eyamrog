We operationalized the variable Donations, which represents the primary outcome
of interest in this study, as the total amount of
donations with donor restrictions reported in the Financial Statements. Additionally,
the single-item construct ‘NPO Certification’ was measured using the presence
of public certifications granted to NPOs in Brazil, specifically OS
(Social Organizations), OSCIP, or CEBAS (Charitable Organization for Social Assistance)
certification. We hypothesized that these certifications, some of which are
associated with governance mechanisms such as statutory requirements for independent
audits or the establishment of a superior deliberative body, would
positively moderate the relationship between Governance and Donations by increasing
organizational obligations. Furthermore, we posited that public certifications for NPOs
function similarly to quality standards (e.g., ISO), as organizations often
pursue certification to enhance their competitive advantage (Rao, 1994), and
many NPOs are adopting such practices to strengthen their position
in the donations market (Slatten, 2011).
