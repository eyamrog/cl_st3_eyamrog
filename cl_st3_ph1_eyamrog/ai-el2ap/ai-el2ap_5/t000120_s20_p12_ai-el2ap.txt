Physicochemical and Microbiological Analysis of Individual Soil Samples â€“ Comparison
of gravimetric humidity percentages indicated no significant difference between samples
in the control group (p = 0.11), while the treatment
group exhibited a significant difference between sampling periods (p =
0.01), which may be indirectly associated with the presence of
litter. As humidity decreased across all plots, species richness declined
in four out of five plots, suggesting that the observed
difference in species richness between the two periods (p =
0.06) is likely to be significant (Figure 1).
