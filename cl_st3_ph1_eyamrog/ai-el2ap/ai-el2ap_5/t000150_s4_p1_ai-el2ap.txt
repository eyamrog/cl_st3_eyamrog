These three examples provide insight into the dynamics of family
and kinship within migratory contexts and highlight the characteristics of
prevailing analytical frameworks. Specifically, regarding the dominant frameworks, the aim
is not to criticize or label them as obsolete, but
rather to elucidate how they function. These frameworks tend to
employ abstracted or generalized notions of family, often shaped by
broader theoretical objectives or diverse research agendas. Rather than seeking
to explain the family itself, they focus on other phenomena,
such as the nation-state or networks of migrant social relations.
Consequently, in pursuing their explanatory aims, these frameworks often overlook
or marginalize the specificities of family structures and relationships.
