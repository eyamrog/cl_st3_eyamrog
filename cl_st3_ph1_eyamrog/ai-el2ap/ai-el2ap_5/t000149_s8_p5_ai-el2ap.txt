Accurate data on land designated for livestock production are necessary
to optimize the use of natural vegetation resources. Accordingly, this
study aims to analyze the spontaneous plant species present on
land used for extensive cattle production in the Middle Valley
of RÃ­o Negro. Understanding the composition of the vegetation will
support the development of effective local-scale conservation strategies.
