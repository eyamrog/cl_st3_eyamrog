The fourth and final aspect concerns the potential benefits and
drawbacks associated with moving away from the traditional model of
schooling that existed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. While the
discourse surrounding the concept of a “learning society” suggests that
learning can become increasingly personalized—allowing students, through the use of
new technologies, to determine what, when, where, and how much
they learn based primarily on individual preferences and the need
to adapt to a rapidly changing world—a fully deterritorialized school
model lacks the capacity to ensure a key function historically
provided by schools: the consistent, daily interaction among the same
group of students and their teachers, who are responsible for
their education. This regular interaction has traditionally depended on a
shared physical space and structured time, which facilitate the development
of a collective daily routine, enable the attribution of meaning
to lived experiences, foster interpersonal understanding, and support the formation
of individual identity within a social context.
