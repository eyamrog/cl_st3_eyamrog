Figure 1-B presents data for the SciELO CI audience. Among
the countries analyzed, only Brazil provides sufficient data to compare
the percentage of citations in SciELO CI across the three
publication languages. When publications are in Portuguese, the SciELO CI
domain accounts for approximately two-thirds of the citations within the
Web of Science (WoS) platform databases. For publications in Spanish,
the impact within SciELO CI is slightly lower, at just
under 60.8%. In contrast, publications in English have a less
pronounced effect in the SciELO CI domain, with a citation
rate of 40.8%.
