The development of higher education in Brazil began with the
arrival of the Portuguese royal family in 1808 during the
Peninsular War, which contributed to the emergence of a bourgeois
class. Throughout the nineteenth century, eleven universities were established, beginning
with the School of Surgery and Anatomy in Bahia (DeHumerez
and Jankevicius 2015). During this period, higher education was primarily
designed to prepare individuals for professional practice and was largely
accessible only to the white bourgeois elite.
