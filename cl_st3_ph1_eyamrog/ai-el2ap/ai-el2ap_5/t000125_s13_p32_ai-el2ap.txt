Unesp no longer leads in all dimensions; it now holds
sole leadership only in “Regional Engagement” and shares first place
with the State University of Campinas in “Teaching and Learning.”
In addition to this shared position, the State University of
Campinas leads in both “Research” and “Knowledge Transfer.” The “International
Orientation” dimension is led by the Federal University of Ceará.
