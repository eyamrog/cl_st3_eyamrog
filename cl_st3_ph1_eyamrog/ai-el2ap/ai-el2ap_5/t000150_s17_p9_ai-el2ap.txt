This division resulted in the formation of two distinct social
groups whose lives remained largely separate. In a comprehensive notarial
survey, Kubota found that marriage rates between Okinawans and Japanese
in Campo Grande have consistently been minimal, and are lower
than the rates of marriage between Okinawans and Brazilians or
between Japanese and Brazilians. Ethnographic evidence indicates a systematic lack
of social interaction between Okinawans and Japanese (Naichi), manifested in
a reluctance to establish kinship ties. Marriages between Japanese and
Okinawans are extremely rare. Kinship in this context can be
understood as a political expression of the colonial relationship between
Japan and Okinawa, and this pattern persisted in Brazil for
most of the twentieth century.
