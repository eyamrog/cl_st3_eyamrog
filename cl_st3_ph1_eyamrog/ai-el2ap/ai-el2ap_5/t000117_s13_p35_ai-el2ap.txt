Sobe acknowledges that the traditional model of schooling, as experienced
prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, has fundamentally
changed. In the cited excerpts, he identifies the development of
a new form of education that will shape the future.

Education International Commission, he argues that the widely discussed "future
of education" has already materialized and now constitutes the past.
As Vidal and Bontempi Jr. (2020, p. 5) observe, "With
alarming speed, the futures we had envisaged have changed. In
other words, everything that we had anticipated would take place
in a week, a month or a year has dramatically
changed." This raises important questions regarding the implications of these
rapid transformations.
