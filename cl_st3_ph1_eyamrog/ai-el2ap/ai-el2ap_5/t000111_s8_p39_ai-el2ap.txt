Embedded interrogatives, as illustrated in (32)b, appear to differ slightly
from their matrix counterparts. Although they are also assumed to
be derived through wh-movement, evidence from Italian, as discussed by
Rizzi (1997) and Rizzi & Bocci (2017), suggests that the
displaced wh-element in embedded contexts does not exhibit focalization. This
is indicated by the absence of certain restrictions that are
observed in matrix clauses. In subordinate clauses, wh-operators are proposed
to occupy the Specifier position of an EmbQ projection.
