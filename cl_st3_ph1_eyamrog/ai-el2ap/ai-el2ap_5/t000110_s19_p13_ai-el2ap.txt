Eunotia superbidens Lange-Bertalot closely resembles Eunotia praerupta Ehrenberg (1843: 414)
in terms of size, but can be distinguished by the
presence of a single undulation on the dorsal margin and
a higher striae density. It also differs from Eunotia bigibba
KÃ¼tzing (1849: 6), primarily due to its more depressed undulations
and larger valve size. During the present study, E. superbidens
was infrequently observed, occurring in 2% of the core samples
and reaching a maximum relative abundance of 1%. The species
was identified in samples dated to the Late Holocene (~1,514
cal. yr BP). This investigation represents the first documented occurrence
of E. superbidens in the Brazilian Amazon.
