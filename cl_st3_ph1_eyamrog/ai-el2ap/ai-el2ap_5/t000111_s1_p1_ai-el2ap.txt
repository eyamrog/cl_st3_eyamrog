Data from Brazilian Portuguese support the claim advanced in this
paper that appositive free relatives exist, contrary to Emonds (1979),
who argues that free relatives cannot exhibit appositive semantics or
syntax. I present evidence that the wh-sentence discussed in the
title of this paper constitutes a free relative with appositive
content, based on considerations of distribution, matching, the properties of
quem, and semantic interpretation. The quem-type sentence analyzed here differs
from standard (headed) appositive relative clauses in that it appears
to be juxtaposed to, and equivalent with, the nominal it
modifies, a property that precludes the application of a relativization
process as described by Kayne (1994) for the derivation of
such sentences.
