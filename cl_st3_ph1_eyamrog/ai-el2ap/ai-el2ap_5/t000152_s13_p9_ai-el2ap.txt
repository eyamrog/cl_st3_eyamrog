Distance education has expanded access to higher education for a
significant portion of the Brazilian population living in precarious socioeconomic
conditions. In Brazil, the cost of distance education is substantially
lower than that of traditional on-site classes, enabling institutions to
extend their reach beyond urban centers to remote regions of
the country. Additionally, this modality is particularly suitable for socially
vulnerable groups, as it provides the flexibility to combine employment
with academic pursuits.
