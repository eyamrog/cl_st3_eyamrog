According to the author, these objectives are not novel but
were already present in educational reform literature of the previous
century. The school is expected to promote a universal form
of reasoning, aiming to develop cosmopolitan citizens characterized by a
"homeless mind," detached from local contexts. Individuals are encouraged to
adopt universal modes of thought to effectively plan their lives
within their communities. More recently, shifts in educational discourse have
been observed, particularly in response to an increasingly uncertain future.
The contemporary "unfinished cosmopolitan" is conceptualized as an individual who
engages in lifelong learning. Correspondingly, the role of the "lifelong
learner" is paralleled by that of the "reflexive teacher," who
is continuously engaged in critical reflection on their own practice
with the goal of achieving improved educational outcomes (Popkewitz, 2008).
