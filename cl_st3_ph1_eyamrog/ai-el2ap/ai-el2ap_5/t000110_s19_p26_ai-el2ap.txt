Caloneis sp. exhibits morphological similarities to Caloneis sp. NÂº. 163/14
as described by Metzeltin and Lange-Bertalot (1998: 560, pl. 163,
fig. 14); however, the specimens collected from the Xingu River
display slightly panduriform valves. Additional research is necessary to determine
whether this taxon represents a new species. In the present
study, this taxon was observed in 11% of the core
samples, with a maximum relative abundance of 2.5%, and was
found in samples corresponding to the end of the Mid-Holocene
(~5,192 cal. yr BP).
