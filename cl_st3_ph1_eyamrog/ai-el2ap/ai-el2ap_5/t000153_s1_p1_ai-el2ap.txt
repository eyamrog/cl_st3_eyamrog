This paper analyzes abortion-related stigma among healthcare professionals who provide
abortion services, with particular attention to the period when they
joined the Network of Healthcare Professionals for the Right to
Decide. Established in Argentina at the end of 2014 through
a collaboration between women’s and feminist organizations and healthcare professionals,
this network aims to support the right to abortion. The
study employs an exploratory, descriptive design using qualitative methods. Between
2016 and 2018, interviews were conducted with healthcare professionals to
examine the relationship between abortion stigma and membership in the
Network. The findings indicate that participation in a peer group
with shared professional goals and objectives has contributed to changes
in the professionals’ perceptions of abortion stigma. Respondents reported increased
confidence in resisting stigma-related factors, such as negative self-perception of
their work, fear of disclosure, and social isolation from colleagues.
The results demonstrate that active engagement in professional networks can
facilitate resistance to stigmatization by reinforcing professional identity.
