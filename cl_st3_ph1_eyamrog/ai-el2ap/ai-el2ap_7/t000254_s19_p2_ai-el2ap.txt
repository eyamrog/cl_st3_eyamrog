Conversely, the results indicated a decline in the number of
individuals (λ < 1) within the shrub-tree synusia (95% CI
= 0.993 ± 0.005) and climber groups (95% CI =
0.951 ± 0.003) with a diameter at breast height (dbh)
greater than 2.5 cm (Table 1). Similarly, all early-successional plant
species exhibited a reduction in individual numbers (λ < 1,
95% CI = 0.982 ± 0.015; Table 1).
