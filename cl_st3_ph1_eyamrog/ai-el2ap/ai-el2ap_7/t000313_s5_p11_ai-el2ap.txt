Viruses that utilize receptors with conserved amino acid sequences typically
exhibit a broad host range (Woolhouse et al., 2012). In
this context, it is notable that the ACE2 receptor maintains
a conserved amino acid sequence at key binding sites within
Homo sapiens, but this conservation is not observed across the
placental mammal species examined in this study. Consequently, while the
high mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 may enable it to infect
multiple species, a strong tropism for a particular host cell
is likely associated with minimal variation in the receptor binding
region within that target species.
