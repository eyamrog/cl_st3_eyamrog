In this case, the probability value of the t-statistic is
0.1646, which exceeds the conventional significance level of 0.05. This
result indicates that the interest rate does not have a
statistically significant effect on the level of investment inflow in
Turkey. Consequently, the null hypothesis is accepted, and the alternative
hypothesis is rejected, leading to the conclusion that the interest
rate does not significantly affect investment inflow in Turkey.
