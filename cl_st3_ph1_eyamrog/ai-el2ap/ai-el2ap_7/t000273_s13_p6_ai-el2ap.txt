Primary Health Care (PHC) addressed approximately 85% of the population’s
basic health needs and was associated with a 45% reduction
in hospitalizations for conditions sensitive to primary care between 2001
and 2016. Specifically, hospitalizations for asthma decreased by 76%, for
gastroenteritis by 66.5%, and for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases by
57.3%. In municipalities participating in the Mais Médicos (More Doctors)
program, the reduction in these hospital admissions was 4% greater
compared to municipalities without the program.
