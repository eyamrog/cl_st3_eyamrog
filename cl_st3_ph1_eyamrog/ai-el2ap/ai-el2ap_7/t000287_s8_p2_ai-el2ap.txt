As of April 30, 2020, Brazil reported 85,380 confirmed cases
and 5,901 deaths. However, underreporting and limited testing capacity, resulting
from social distancing measures and shortages of testing kits, likely
compromise the accuracy of these figures, suggesting that the published
data may not accurately reflect the true situation in Brazil.
During the same period, the state of Rio de Janeiro
recorded 9,453 diagnosed cases and 854 deaths.
