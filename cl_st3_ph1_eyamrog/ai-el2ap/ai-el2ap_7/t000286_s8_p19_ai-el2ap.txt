Additionally, some companies in the country have not offered favorable
interest rates to international entities, which has discouraged foreign investors
from investing in Turkey. Investors are generally unwilling to allocate
capital to an economy where, instead of maximizing profits, they
risk incurring losses relative to their cost of capital. Therefore,
the primary objective of this paper is to examine the
effect of selected macroeconomic variables on investment inflows in Turkey.
