The present study identified a high prevalence of depressive, anxiety,
and comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms in a sample of
the Brazilian population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the mean
severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the sample was
within the mild range, the prevalence of depressive symptoms was
approximately four times higher than those reported in previous studies
in Brazil that used similar screening instruments. Comparable studies have
also reported elevated prevalences of depressive and anxiety symptoms in
the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic in Paraguay (depression:
59.6%, anxiety: 47.2%), Turkey (moderate to severe depression: 18.6%, moderate
to severe anxiety: 26.5%), China (depression: 48.1%, anxiety: 22.6%, comorbid
symptoms: 19.4%), and the Basque region of Spain (depression: 20.8%,
anxiety: 29.0%). It is important to note that the present
study is not representative of the general population, and the
results should be interpreted with consideration of potential self-selection bias;
additionally, the screening tool employed does not provide a clinical
diagnosis of depressive or anxiety disorders. Nevertheless, the high prevalence
of symptoms observed suggests that the pandemic and associated self-isolation
measures may be adversely affecting mental health. Therefore, epidemiological studies
are needed to accurately estimate the true mental health burden
in the population. In the interim, despite the limitations regarding
representativeness and the potential for overestimation, the findings indicate that
policymakers should consider implementing measures to mitigate the mental health
burden during periods of mandated social isolation.
