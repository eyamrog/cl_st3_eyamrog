NWm ACE2 differs from that of other primate species due
to two alterations in potential glycosylation sites at positions 432
and 546, where asparagine (N) is replaced by serine (S)
(Luan et al., 2020). Glycosylation at these sites has been
inferred from the presence of electron density at all asparagine-linked
sites in the ACE2 N-terminal domain, including positions 432 and
546, and the loss of these glycosylation sites may have
functional consequences (Towler et al., 2004). Research on MERS-CoV and
its host-cell entry receptor, DPP4, has shown that mutations eliminating
glycosylation sites in mouse DPP4 prevent binding with the MERS-CoV
receptor-binding domain (RBD) (Peck et al., 2017). Peck et al.
(2017) concluded that glycosylation at orthologous DPP4 sites constitutes a
significant barrier to MERS-CoV infection, particularly when combined with taxon-specific
sequence variations.
