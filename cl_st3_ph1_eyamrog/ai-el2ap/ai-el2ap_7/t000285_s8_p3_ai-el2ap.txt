Epidemiologists have reported a possible temporal overlap between outbreaks of
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Dengue in
Brazil during the first half of 2020 (4). Recent advances
in the understanding of COVID-19 indicate a high degree of
similarity in the pathophysiological mechanisms, as well as in the
clinical signs and symptoms, between SARS-CoV-2 infection and arboviral infections
in general, including manifestations such as fever and pronounced systemic
inflammatory responses (2).
