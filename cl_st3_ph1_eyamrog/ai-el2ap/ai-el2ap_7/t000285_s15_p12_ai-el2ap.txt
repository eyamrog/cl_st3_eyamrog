One author (KMM) will initially screen the titles and abstracts
of studies for potential inclusion in this review. In cases
where duplicate studies are identified, only one instance will be
retained. If multiple reports are found that involve the same
participants but differ in outcome measures or assessment time points,
these will be considered collectively as a single study. Following
the removal of duplicates, KMM will review the titles and
abstracts to exclude studies that clearly do not meet the
eligibility criteria. The remaining studies will undergo full-text assessment by
two authors (APR and ACPNP) to determine final inclusion. Any
disagreements regarding study selection will be resolved by a third
author (KMM). The reasons for study exclusion will be documented.
The Rayyan software (6) will be utilized to facilitate the
screening and selection process.
