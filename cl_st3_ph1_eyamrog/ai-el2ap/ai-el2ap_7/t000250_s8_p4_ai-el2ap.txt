Physical distancing and self-isolation measures have led to reduced opportunities
for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) due to the closure of
stadiums, parks, and gyms. Additionally, individuals in self-isolation at home
are more likely to engage in sedentary activities, such as
watching television and using computers while seated. Considering the potential
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on lifestyle behaviors and mental
health, as well as the established association between depressive and
anxiety symptoms, it is important to investigate the relationship between
MVPA, sedentary behavior (SB), and depressive and anxiety symptoms within
the context of COVID-19.
