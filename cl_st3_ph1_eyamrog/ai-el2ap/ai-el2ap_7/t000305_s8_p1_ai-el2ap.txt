In December 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown
etiology emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, where a novel
coronavirus, subsequently designated as 2019-nCoV, was identified. Due to the
novelty of this viral strain and the inability to isolate
the initial cases, effective containment and response efforts were significantly
hindered. Early epidemiological data indicated that older adults, particularly those
with systemic arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus, constituted the primary
risk groups.
