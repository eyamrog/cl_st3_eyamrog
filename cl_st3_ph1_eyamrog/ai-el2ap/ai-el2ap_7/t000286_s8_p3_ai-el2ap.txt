This suggests the advantageous deferral of consumption to a future
period. Such an increase in expected future consumption is realized
only if the allocated resources generate returns that meet or
exceed the opportunity cost of capital. Additionally, this process may
involve the production of capital goods, which are not intended
for immediate consumption but are instead utilized in subsequent production
activities.
