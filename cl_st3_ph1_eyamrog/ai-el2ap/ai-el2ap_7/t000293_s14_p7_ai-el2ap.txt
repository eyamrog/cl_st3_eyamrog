Frequencies and percentages were used to summarize categorical variables, while
mean, median, interquartile range (IQR), and range were used to
describe continuous variables. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value
(PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for two
scenarios: in the first, only chest CT scans with typical
findings were classified as positive; in the second, chest CT
scans with either typical or indeterminate findings were classified as
positive. The RT-PCR test served as the reference standard. Proportions
were reported with binomial exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using
Clopper-Pearson CIs for sensitivity and specificity, and standard logit CIs
for PPV and NPV. Sensitivity and specificity between the two
scenarios were compared using the McNemar test. A p-value of
less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses
were conducted using SPSS software, version 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk,
NY, USA).
