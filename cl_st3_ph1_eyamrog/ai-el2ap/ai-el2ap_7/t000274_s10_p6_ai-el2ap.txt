During the current pandemic, all patients admitted to emergency departments
should be regarded as potential carriers of COVID-19 until infection
is ruled out. Additionally, patients presenting with respiratory symptoms should
be managed as suspected cases of COVID-19 until a definitive
diagnosis is established, given the absence of a rapid diagnostic
test for this condition at present.
