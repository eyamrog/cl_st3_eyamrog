The countries in group 5.1 (the USA, Spain, and the
UK) were selected for comparison with their counterparts (Mexico, Portugal,
and Ireland) and exhibited higher incidence and mortality rates than
the other groups analyzed, with 154.835 cases per 100,000 inhabitants
and 9.925 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. Comparative analysis between groups
5.1 and 5.2 demonstrated that group 5.1 had significantly higher
incidence, mortality, and lethality rates. Specifically, group 5.1 showed an
incidence rate 8.01 times higher, a mortality rate 14.73 times
higher, and a lethality rate 1.84 times higher than group
6.2 (p < 0.001) (Table 2).
