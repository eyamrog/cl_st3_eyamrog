In this survey of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among Brazilian blood donors,
we observed a seroprevalence of 3.3% (95% CI: 2.6–4.1), adjusted
for the sensitivity and specificity of the assay and weighted
according to the age and sex distribution of the Rio
de Janeiro State population aged 18–69 years. This estimate exceeds
those reported in two comparable seroprevalence studies among blood donors
in Denmark and the Netherlands, which found rates of 1.7%
and 2.7%, respectively [16, 17]. Subgroup analysis revealed significant variation
in prevalence, with higher rates among younger individuals and those
without a college education. Additionally, there was a statistically significant
linear increase in seroprevalence over the three weeks of the
study (2.8%, 4.5%, and 5.3%, respectively; p<0.01), primarily attributable to
an increase in IgG and IgM antibody positivity.
