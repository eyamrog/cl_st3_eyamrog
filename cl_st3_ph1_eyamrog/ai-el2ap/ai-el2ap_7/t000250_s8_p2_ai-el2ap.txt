Prediction models indicate that the early implementation of physical distancing
could prevent approximately 90,000 deaths in the largest metropolitan area
in Brazil. Although self-isolation measures are essential for reducing infection
rates, these interventions, in combination with heightened concerns related to
the pandemic, may be associated with adverse effects on mental
health, including increased symptoms of depression and anxiety. Consequently, it
is necessary to develop and implement strategies to mitigate both
the current and future mental health impacts associated with these
public health measures.
