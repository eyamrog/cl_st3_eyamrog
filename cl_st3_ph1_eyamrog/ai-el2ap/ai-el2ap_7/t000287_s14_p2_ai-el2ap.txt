The test results led to three primary outcomes: (1) Healthcare
workers (HCWs) with asymptomatic or symptomatic positive IgM results and/or
positive RT-PCR were immediately quarantined for 14 days; (2) HCWs
with negative serology and no symptoms were instructed to continue
using protective measures and personal protective equipment (PPE); (3) HCWs
with indeterminate IgM results were re-tested after one week under
the supervision of an infectious diseases physician.
