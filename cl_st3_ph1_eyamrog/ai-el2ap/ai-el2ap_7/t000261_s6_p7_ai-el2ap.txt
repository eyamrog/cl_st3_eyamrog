The Trophic State Index (TSI) effectively reflected the susceptibility of
this shallow tropical reservoir to inappropriate management practices (Bicudo et
al. 2007) and demonstrated the persistent adverse impact of self-eutrophication
on ecosystem recovery (Jeppesen et al. 2003, 2005). Additionally, the
TSI was responsive to significant historical events associated with the
regulation of sewage effluent discharges.
