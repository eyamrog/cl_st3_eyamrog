In the last two weeks of April 2020, a seroprevalence
survey was conducted among voluntary blood donors at Hemorio, the
principal blood center in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. This
study reports the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in a
sample of 2,857 voluntary blood donors, with adjustments made for
sex and age group to provide data that can inform
health authorities in their estimates, extrapolations, and public health interventions.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study in Latin America to assess SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in asymptomatic
blood donors.
