Determining the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic individuals is important
for two primary reasons. First, individuals without symptoms in epidemic
regions may still be infected and contribute substantially to viral
transmission. For example, during the early phase of the epidemic
in China, approximately 86% of infections were undetected, yet these
cases accounted for an estimated 79% of subsequent transmissions [8].
Second, assessing herd immunity provides critical information regarding the extent
of infection spread within a community. Monitoring herd immunity levels
can inform public health decisions about the appropriate timing for
relaxing social distancing measures, thereby reducing the risk of future
epidemic outbreaks [12].
