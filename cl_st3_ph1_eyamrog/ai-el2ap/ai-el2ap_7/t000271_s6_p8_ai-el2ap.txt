Despite these limitations, the available evidence indicates that protective levels
of natural herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 have not been achieved
under the current social distancing policies in Rio de Janeiro,
and therefore should not be considered a viable target for
informing short-term exit strategies. Consequently, decisions regarding the relaxation of
social distancing measures in the near term should primarily be
based on the capacity of the healthcare system to manage
cases, rather than assumptions about population immunity, until comprehensive, population-based
serological surveys are conducted. Such surveys should be designed to
assess regional variations in herd immunity within the state and
may inform the development of more localized strategies, taking into
account the levels of natural immunity, population vulnerability, and the
availability of resources for testing and treatment of severe COVID-19
cases.
