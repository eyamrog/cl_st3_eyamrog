The search strategy involved a systematic review of the MEDLINE/PubMed,
Scientific Electronic Library (SciELO), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences
(LILACS), Web of Science, and Scopus databases, focusing on scientific
studies published within the past 20 years. The Medical Subject
Headings (MeSH) terms utilized were "pacifier," "disinfection," "biofilm," and "microbiology."
The search was conducted by combining the term "pacifier" with
each of the other descriptors using the Boolean operator "AND,"
resulting in the following search equations: (pacifier AND disinfection), (pacifier
AND biofilm), and (pacifier AND microbiology).
