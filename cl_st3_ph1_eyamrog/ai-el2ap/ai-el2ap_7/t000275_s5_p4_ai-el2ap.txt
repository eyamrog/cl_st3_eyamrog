Healthcare professionals who are in contact with COVID-19 patients are
at an increased risk of infection. Procedures that generate aerosols,
such as non-invasive ventilation (NIV), high-flow nasal cannula, mask ventilation,
and intubation, are associated with a higher risk of viral
transmission. Lima et al. have recently published a technical note
for surgeons and emergency physicians outlining methods to perform cricothyroidostomies
and tracheostomies with recommendations for safer procedural alternatives. Additionally, minimally
invasive surgeries utilize carbon dioxide insufflation to elevate intra-abdominal pressure,
which may facilitate aerosol dispersion. Richard et al. have demonstrated
that rapid deflation of pneumoperitoneum under standard conditions can result
in environmental contamination with blood and other body fluids.
