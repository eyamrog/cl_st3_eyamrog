The mortality of large specimens due to past disturbances, as
reported in other areas of the park (Struffaldi-De-Vuono 1985, Gomes
& Mantovani 2001, Peccinini & Pivello 2002, Gomes et al.
2003), may have increased light availability in the lower forest
strata and promoted a higher turnover rate among smaller plants,
thereby influencing the establishment of climbers, particularly woody climbers (lianas).
The persistence of lianas is dependent on the presence of
large trees within the forest (Engel et al. 1998, Phillips
et al. 2005, Sfair et al. 2013).
