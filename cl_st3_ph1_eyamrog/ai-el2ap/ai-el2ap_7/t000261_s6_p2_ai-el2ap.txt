The water quality of the system has gradually declined since
the construction of the city zoo in 1958 in a
headspring area upstream of Garças Reservoir, and further deteriorated following
the establishment of the Department of Agriculture in 1975. Both
facilities lacked adequate sanitation infrastructure and contributed substantial sewage loads
to the system (Table 3). According to Bicudo et al.
(2007), these conditions led to eutrophication, which resulted in seasonal
cyanobacterial blooms, rapid proliferation of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), and
increased mosquito populations. In response to the mosquito problem, most
of the macrophytes were mechanically removed within a few months
during the period of cyanobacterial bloom (Table 3). This management
intervention was followed by a shift in Garças Reservoir, characterized
by internal phosphorus loading and persistent cyanobacterial blooms, indicating a
transition to a degraded and potentially irreversible state. The Trophic
State Index (TSI) documented this abrupt change, particularly during the
1999-2000 transition (Figure 2), demonstrating a clear shift to a
hypereutrophic condition. Bicudo et al. (2007) provided a detailed analysis
of this process, categorizing it into distinct limnological phases (I,
II, and III; see reference) and discussing the consequences of
the management actions taken.
