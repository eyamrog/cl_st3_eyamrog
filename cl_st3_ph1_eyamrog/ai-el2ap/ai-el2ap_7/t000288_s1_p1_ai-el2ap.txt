The global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has raised
significant concerns among health professionals, particularly within the field of
dentistry, due to the virusâ€™s high virulence and its transmission
via saliva aerosols. Evidence indicates that the virus remains viable
in the air for at least three hours and can
persist on plastic and stainless-steel surfaces for up to 72
hours. Consequently, dental offices in both public and private sectors
represent high-risk environments for cross-infection among patients, dentists, and other
healthcare personnel, including those in hospital-based dental care facilities. This
manuscript aims to synthesize the current evidence regarding prevention strategies
for dental professionals and to provide a brief overview of
promising treatment approaches identified to date. The objective is to
inform dental practitioners about the virology and microbiology of COVID-19
and to offer guidance on managing emergency consultations in accordance
with international recommendations. It is important for dentists to recognize
that a considerable proportion of individuals, including children, may be
asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 and capable of transmitting the virus.
At present, there is no definitive treatment for COVID-19, and
rapid diagnosis remains challenging. Therefore, all elective and non-essential dental
procedures should be postponed, with only urgent and emergency cases
being managed in person. The implementation of teledentistry, such as
consultations via phone calls or text messages, is a promising
approach to maintaining patient communication while minimizing the risk of
infection.
