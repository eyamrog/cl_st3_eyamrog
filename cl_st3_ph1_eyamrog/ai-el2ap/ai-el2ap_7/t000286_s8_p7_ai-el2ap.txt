Investment inflows into various sectors of the economy stimulate aggregate
employment, output, and demand, which in turn increase government revenue
available for the provision of essential industrial and agricultural inputs
that support economic growth and development. This process indicates that
the investment inflow multiplier effect raises national income, subsequently leading
to higher levels of savings, investment, consumption, and aggregate demand.
As a result, these dynamics contribute to an improved standard
of living for the population.
