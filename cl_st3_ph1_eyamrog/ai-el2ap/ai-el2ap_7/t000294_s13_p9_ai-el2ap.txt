The use of surgical masks by patients has been shown
to reduce aerosol transmission, particularly when individuals present with mild
respiratory symptoms or are in contact with persons suspected of
having COVID-19. This practice is recommended from the time of
arrival at healthcare facilities, throughout their stay in isolation areas,
and during movement within the facility, such as transport between
different areas or sectors. Patients are also advised to minimize
contact with the mask, as well as with their eyes,
mouth, and face, to further decrease the risk of transmission.22-23
