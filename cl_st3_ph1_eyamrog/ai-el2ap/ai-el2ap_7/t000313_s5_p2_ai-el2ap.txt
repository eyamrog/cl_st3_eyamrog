SARS-CoV-like viruses utilize ACE2 as a receptor to enter host
cells. Figure 2 presents the diversity of 70 ACE2 orthologues,
focusing on 30 potential binding sites for the S glycoproteins
of SARS-CoV-like viruses. The high mutation and recombination rates characteristic
of these coronaviruses contribute to their rapid evolution (Li et
al., 2020a). Such genetic variability in RNA viruses is associated
with an increased frequency of host switching and the ability
to infect distantly related species more often than other pathogens
(Woolhouse et al., 2005a, 2005b; Davies and Pedersen, 2008; Longdon
et al., 2014). This evidence supports the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2
may have originated from one or more phylogenetically distant hosts,
such as bats and pangolins (Guo et al., 2020; Ji
et al., 2020; Lam et al., 2020; Li et al.,
2020c; Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020).
