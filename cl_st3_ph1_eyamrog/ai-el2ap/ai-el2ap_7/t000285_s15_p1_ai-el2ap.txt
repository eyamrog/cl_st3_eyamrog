This study outlines the rationale, hypothesis, and planned methodology for
a systematic review, which has been submitted for registration on
the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews platform. In
response to the urgent need for timely evidence during the
COVID-19 pandemic, a rapid living systematic review approach will be
employed, with title and abstract screening conducted by a single
author to expedite the process. Furthermore, the review will utilize
a living methodology, continuously updating and incorporating new clinical trial
registrations and relevant data as they become available. The systematic
review process will adhere to the guidelines outlined in the
Cochrane Collaboration Handbook.
