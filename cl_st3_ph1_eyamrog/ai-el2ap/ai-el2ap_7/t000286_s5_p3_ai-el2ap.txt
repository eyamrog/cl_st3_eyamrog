The results show that the coefficients for government deficit, inflation,
interest rate, and exchange rate are statistically insignificant, with p-values
of 0.5767, 0.9094, 0.1646, and 0.7513, respectively. Specifically, these variables
do not exhibit statistical significance at the 10 percent level,
indicating that there is insufficient evidence to suggest a meaningful
relationship between these factors and the dependent variable within the
context of this analysis.
