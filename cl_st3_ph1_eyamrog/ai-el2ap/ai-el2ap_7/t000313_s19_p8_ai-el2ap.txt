A Serine (S) residue was also identified at the positively
selected site 559, which has been shown to reduce or
inhibit the interaction between the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein and ACE2
(Li et al., 2005b). This amino acid substitution at position
559 is present not only in rodents but also in
certain carnivore species previously considered as potential original or intermediate
hosts, including the pangolin (Manis javanica). The ACE2 protein of
the pangolin shares approximately 85% sequence similarity with human ACE2
(Lam et al., 2020); however, when considering only the 30
sites analyzed in this study, the similarity decreases to 66%.
Furthermore, a Serine at position 559 is also observed in
two species of the Mustelidae family, namely the ferret (Mustela
putorius) and the sea otter (Enhydra lutris).
