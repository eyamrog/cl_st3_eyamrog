Our findings indicate that a significant portion of the taxon-specific
diversity observed in ACE2 can be attributed to positive natural
selection, likely due to its role as a membrane protein
involved in water intake, blood pressure regulation, and other cardiovascular
functions. Additionally, adaptation to novel hosts often results in reduced
performance on the original host (Longdon et al., 2014). SARS-CoV-2
demonstrates a high capacity to infect Homo sapiens across diverse
populations; however, it appears to be less efficient at infecting
other species or re-infecting its original or intermediate hosts, such
as bats or pangolins, particularly when these hosts are phylogenetically
distant. The emergence of new mutations or recombination events may
enable SARS-CoV-2 to overcome species barriers in the future, thereby
perpetuating the ongoing evolutionary dynamics between host and pathogen.
