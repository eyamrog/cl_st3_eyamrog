Although existing data indicate that patients with cancer who receive
chemotherapy are at increased risk for severe complications from influenza,
it remains uncertain whether these findings are applicable to COVID-19.
A recent study reported a higher incidence and morbidity of
COVID-19 among patients with cancer; however, these results have been
directly contested by subsequent research. Preliminary data from Zhang et
al. demonstrated a relatively high mortality rate, with 8 out
of 28 (29%) hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who had a
prior cancer diagnosis succumbing to the disease.
