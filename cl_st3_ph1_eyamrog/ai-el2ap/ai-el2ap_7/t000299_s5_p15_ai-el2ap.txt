Microwave irradiation represents another protocol for pacifier disinfection. This method
is considered optional and straightforward, and it can be employed
to eliminate or reduce the presence of pathogenic microorganisms on
the surface of pacifiers [15]. Previous studies have demonstrated its
effectiveness not only for pacifiers but also for disinfecting other
dental materials, such as orthodontic instruments [32]. Specifically, using a
microwave at power level 7 (equivalent to 70% of total
power) for 7 minutes has been shown to be effective
in disinfecting pacifiers contaminated with S. mutans and C. albicans
[3,8]. Additionally, disinfection has been achieved using a microwave at
full power for 5 minutes [15]. Nevertheless, the efficacy of
this method should be interpreted with caution due to variations
in power settings and differences among microwave models.
