The data indicate that regions near the intervals 21578, 29876,
29390, 3952, and 11076 exhibit elevated values. According to database
consultation, this observation is consistent with the presence of Gene
S, Gene N, and ORF10 in these regions, which is
considered a positive finding. Further investigation is warranted specifically around
the 11078 interval (spanning 20 nucleotides) to elucidate its significance.
It should be noted that Gene Orf1ab occupies the range
[269, 21,558], accounting for approximately 71% of the entire genome,
which is a substantial portion. The observed maximum value at
approximately 11,000 suggests a notable feature within this region.
