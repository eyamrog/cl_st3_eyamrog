Prior to proceeding to the operating room, several factors should
be evaluated, including the local risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, anticipated
length of hospital stay, potential surgical complications, and the presence
of clinical comorbidities that may increase morbidity or mortality. If
surgical intervention is determined to be necessary, informed consent must
be obtained, explicitly addressing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Preoperative
testing for COVID-19 is recommended for all surgical patients; however,
in our institution, testing is currently limited to symptomatic individuals.
