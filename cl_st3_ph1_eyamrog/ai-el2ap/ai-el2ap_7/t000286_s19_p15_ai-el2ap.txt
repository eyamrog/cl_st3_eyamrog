The results indicate that INT does not Granger-cause FDI, as
the null hypothesis is accepted at the 5% significance level,
with a probability value of 0.1538. Similarly, FDI does not
Granger-cause INT, as the null hypothesis is also accepted at
the 5% significance level, with a probability value of 0.8541,
which is further supported by the F-statistic value of 0.15915.
These findings suggest that there is no evidence of causality
in either direction between INT and FDI.
