Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI),
a 21-item self-report instrument. Each item presents four statements reflecting
increasing severity of depressive symptoms, with responses scored from 0
(least severe) to 3 (most severe). The total BDI score
ranges from 0 to 63. Scores of 0–9 indicate minimal
or no depressive symptoms, 10–18 indicate mild to moderate depressive
symptoms, 19–29 indicate moderate to severe depressive symptoms, and 30–63
indicate severe depressive symptoms. In this study, depression was dichotomized
as either no depressive symptoms (scores 0–9) or prevalent depressive
symptoms (scores 10–63).
