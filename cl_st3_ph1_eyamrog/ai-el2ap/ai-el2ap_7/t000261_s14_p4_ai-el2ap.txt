To identify significant changepoints in the time series, we analyzed
the data for substantial changes in mean and variance. This
approach partitions the data into segments characterized by distinct mean
and variance values, with a changepoint defined as the observation
that delineates these segments (Killick & Eckley, 2014). The procedure
facilitated the detection of critical shifts in the trophic dynamics
of the Gar√ßas Reservoir and was implemented using the changepoint
package (Killick & Eckley, 2014) and the PELT algorithm (Hinkley,
1970), which allows for the identification of multiple changepoints. All
analyses were conducted using the R software (R Core Team,
2019).
