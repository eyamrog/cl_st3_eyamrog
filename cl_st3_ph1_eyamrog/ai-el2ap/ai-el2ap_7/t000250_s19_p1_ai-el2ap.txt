A total of 937 adults were included in the study.
The sample was predominantly female (72.3%), with 52.6% of participants

in sedentary behavior (SB) was 10.0 hours per day (IQR
= 5.0). A total of 500 participants (53.4%) engaged in
at least 30 minutes of MVPA per day, and 311

any psychiatric disorder was 41.0%, including depression (20.0%), any anxiety
disorder (24.4%), bipolar disorder (2.0%), and schizophrenia or other psychotic
