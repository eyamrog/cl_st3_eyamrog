Tracheal intubation (TI) should be considered the primary method for
airway management, with surgical airway techniques reserved for situations where
TI is unsuccessful or contraindicated. Adherence to established guidelines for
the management of difficult airways is recommended to minimize unnecessary
or premature use of surgical airway interventions.
