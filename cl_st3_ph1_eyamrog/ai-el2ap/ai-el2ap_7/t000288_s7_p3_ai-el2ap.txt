Following the World Health Organization (WHO) declaration of the COVID-19
pandemic, organizations such as the General Coordination of Oral Health
of the Brazilian Health Ministry issued Technical Notes providing key
guidelines for dental practice in the context of the pandemic.
Similarly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and
the American Dental Association (ADA) have recommended that dentists postpone
elective procedures and focus on providing only emergency or urgent
dental care to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission, a
strategy that has also been implemented in several cities in
China.
