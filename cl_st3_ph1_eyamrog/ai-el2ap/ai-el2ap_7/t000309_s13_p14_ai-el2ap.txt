The association between malnutrition and increased risk of infections is
well documented in the literature on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
(23,24). Hypoalbuminemia, which is recognized as a marker of systemic
inflammation, is observed in approximately 20% of IBD patients (25,26).
In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, social isolation may
adversely affect patients' access to nutritious foods and contribute to
suboptimal dietary habits, potentially leading to nutritional deficiencies. Consequently, a
balanced diet consisting of four to six small meals per
day and adequate hydration was recommended. Additionally, all patients were
advised to cease smoking.
