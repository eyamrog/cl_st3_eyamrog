In this study, we evaluated the dynamics of plant communities
across different strata and life forms over a 6.5-year period
in an urban forest remnant within the PEFI, a protected
area located in one of the largest urban regions globally
(CONDEPHAAT 2018). Smaller individuals, particularly those in the understory, are
indicative of forest regeneration and are often more sensitive to
environmental disturbances (Gomes et al. 2003; Salles & Schiavini 2007)
as well as more dynamic in terms of population turnover
(Condit et al. 1996b; Machado & Oliveira-Filho 2010; Feeley et
al. 2011). Additionally, certain life forms such as climbers have
been shown to exhibit greater demographic dynamics compared to shrubs
and trees, as demonstrated in previous ecological studies (Wright et
al. 2004; Phillips et al. 2005; Schnitzer 2005; Nepstad et
al. 2007; Laurance et al. 2014; Nogueira et al. 2014),
which aligns with our hypothesis for the studied plant community.
Based on this evidence, we expect that smaller individuals will
display higher mortality and recruitment rates, and that climbing plants
will exhibit the highest demographic dynamics (mortality and recruitment) relative
to the shrub-tree synusia.
