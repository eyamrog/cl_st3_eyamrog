Over a period of 6.5 years, the increase in the
basal area of the shrub-tree synusia (individuals with diameter at
breast height > 2.5 cm) was significantly greater than the
reduction, resulting in a net increase in total basal area
from 24.32 to 27.10 m² ha⁻¹ (Table 3). This change
was reflected in a significant difference between the percentage gain
(median = 14.71%) and loss (median = 4.95%) of basal
area (Mann-Whitney test, U = 11, p = 0.002, λ
> 1, 95% CI = 1.015 ± 0.007). In contrast,
the basal area of climbers decreased slightly from 1.564 m²
ha⁻¹ to 1.559 m² ha⁻¹ (Table 3), with no significant
difference between the percentage gain (median = 27.48%) and loss
(median = 49.87%) during the same period (Mann-Whitney test, U
= 45, p = 0.734). However, the reduction in basal
area for climbers was significantly greater than that observed for
the shrub-tree community (Mann-Whitney test, U = 12, p =
0.003, λ < 1, 95% CI = 0.970 ± 0.009).
