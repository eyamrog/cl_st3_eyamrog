Dentists should prioritize preventive care and testing, as their actions
can significantly influence efforts to reduce the transmission rate of
infectious diseases and prevent overburdening the healthcare system. Multiple modeling
studies and scenario analyses, including those conducted during the current
pandemic and previous outbreaks in countries such as China and
Italy, indicate that a combination of interventions is necessary for
both the general population and healthcare professionals. Recommended measures for
all healthcare workers, including dentists, include daily temperature monitoring and
health screening of staff, use of N95 masks, remote work
when feasible through telecommunication technologies, adherence to social distancing, implementation
of mobility restrictions, avoidance of crowded places, diagnostic testing, and
isolation of infected individuals and their close contacts. In particular,
dentists should adhere to updated protocols and adopt new tools
and technologies in dental practice to protect both oral health
professionals and the patients they serve.
