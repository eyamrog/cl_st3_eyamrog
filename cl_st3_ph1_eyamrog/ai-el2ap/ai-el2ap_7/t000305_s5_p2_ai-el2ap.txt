Analysis of Fig. 4 indicates that the assertion regarding the
protective effect of BCG vaccination on the incidence and lethality
of COVID-19 in several countries has been subject to significant
criticism, primarily because most countries in group 2 are at
an earlier stage in the progression of the pandemic. To
address potential selection bias, this study implemented a time equalization
procedure for all countries, aligning data from the respective onset
dates of the pandemic in each country. This adjustment is
expected to be unnecessary in future analyses, as the continued
progression of the pandemic will provide further clarification on this
issue (see Fig. 5).
