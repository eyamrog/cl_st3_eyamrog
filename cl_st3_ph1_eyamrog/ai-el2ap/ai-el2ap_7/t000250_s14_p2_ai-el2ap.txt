Participants were recruited via social media platforms and through invitations
disseminated within established researcher networks. Eligible participants were Brazilian adults
(aged 18 years or older) residing in Brazil who were
in self-isolation as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. For
the purposes of this study, self-isolation was defined as voluntarily
remaining at home and leaving only for essential activities, such
as purchasing food, visiting pharmacies, or seeking healthcare services. Participants
accessed a secure online survey platform (www.qualtrics.com), where they provided
informed consent after reviewing an information sheet.
