The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic, with the virus utilizing the human membrane protein
ACE2 as a receptor for host cell entry. In this
study, we conducted a comparative genomic analysis of 70 ACE2
orthologues from placental mammals to identify sequence variations and to
elucidate the evolutionary dynamics underlying the adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to
human infection. Our analysis indicates that 4% of ACE2 sites
are under positive selection, all of which are located within
the catalytic domain, suggesting the presence of taxon-specific adaptations potentially
related to ACE2â€™s physiological roles, such as in cardiovascular function.
Among all variable sites, we selected 30 that are situated
at critical ACE2 binding interfaces with SARS-CoV-like viruses for detailed
examination. The results demonstrate a relatively high degree of ACE2
diversity among placental mammal species, while no polymorphism was observed
within human populations at these 30 inter-species variable sites. These
findings indicate that the genetic landscape of ACE2 in humans
may have facilitated the adaptation of SARS-CoV-2. We propose that
SARS-CoV-2 has evolved as a specialist coronavirus for human hosts.
Variations in infection and mortality rates may be attributable to
differences in innate immune responses, other unidentified genetic factors, as
well as non-biological influences.
