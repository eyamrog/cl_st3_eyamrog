Our results indicate that the M2 model (NsSite; ω >
1) provides a significantly better fit to the placental mammal
ACE2 data than the neutral model (ω2 = 2.58680, p
< 0.001; Table S2). Under the M2 model, 4% of
ACE2 sites are inferred to be under positive selection, suggesting
non-neutral molecular evolution of this gene in placental mammals. However,
this pattern is not uniform across the different domains of
the ACE2 protein. A Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) analysis identified
22 sites (24, 34, 91, 93, 212, 228, 231, 251,
255, 286, 301, 387, 559, 568, 607, 653, 657, 658,
671, 675, 689, and 732) (Table S3; Figure 1) with
a high probability (> 95%) of being under positive selection,
all of which are located within the extracellular region of
the protein (residues 18–740) that contains the ACE2 catalytic domain.
Of the remaining ACE2 sites, 69% are subject to purifying
selection (ω0 = 0.10125), while 27% exhibit relaxed selection (ω1
= 1). The signal peptide (residues 1–17), transmembrane domain (741–761),
and cytoplasmic domain (761–805; see ω3 column of Table S4)
are more conserved, displaying little variation across species and no
evidence of positive selection (Tables S2 and S4). ACE2 is
a key component in the regulation of blood pressure and
cardiovascular function, among other roles, and the amino acid changes
under positive selection may be taxon-specific, potentially associated with adaptive
phenotypes in certain placental mammal lineages.
