We will conduct systematic searches in Medline via PubMed, Embase
via Elsevier, the Cochrane Library (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials [CENTRAL]), Portal Regional BVS (LILACS), Scopus, and Web of
Science, utilizing relevant descriptors and synonyms and adapting the search
strategies to the specific requirements of each database to identify
published, ongoing, and unpublished studies. Additionally, we will search COVID-19-specific
databases, including the Epistemonikos COVID-19 LÂ·OVE platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the
World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP).
Reference lists of included studies will also be screened using
the snowballing technique. No language restrictions will be applied during
study selection.
