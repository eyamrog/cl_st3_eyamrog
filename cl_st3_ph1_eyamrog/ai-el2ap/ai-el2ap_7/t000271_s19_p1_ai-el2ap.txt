Of the 120 true negative samples, one tested positive for
IgM; this sample was obtained from a donor confirmed to
be anti-HCV positive. Based on these findings, the estimated specificity
was 99.16%, which is consistent with the manufacturer's reported specificity
(95% CI: 95.0%â€“99.8%). All samples tested negative for IgG.
