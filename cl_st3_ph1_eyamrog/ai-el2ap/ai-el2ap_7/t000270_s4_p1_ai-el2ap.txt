Except for fascicle 18, which covered the Volvocales (Chlorophyceae) and
was published in the “Revista Brasileira de Botânica” (currently the
“Brazilian Journal of Botany”), all other fascicles were published in
“Hoehnea,” the journal established specifically for the publication of the
“Flora Ficológica do PEFI” (PEFI Algal Flora). To date, forty-two
fascicles have been published, and completion of the flora is
anticipated by the end of 2020. Table 1 presents the
groups that have already been studied and the number of
taxa identified for each group.
