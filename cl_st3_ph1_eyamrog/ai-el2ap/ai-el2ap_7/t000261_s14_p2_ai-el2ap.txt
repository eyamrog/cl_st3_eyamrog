Data sampling was conducted monthly over a 20-year period (1997â€“2017),
consistently in the morning at the deepest site of the
reservoir. Water samples were collected using a Van Dorn sampler
and transferred to acid-rinsed bottles. Water transparency was measured with
a Secchi disk, total phosphorus (TP) concentration was determined following
the method of Valderrama (1981), and chlorophyll-a concentration, corrected for
pheophytin, was measured using 90% ethanol as described by Sartory
and Grobbelaar (1984).
