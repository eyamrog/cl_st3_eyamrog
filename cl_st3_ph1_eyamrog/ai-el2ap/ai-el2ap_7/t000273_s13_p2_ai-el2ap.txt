To prevent or delay the collapse of the health system,
as observed in other countries, the Brazilian government implemented a
series of measures. These included the addition of more than
200 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and the recruitment of
over 5,800 physicians for the Mais MÃ©dicos (More Doctors) Program,
with a focus on large urban centers characterized by high
population density. The government allocated US$ 2 billion to private
healthcare plans for investments in infrastructure and facilitated the acquisition
and distribution of 10 million rapid tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection
across states and municipalities. Furthermore, US$ 200 million was allocated
for the purchase of respirators, US$ 10 million for scientific
research, and US$ 0.9 billion was transferred from the Insurance
for Traffic Accidents fund to the Unified Health System (SUS).
Despite these interventions, the health system has not been able
to ensure comprehensive care for all citizens, and the risk
of system collapse remains significant and increasingly apparent.
