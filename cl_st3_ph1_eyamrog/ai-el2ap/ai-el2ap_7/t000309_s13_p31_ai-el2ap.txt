A study from China reported 917 children with confirmed COVID-19
infections, none of whom had a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD). In contrast, data from Korea indicated that among
8,413 children with confirmed COVID-19, 272 (3.2%) had IBD, and
nearly all of these patients (99.3%) continued their IBD treatment.
Among the 4.8% of children who postponed biological infusion therapy,
23% experienced an IBD flare.
