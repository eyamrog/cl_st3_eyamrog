From a social perspective, disinfection methods should be effective, simple,
inexpensive [3], non-toxic, and easily implemented [13]. Despite the existence
of these diverse and distinct criteria, there is a limited
number of studies worldwide dedicated to identifying the optimal disinfection
method [11]. The present results support this observation and provide
additional insight. Even when applying a single criterion—specifically, the type
of pacifier disinfection—while considering applicability and effectiveness, only eight studies
met the eligibility requirements over a twenty-year period. Furthermore, among
the included articles, only Brazil and South Africa appear to
have demonstrated significant concern regarding pacifier disinfection. The single article
from India was excluded from further consideration, as a full-text
review revealed it to be a duplicate of another included
study previously published in a different region. This finding underscores
the importance of conducting systematic reviews to critically assess the
content of published articles, verify their relevance, and synthesize findings,
as emphasized by previous authors [19].
