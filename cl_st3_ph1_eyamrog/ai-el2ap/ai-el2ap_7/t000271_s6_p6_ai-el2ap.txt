It is notable that our findings are consistent with several
established expectations. First, the observed increase in seroprevalence over time
aligns with the ongoing upward trend in the epidemic curve
in Rio de Janeiro over the past two months, during
which no significant decline has been detected [21]. Additionally, the
higher prevalence among younger individuals was anticipated, as this demographic
constitutes a substantial portion of the workforce and is therefore
more likely to be mobile and exposed to infection, even
in the context of social distancing measures. The elevated prevalence
among individuals with lower levels of formal education is also
consistent with expectations, as those in lower socioeconomic strata may
face greater challenges in adhering to social distancing guidelines due
to economic necessity. Furthermore, many individuals in this group reside
in crowded households and may lack access to piped water,
which impedes the implementation of basic hygiene practices. Supporting this,
a study conducted in the State of Cear√° found that
individuals with only primary education perceived themselves to be at
lower risk for COVID-19 and were less likely to engage
in voluntary quarantine compared to those with higher educational attainment
[25]. Finally, it was expected that blood donors residing in
condominiums would exhibit lower prevalence rates, as they are likely
to donate blood within their residential complexes and are presumably
more compliant with social distancing recommendations. In contrast, individuals donating
blood at Hemorio are more likely to do so while
traveling to the city center for work or other activities,
potentially increasing their exposure risk.
