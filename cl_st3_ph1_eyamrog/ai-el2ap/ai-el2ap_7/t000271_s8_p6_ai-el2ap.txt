Despite the importance of understanding SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in asymptomatic populations,
there are limited studies addressing this issue. One notable investigation
is the report from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where
Japanese health authorities conducted RT-PCR testing on 3,063 passengers following
an outbreak and estimated that 17.9% of all infected cases
were asymptomatic [13]. Additionally, a study conducted in Santa Clara
County, California, USA, reported a SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 2.8% after
adjusting for test sensitivity, specificity, and population demographics [14].
