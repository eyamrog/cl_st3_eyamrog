To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study to examine the associations between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA),
vigorous physical activity (VPA), moderate physical activity (MPA), and sedentary
behavior (SB) with the prevalence of depressive, anxiety, and co-occurring
depressive and anxiety (D&A) symptoms among adults in self-isolation during
the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, approximately 50% of participants
reported engaging in at least 30 minutes of MVPA per
day, and about one third reported spending 10 or more
hours per day in SB. The prevalence of depressive and
anxiety symptoms was around 40%, and one third of participants
reported co-occurring D&A symptoms. Individuals who reported at least 30
minutes of MVPA per day were approximately 30% less likely
to exhibit depressive, anxiety, and D&A symptoms after adjusting for
relevant covariates. Participants engaging in at least 15 minutes of
VPA per day were about 40% less likely to report
prevalent depressive and D&A symptoms, and 30% less likely to
report prevalent anxiety symptoms. Conversely, those who spent 10 or
more hours per day in SB were 39% more likely
to report prevalent depressive symptoms in adjusted models.
