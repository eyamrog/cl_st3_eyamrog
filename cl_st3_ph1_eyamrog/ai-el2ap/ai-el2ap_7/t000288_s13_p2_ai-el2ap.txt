This novel viral agent, which had not previously been identified
in humans, was designated as SARS-CoV-2 and is capable of
causing a respiratory infectious disease known as COVID-19. Prior outbreaks
of coronaviruses, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle
East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), resulted in 774 and 850 fatalities,
respectively, underscoring the severity of the threat and the necessity
for prompt control measures in response to this new outbreak.
