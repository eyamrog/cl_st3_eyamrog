As reported in previous studies conducted in the park (Struffaldi-De-Vuono
1985; Nastri et al. 1992; Knobel 1995; Gomes & Mantovani
2001; Tanus 2012), the tree community is characterized by smaller
individuals compared to other tropical forests, a pattern associated with
plant dynamics and growth rates (Lieberman et al. 1990; Condit
et al. 1999). A substantial proportion of specimens exhibited slow
growth (median = 0.58% year⁻¹, mean = 1.14% year⁻¹), which
is lower than that observed in another recovering area of
the same park (median = 0.72% year⁻¹, mean = 1.52%
year⁻¹; Gomes 1998). No significant differences in relative growth were
detected among size classes, despite trends reported in some studies
(Swaine et al. 1987; Silva et al. 1995; Gomes et
al. 2003). Growth patterns are influenced by the presence of
a continuous canopy and the predominance of small gaps in
the area (Costa & Mantovani 1992; Davinson 2009), as well
as by the abundance of late-successional species and understory individuals,
which typically exhibit slower growth rates (Worbes 1989; Welden et
al. 1991; Felfilli 1995; Condit et al. 1999). Lieberman et
al. (1990) also reported that many plants in Neotropical forests
showed no diameter growth over a 30-year period. Overall, growth
rates are highly variable and are influenced by environmental heterogeneity,
species-specific life history traits, and individual phenotypic variation (Swaine et
al. 1987; Worbes 1989; Sheil 1995a; Silva et al. 1995).
