The effectiveness and potential limitations of the reported method for
reducing aerosol dispersion remain uncertain and should be acknowledged. However,
there is a lack of studies with higher levels of
evidence on this topic. In the context of the current
COVID-19 pandemic, where uncertainties and limited high-quality information persist, the
dissemination of preliminary data or techniques may be valuable, provided
that the necessity for future, more rigorous studies is recognized.
