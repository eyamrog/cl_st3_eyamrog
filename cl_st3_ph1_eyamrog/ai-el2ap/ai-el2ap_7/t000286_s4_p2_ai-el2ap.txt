This study examines the relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI)
and economic conditions in Turkey from January 2010 to July
2016. This period is significant in the country's history due
to the presence of substantial global, regional, and domestic challenges
that impacted the Turkish economy. In particular, the aftermath of
the 2008 global financial crisis had widespread effects on economies
worldwide, including those of developing countries such as Turkey.
