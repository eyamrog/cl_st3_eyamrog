As the global incidence of COVID-19 continues to rise, concurrent
outbreaks of arboviral infections have placed additional strain on health
systems in tropical regions. The potential impact of a syndemic
involving both SARS-CoV-2 and arboviral infections on patient outcomes and
health system capacity remains unclear. Therefore, the objective of this
study is to systematically review the literature to identify and
synthesize evidence regarding the clinical presentation, severity, and prognosis of
coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and arboviruses.
