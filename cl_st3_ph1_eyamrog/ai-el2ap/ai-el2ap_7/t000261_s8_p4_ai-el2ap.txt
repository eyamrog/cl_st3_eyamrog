In 1997, a monthly water quality monitoring program was initiated
for the Garças Reservoir. Analysis of an eight-year time series
(1997–2004) identified two distinct limnological phases: one prior to and
one following the mechanical removal of the macrophyte Eichhornia crassipes
(Mart.) Solms. This intervention resulted in a rapid transition to
a hypertrophic state, characterized by persistent cyanobacterial blooms (Bicudo et
al. 2007) and an average reduction of 37% in phytoplankton
species richness (Crossetti et al. 2008). Subsequently, a 20-year study
(1997–2017) documented the invasion of the dinoflagellate Ceratium furcoides (Levander)
Langhans and identified the environmental variables associated with its establishment
and ecological success (Crossetti et al. 2019).
