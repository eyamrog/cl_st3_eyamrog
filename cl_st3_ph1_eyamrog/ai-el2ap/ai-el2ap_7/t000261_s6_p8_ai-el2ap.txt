In summary, eleven years after the permanent removal of macrophytes
in 1999, the current results indicate an improvement in the
health of the system. The reduction in internal phosphorus loading,
combined with the implementation of secondary sewage treatment from the
city zoo and the cessation of sewage discharge by the
State Department of Agriculture, has contributed to the maintenance of
the supereutrophic state. It is important to note that while
secondary sewage treatment effectively removes biodegradable organic matter (both dissolved
and suspended) and suspended solids, it does not eliminate dissolved
nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen. Therefore, to further advance
the recovery of the reservoir, it is essential to enhance
the sewage treatment processes at the city zoo, as this
has been the sole external source of phosphorus input to
Gar√ßas Reservoir since 2014.
