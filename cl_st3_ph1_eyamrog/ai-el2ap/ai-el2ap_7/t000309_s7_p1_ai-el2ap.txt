Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral respiratory illness caused
by the novel coronavirus identified in 2019 (2019-nCoV), which is
believed to have originated in bats (1). The 2019-nCoV is
a single-stranded RNA virus and was designated as severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the World Health Organization
(WHO) due to its genetic similarity to the virus responsible
for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2
began in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and subsequently spread
globally, including to Brazil. On March 11, 2020, the WHO
declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. As of this date, more
than one million confirmed cases and over 50,000 deaths have
been reported to the WHO worldwide. In Brazil, as of
April 4, 2020, there have been 10,278 confirmed cases and
432 deaths, with these numbers continuing to rise.
