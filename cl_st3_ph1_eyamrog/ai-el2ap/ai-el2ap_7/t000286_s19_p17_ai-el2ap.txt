The results indicate that INF does not Granger-cause GD, as
the null hypothesis is accepted at the 5% significance level,
with a probability value of 0.7060. Similarly, GD does not
Granger-cause INF, as evidenced by the acceptance of the null
hypothesis at the 5% significance level, with a probability value
of 0.7405 and an F-statistic of 0.3051. These findings suggest
the absence of causality between INF and GD in either
direction. Additionally, the results show that INT does not Granger-cause
GD, as the null hypothesis is accepted at the 5%
significance level, with a probability value of 0.5712.
