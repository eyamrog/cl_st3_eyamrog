Japan implemented rigorous surveillance to monitor the interval between the
onset of disease in primary (suspected) cases and its manifestation
in secondary (infected) cases in order to assess disease transmissibility.30-31
By systematically mapping data on suspected and infected individuals, authorities
were initially able to control the spread of the disease,
mitigate substantial pre-symptomatic transmission, and facilitate the early isolation of
individuals with COVID-19 in a population of approximately 120 million.
As a result, as of April 18, 2020, the number
of reported cases reached 10,300, with a total of 222
deaths.26
