A cloak or apron with a minimum weight of 30
g/m² should be used to prevent contamination of the skin
and clothing of healthcare professionals, who must wash their hands
after removal. A waterproof apron is recommended when caring for
individuals suspected or confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. The
necessity for a waterproof coat or apron with a minimum
weight of 50 g/m² should be evaluated based on the
patient’s clinical condition, such as the presence of vomiting, diarrhea,
orotracheal hypersecretion, or bleeding. The cloak or apron should have
long sleeves, a mesh or elastic cuff, and a rear
opening, and must be constructed from high-quality, non-toxic materials. After
use, the impermeable cloak or apron should be considered contaminated
and must be removed and discarded as infectious waste following
procedures involving patients with COVID-19, prior to exiting the isolation
room.
