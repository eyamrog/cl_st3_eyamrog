The normalized co-integrating coefficients for the two co-integrating equations, as
determined by the long-run relationship, are as follows: FDI is
the dependent variable, with coefficients of -0.001076 for GD, -0.240732
for INF, 0.213348 for INT, and -0.003069 for EXC. The
negative coefficients for GD, INF, and EXC indicate a negative
long-run relationship between these variables and FDI. In contrast, the
positive coefficient for INT suggests a positive long-run relationship between
INT and FDI.
