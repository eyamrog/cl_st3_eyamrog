BrushtoxÂ® is a solution containing activated ethanol (40% v/v) and
a biocide (parabens) that is considered effective for the decontamination
of toothbrushes from bacteria and fungi [23]. However, its efficacy
in pacifier decontamination remains controversial, as both positive [11] and
negative [10] outcomes have been reported. Consequently, it is important
to assess factors such as cost, accessibility, and potential disadvantages
that may restrict its widespread adoption by the general population
[27].
