Total tannin content was quantified using the method described by
Makkar and Becker (1993). A 4% (w/v) vanillin solution in
methanol was added to the extract, followed by the addition
of 1.5 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid (37%). The absorbance
of the resulting mixture was measured at 500 nm using
a Shimadzu UV mini-1240 spectrophotometer. Tannin concentration was determined by
interpolating the sample absorbance values against a calibration curve prepared
with catechin standards, and results were expressed as milligrams of
catechin equivalents per gram of extract.
