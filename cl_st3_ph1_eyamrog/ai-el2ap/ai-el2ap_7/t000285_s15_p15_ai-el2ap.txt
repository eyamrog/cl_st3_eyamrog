The critical appraisal of the included studies will be conducted
using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (7). The quality of evidence will
be evaluated according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development
and Evaluation (GRADE) approach (8). Two authors (NCJ and VTC)
will independently perform the critical appraisal and assess the certainty
of the evidence. Any disagreements regarding the appraisal or the
assessment of evidence certainty will be resolved through discussion, and,
if consensus cannot be reached, by consultation with a third
author (VFMT).
