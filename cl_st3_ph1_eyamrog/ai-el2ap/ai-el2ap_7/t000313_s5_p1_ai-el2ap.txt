Members of the Coronaviridae family are capable of infecting a
broad range of animal species, including humans, and are associated
with severe respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological diseases (Weiss and
Leibowitz, 2011). In humans, coronaviruses have primarily caused respiratory tract
infections and, for several decades, were regarded as having limited
clinical and epidemiological significance until the emergence of SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV outbreaks (Kuiken et al., 2003; Zaki et al., 2012).
Currently, SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19, a pandemic
that has posed significant challenges to public health systems worldwide.
The mortality associated with COVID-19 has already surpassed that of
diseases caused by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV combined, underscoring the critical
importance of this disease as a major public health issue
(WHO; https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019).
