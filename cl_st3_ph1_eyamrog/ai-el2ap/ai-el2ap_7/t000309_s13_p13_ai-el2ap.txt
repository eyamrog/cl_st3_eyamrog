At our infusion center, staff requested the identification of patients
whose infusions could be postponed by one or two weeks
to facilitate the rearrangement of seating and increase available space.
The primary criterion for rescheduling was deep clinical and endoscopic
remission, as determined at the most recent outpatient clinic assessment.
During infusions, a minimum distance of approximately 1.5 meters between
seats was maintained, and accompanying persons were not permitted. Although
the use of surgical masks is recommended for immunodeficient patients,
mask availability was inconsistent. Consequently, a screening protocol involving a
structured interview was implemented prior to admission to systematically assess
for acute respiratory symptoms, including cough, dyspnea, or fever, in
both IBD patients and their contacts. Asymptomatic patients received intravenous
infusions as scheduled, while those with symptoms highly suggestive of
coronavirus infection were referred to the emergency department. In cases
where initiation of biologic therapy was deemed essential and feasible,
preference was given to biologics that could be administered subcutaneously
at home rather than intravenously at the infusion center.
