Fatality rates have varied substantially among countries, and possible explanations
include differences in test accuracy and testing strategies for SARS-CoV-2.
For instance, in Brazil, test availability is currently limited, and
testing is prioritized for patients exhibiting more severe clinical symptoms
who are suspected of having COVID-19. In contrast, countries such
as the Republic of Korea have implemented widespread testing for
SARS-CoV-2. As a result, many patients with mild symptoms—who constitute
approximately 80% of SARS-CoV-2 infections and would likely not be
tested in Brazil—were identified and included in the case count
in Korea. This broader testing approach is associated with a
lower reported case-fatality rate in Korea (1%) compared to Brazil
(6.1%). Consequently, the actual overall mortality rate may be closer
to the estimate observed in Korea than that reported in
Brazil.
