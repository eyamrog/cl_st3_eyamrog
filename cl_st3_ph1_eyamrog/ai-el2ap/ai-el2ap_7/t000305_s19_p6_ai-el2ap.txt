A notable finding emerges when comparing groups 3 and 4.
Group 3 exhibits an incidence rate that is 3.12 times
higher and a mortality coefficient that is 43% lower (p
< 0.001) than group 4. This pattern may indicate a
greater diagnostic capacity in the country associated with group 3,
resulting in the identification of more cases with comparatively lower
severity.
