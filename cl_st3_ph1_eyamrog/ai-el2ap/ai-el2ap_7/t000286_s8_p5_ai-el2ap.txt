Financial investment refers to the allocation of funds into securities
such as shares, bonds, and other financial instruments commonly classified
as "IOUs," which represent documented claims that one economic agent
holds over another. Investment inflows are essential to the functioning
of an economy, regardless of its level of development. The
economic growth of most countries is largely driven by the
volume and effectiveness of such investment inflows.
