The variation in author productivity can be partially attributed to
the specific context of each individual. While author productivity is
not inherently associated with collaborative authorship, collaboration may affect an
author's output within a particular timeframe, as observed in this
study when considering both authors and co-authors. This contextual influence
may account for the observed patterns in this research, including
the applicability of the inverse square law and the identification
of an elite group of authors.
