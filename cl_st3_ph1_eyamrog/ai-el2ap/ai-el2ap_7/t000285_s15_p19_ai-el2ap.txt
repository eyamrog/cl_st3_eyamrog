For studies that do not report a mean and corresponding
standard deviation (SD), we will extract relevant information and results
from the text or tables to infer these values where
possible. If the specified parameters are unavailable, we will estimate
them using alternative reported statistics, ensuring that the most accurate
and reliable information is obtained.
