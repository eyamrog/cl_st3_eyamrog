South Korea reported its first COVID-19 case on January 20,
2020, and subsequently implemented contact management protocols between suspected and
confirmed cases to facilitate epidemiological investigations. The country established a
system to assess exposure risk among individuals present in locations
visited by confirmed cases after symptom onset, and classified contacts
according to their level of risk. Additionally, disinfection procedures were
conducted in areas potentially contaminated by confirmed patients to minimize
the risk of environmental transmission. These systematic investigations were supported
by a rigorous control process grounded in scientific principles and
ongoing feedback assessment cycles, which contributed to effective outbreak containment.
As of April 18, although the cumulative number of cases
exceeded 10,600, the incidence of new infections had declined substantially
in recent weeks.
