The first confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in
Brazil and Latin America was reported on February 26, 2020,
in SÃ£o Paulo. The emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has exerted significant pressure on healthcare systems
globally. Asymptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs) represent a potential source of
SARS-CoV-2 transmission, particularly to immunocompromised oncology patients. Systematic screening of
these HCWs may contribute to the containment of transmission by
enabling the identification and isolation of individuals who are infected.
