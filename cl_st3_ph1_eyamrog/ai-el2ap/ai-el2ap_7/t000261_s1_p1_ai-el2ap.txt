The history of the Garças Reservoir provides a clear example
of anthropogenic impacts resulting from urbanization during the 20th century.
This shallow tropical reservoir is situated within the Parque Estadual
das Fontes do Ipiranga, a protected area in the city
of São Paulo, São Paulo State, Brazil. Utilizing a comprehensive
dataset spanning from 1997 to 2017, we assessed temporal changes
in water quality using the trophic state index (TSI) and
evaluated the effectiveness of management interventions. The mechanical removal of
macrophytes in 1999 led to a rapid transition from eutrophic-supereutrophic
to hypereutrophic conditions, driven by internal feedback mechanisms. Five years
later, in 2005, a reduction in internal phosphorus loading was
observed, followed by the implementation of secondary wastewater treatment at
the city zoo in 2007, both of which contributed to
initial improvements in water quality. In 2011, the TSI decreased
to the supereutrophic range following the temporary diversion of sewage
effluent from the São Paulo State Department of Agriculture, and
this effluent was permanently discontinued in 2014, allowing the reservoir
to maintain a supereutrophic state. The TSI effectively reflected key
historical events related to sewage effluent management. Eleven years after
the significant impact of macrophyte removal, current data indicate an
improvement in the reservoir’s ecological condition. However, further enhancement of
sewage treatment at the city zoo is essential for continued
recovery, as this source has been the sole external phosphorus
input since 2014. The case of Garças Reservoir contributes to
a better understanding of the consequences of inadequate management strategies
and highlights the susceptibility of tropical shallow systems to eutrophication.
