In this study, Fabaceae, a family typically associated with early
successional stages and seasonal forests, was not among the three
most species-rich or abundant families, which contrasts with findings from
previous studies conducted in the same park (Struffaldi-De-Vuono 1985; Nastri
et al. 1992; Gomes & Mantovani 2001; Pivello & Peccinini
2002; Eisenlohr et al. 2009; Hirata et al. 2010; Tanus
et al. 2012). Similarly, Euphorbiaceae was not among the most
represented families. The study area is characterized by a more
advanced successional stage, as indicated by the low abundance and
species richness of early-successional taxa such as Machaerium (Fabaceae) and
Alchornea (Euphorbiaceae), which are more prevalent in less mature areas
of the park. The observed higher recruitment and predominance of
late-successional species, along with increased mortality among early-successional species, suggest
ongoing forest regeneration, consistent with results from Gomes et al.
(2003) but differing from patterns reported in other areas of
the park (Struffaldi-De-Vuono 1985; Knobel 1995).
