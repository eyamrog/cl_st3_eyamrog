The Durbin-Watson statistic of 2.578326 indicates the presence of negative
serial autocorrelation in the model residuals. The unit root test
results show that the variables GD, INF, and INT are
stationary at level, or integrated of order zero [I(0)], as
their respective Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test statistics (4.180454, 3.173179, and
5.591438) exceed the 0.05 critical values (3.02997, 2.991878, and 3.004861).
In contrast, the variables FDI and EXC are stationary at
first difference, as their ADF test statistics (10.14302 and 3.996066)
are greater than the 0.05 critical value of 2.998064.
