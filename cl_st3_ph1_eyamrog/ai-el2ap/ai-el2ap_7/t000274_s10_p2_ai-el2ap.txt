Health professionals working in emergency rooms or with acute care
patients must modify their procedures to minimize the risk of
contamination and disease transmission. As of early March, China reported
over 3,300 infected healthcare workers and at least 22 related
deaths. Adherence to protective guidelines for invasive procedures is essential
for emergency professionals and surgeons during this period.
