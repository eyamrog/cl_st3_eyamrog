Secondary forests undergoing various stages of regeneration, as well as
disturbed forests, represent some of the principal remaining ecosystems derived
from tropical forests. A significant proportion of biodiversity, including endangered
and rare species, is confined to fragments of these forests
(Brown & Lugo 1990; FAO 2010; Farah et al. 2017).
Variability in disturbance histories, local environmental conditions, and resource availability
has influenced the trajectories of these ecosystems in ways that
are not yet fully understood, complicating efforts to predict their
development and to implement effective management strategies (Chazdon et al.
2007; Rodrigues et al. 2009; Norden et al. 2009). An
illustrative case is the Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga
(PEFI), which constitutes the largest remnant of Atlantic Forest entirely
surrounded by urban development in the Metropolitan Region of SÃ£o
Paulo, one of the most densely populated areas globally (SMA
2008).
