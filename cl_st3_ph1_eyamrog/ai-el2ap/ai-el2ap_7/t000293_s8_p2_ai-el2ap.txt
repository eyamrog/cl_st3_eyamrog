Several studies have described the imaging characteristics of this disease,
with particular focus on high-resolution computed tomography (CT) of the
chest (3â€“18). Although chest CT is not currently recommended as
a routine tool for screening or initial diagnosis of COVID-19,
it can provide valuable information regarding disease severity, treatment response,
the presence of complications, and differential diagnoses (19). Only a
limited number of studies have assessed the diagnostic accuracy of
chest CT for screening patients with suspected COVID-19 (11,17,18). Such
analyses are important, especially in contexts where other endemic and
seasonal viruses are present and where access to serological testing
(PCR) is limited or results are delayed.
