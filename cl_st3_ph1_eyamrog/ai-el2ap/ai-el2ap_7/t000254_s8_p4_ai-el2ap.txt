Variations in the dynamics of plant communities can be assessed
and monitored through the use of permanent transects established in
environments with differing histories of disturbance (Gomes & Mantovani 2001,
Oliveira 2001). Numerous studies conducted in tropical forests have quantified
tree mortality and recruitment rates to obtain data on community
dynamics and structure (Phillips & Gentry 1994, Sheil 1995a,b, Gomes
et al. 2003, Oliveira-Filho et al. 2007, Machado & Oliveira-Filho
2010, Laurance et al. 2014). However, most of these studies
have been conducted in continuous, well-preserved forests and have primarily
focused on tree species (Gomes 1998).
