Furthermore, the widespread availability of antibody testing and the implementation
of universal testing for healthcare workers (HCWs) could significantly impact
infection control by: (1) reducing in-hospital transmission; (2) decreasing the
risk of asymptomatic transmission during periods of social distancing; (3)
supporting the wellbeing of HCWs by ensuring that infected individuals
are promptly identified and isolated; and (4) allowing healthcare services
to isolate only those who require it, thereby minimizing staff
shortages due to unnecessary self-isolation or widespread contamination among HCWs.
