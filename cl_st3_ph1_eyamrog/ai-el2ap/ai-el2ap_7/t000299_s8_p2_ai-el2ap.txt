Currently, humanity faces the challenge of coexisting with the novel
coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Although children are often asymptomatic for COVID-19, particular
attention should be given to younger children, as the incidence
of cases in this group remains significant. This is partly
because young children typically do not wear masks and have
not adopted other specific preventive and control measures [5]. Additionally,
pacifiers may serve as a potential route of transmission due
to their frequent and close contact with the mouth and
face. Pacifiers are exposed to saliva and oral microbiota, facilitating
the formation of microbial biofilms on their surfaces [4,6,7]. Frequent
drops of pacifiers further increase their exposure to a variety
of microorganisms, and they are often returned to the mouth
without adequate cleaning or disinfection [4]. Furthermore, pacifier use has
been associated with other diseases and conditions in children, including
fungal infections [7] and intestinal parasitosis [4].
