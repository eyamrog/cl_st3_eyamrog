Ideally, investment inflows can be categorized into two forms: capital
(real) investment and financial investment. Capital investment inflows pertain to
tangible assets, which are formalized through agreements and materialize as
projects or collections of assets, including individual or fixed assets
such as machinery and buildings. In other words, capital investment
refers to total expenditure on new plants and equipment, primarily
undertaken with the objective of reducing costs and producing goods
to generate future economic benefits.
