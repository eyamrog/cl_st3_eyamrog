The results indicate a negative relationship between the general economic
situation index and the optimal macroeconomic uncertainty index. In relation
to this topic, Kalyoncu (2009) investigated the sensitivity of purchasing
power parity (PPP) and its validity by applying unit root
tests to data from Turkey and its major trading partners,
including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, and the United
Kingdom. The findings demonstrate a significant correlation between the validity
of PPP and the level of trade for each country
in the sample. Regarding the literature on the impact of
foreign exchange and tourism on Turkey's GDP, Arslant√ºrk and Atan
(2012) examined the effects of these variables using data from
1987 to 2009. They employed co-integration and Granger causality models
to assess the relationships among the variables. Their results reveal
a positive relationship between tourism income and GDP growth, indicating
that increases in tourism income are associated with economic growth.
