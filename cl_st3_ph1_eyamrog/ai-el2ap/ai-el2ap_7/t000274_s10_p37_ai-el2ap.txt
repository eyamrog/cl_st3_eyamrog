An HME (heat and moisture exchanger) filter should be placed
on the tracheostomy to minimize viral exposure in the event
of disconnection. As an alternative for both elective and emergency
procedures, an extension can be used that is initially occluded
with the plunger of a syringe; forceps are then applied
to maintain occlusion, after which the plunger is removed and
the extension is connected to the mechanical ventilation system (see
Figure 2).
