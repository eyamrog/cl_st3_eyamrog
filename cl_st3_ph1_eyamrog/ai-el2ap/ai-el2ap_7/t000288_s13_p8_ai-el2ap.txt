Current epidemiological investigations indicate that the incubation period of COVID-19
ranges from 1 to 14 days, with most cases occurring
between 3 and 7 days, and individuals can be contagious
during the latency period. The virus demonstrates high transmissibility among
humans, particularly affecting elderly individuals and those with pre-existing medical
conditions. Common symptoms in patients with COVID-19 include fever, malaise,
and cough, and the majority of adults and children experience
mild, influenza-like symptoms. Nevertheless, a subset of patients may progress
to severe disease, developing acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure,
multiple organ dysfunction, and, in some cases, death. Despite ongoing
research, significant gaps remain in understanding the epidemiology and clinical
characteristics of COVID-19, such as the precise incubation period, the
potential for transmission by asymptomatic carriers, and the exact rate
of transmissibility. However, human-to-human transmission has been conclusively demonstrated and
is recognized as the primary driver of the ongoing spread
of the disease.
