Although our data are cross-sectional and do not allow for
determination of causality, previous longitudinal studies, Mendelian randomization analyses, and
randomized controlled trials provide evidence that moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA)
may protect against and ameliorate depressive and anxiety symptoms. If
MVPA is indeed protective, several mechanisms may underlie these effects.
First, MVPA has been shown to increase the release of
endocannabinoids, which are associated with antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. Second,
MVPA enhances neuroplasticity and brain function, as indicated by increased
levels of neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),
which are implicated in the antidepressant effects of exercise. Third,
MVPA may strengthen anti-inflammatory and antioxidant systems, which are often
compromised in individuals with depressive and anxiety disorders. Conversely, randomized
controlled trials have demonstrated that increased sedentary behavior (SB) can
elevate depressive symptoms, partially mediated by increased inflammatory markers. Fourth,
engagement in MVPA may reduce exposure to anxiogenic content, such
as information about infection risks and other stressors encountered during
self-isolation, by occupying time and attention that might otherwise be
spent ruminating on such information. Fifth, psychosocial mechanisms, including increased
social connectivity, may contribute to the antidepressant effects of exercise,
as individuals who are more physically active may participate in
group activities or experience positive affect through social interaction, including
online platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, evidence suggests a
bidirectional relationship between MVPA, SB, and depressive and anxiety symptoms,
indicating that individuals with these symptoms are less likely to
be physically active and more likely to engage in sedentary
behavior.
