The World Health Organization has indicated that reducing the transmission
rate of the virus, as well as controlling and decreasing
the number of cases and deaths associated with the pandemic,
can only be achieved through widespread implementation of key public
health measures, including hand hygiene, use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers,
adherence to cough etiquette, regular cleaning of surfaces, avoidance of
large gatherings, and social distancing. Analysis of the epidemiological curve
demonstrates that countries such as Italy, Spain, and the United
States experienced significantly higher mortality rates compared to China, primarily
due to delays in the adoption of these preventive measures.
In Brazil, the rapid increase in cases relative to both
global and Latin American trends suggests a substantial rise in
the number of infections.
