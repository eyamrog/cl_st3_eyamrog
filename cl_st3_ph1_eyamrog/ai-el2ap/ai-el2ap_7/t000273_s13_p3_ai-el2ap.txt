While considerable attention has been directed toward the hospital network,
Primary Health Care (PHC) has received comparatively little focus. In
Brazil's COVID-19 response plan, there is no explicit mention of
investment in or strengthening of this component of the health
system. The lack of emphasis on PHC may undermine the
overall effectiveness of the response, potentially accelerating the risk of
health system collapse as COVID-19 cases increase in the country.
