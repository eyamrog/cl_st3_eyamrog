The dental profession, which is predominantly composed of self-employed practitioners,
should address the topic of financial education, a subject often
underrepresented in academic curricula. There is a notable lack of
scholarly literature focused on financial education specifically for dental practices.
Key recommendations for this group should include the establishment of
an emergency financial reserve, appropriate selection of financial institutions for
these reserves, long-term investment strategies, and consideration of both public
and private pension plans. Other professional sectors are also emphasizing
the importance of these issues in the current context, aiming
to enhance social security beyond the provisions offered by government
programs. Such financial strategies should be sustainable and oriented toward
long-term stability, with the objective of safeguarding self-employed professionals and
mitigating the risk of significant economic challenges.
