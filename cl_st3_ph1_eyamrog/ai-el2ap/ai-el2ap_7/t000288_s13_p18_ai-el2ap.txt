Several dental procedures, such as the use of high-speed handpieces
or ultrasonic scalers, generate aerosols—small particles or droplets—that can be
inhaled, absorbed through the skin, or deposited on nearby surfaces.
According to the most recent Scientific Brief published by the
World Health Organization, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur via respiratory
droplets from direct contact with an infected individual (at a
distance of less than 1 meter), indirect contact with contaminated
surfaces or objects, and aerosols produced during procedures performed on
infected patients. Consequently, dental and health organizations have recommended postponing
all elective dental treatments and non-essential procedures, restricting services to
urgent and emergency visits only. Dental health care personnel (DHCP)
should be knowledgeable about the mechanisms of transmission, adhere to
enhanced infection control procedures, be able to identify patients exhibiting
signs or symptoms of COVID-19, and clearly distinguish between dental
emergencies, urgent dental care, and non-emergency dental treatments.
