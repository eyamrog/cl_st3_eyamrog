In Europe, of the eight patients included, seven were from
the Porto-IBD cohort and one adolescent (17 years old) was
identified through the SECURE-IBD database. The majority of these patients
had Crohnâ€™s disease, and most were either in deep remission
or exhibited a moderate disease activity index; only one patient
had a comorbid cardiovascular condition. Nearly all patients had a
confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, presenting with mild symptoms such as
fever, cough, and fatigue, and notably, none of the eight
patients experienced diarrhea.
