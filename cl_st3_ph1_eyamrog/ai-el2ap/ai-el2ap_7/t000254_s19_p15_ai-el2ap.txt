A comparison of the dynamics of both successional plant groups
with a diameter at breast height (dbh) of less than
2.5 cm revealed no significant differences in annual mortality rates
between the groups (Mann-Whitney Test, U = 31, p =
0.16). In contrast, the annual recruitment rate of late-successional plants
was significantly higher than that of early-successional plants (U =
11.5, p = 0.003; see Figure 5).
