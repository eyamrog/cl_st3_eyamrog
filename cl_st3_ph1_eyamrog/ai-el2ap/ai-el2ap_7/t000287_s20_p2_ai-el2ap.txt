Among the three asymptomatic healthcare workers, two exhibited positive IgM
and negative IgG results, while one demonstrated positive results for
both IgM and IgG. One individual required retesting after one
week due to an initial indeterminate result and subsequently tested
positive for IgM and negative for IgG. The only confirmed
symptomatic case was negative for both IgM and IgG but
tested positive by RT-PCR.
