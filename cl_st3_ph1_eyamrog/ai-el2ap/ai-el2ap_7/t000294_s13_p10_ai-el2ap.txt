This measure can help reduce the transmission of respiratory diseases,
including the novel coronavirus. However, mask use alone does not
provide an adequate level of protection and should always be
combined with other recommended practices, such as hand hygiene, particularly
before and after handling masks. Additionally, the use of masks
when not indicated may result in unnecessary costs and may
contribute to a false sense of security, potentially leading to
reduced adherence to other preventive measures, such as hand hygiene
and the cleaning of inanimate surfaces that may be contaminated
with SARS-CoV-2.
