In general, patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who are
receiving immunomodulators may have an increased susceptibility to infections, particularly
when these agents are used in combination with biologic therapies
such as anti-TNF agents. Additionally, factors including malnutrition, the presence
of comorbidities, advanced age, a prior history of serious infections,
and active underlying IBD may also contribute to an elevated
risk of infection (14,15).
