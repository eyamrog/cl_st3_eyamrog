There is evidence to suggest that strengthening primary health care
(PHC) during the current pandemic may serve as an effective
strategy. The Family Health Strategy (ESF), originally established as the
Family Health Program (PSF) in the early 1990s, has been
the principal mechanism for restructuring healthcare delivery and consolidating PHC
in Brazil. In 1998, Brazil had 2,054 family health teams;
by 2017, this number had increased to 41,619, providing coverage
to approximately 70% of the Brazilian population, or about 143
million individuals. The Mais MÃ©dicos (More Doctors) Program contributed to
a rapid expansion of family health coverage between 2014 and
2017, with coverage increasing from 66.9% to 70.0%. The PHC
workforce during this period included more than 36,000 health posts,
63,000 physicians, 70,000 nurses, 263,000 community health workers, and 26,000
oral health teams.
