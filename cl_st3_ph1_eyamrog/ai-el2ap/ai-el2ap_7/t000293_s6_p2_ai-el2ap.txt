Our data provide clinical evidence supporting the use of chest
CT as an alternative triage tool in resource-constrained settings for
patients with suspected COVID-19 infection. This aligns with a recent
statement from the Fleischner Society, which recommended that chest CT
may be indicated for the medical triage of patients with
suspected COVID-19 who exhibit moderate to severe clinical features and
have a high pre-test probability of disease, particularly in situations
where rapid point-of-care COVID-19 testing is unavailable (19).
