Following virus isolation in the initial cases, researchers identified a
genetic mutation in the spike surface protein, which the virus
utilizes to enter human cells and replicate.3 Subsequently, studies described
the incubation period as ranging from two to ten days
and established that transmission occurs via contaminated droplets, hands, and
surfaces.4-5 News reports rapidly documented increases in the number of
infected individuals, fatalities, and a high rate of transmission in
Wuhan, where early control measures included the suspension of public
transportation, closure of entertainment venues, prohibition of public gatherings, disinfection
of buildings and streets, and mandatory home confinement for all
residents.6 The spread of cases to other geographic regions was
significantly accelerated by globalization and the initial lack of knowledge
regarding the implementation of travel restrictions. Initially, there were numerous
uncertainties and limited information, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO)
to actively monitor cases and the global spread of the
virus. Subsequent research confirmed human-to-human transmission of n-COVID-19, thereby clarifying
the epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak.7
