This emerging health issue originated in a public market in
Wuhan, China, where live animals are kept and traded. It
attracted global attention following the outbreak of pneumonia of unknown
etiology. Initially, these pneumonia cases were monitored and subjected to
laboratory testing for coronaviruses and potential influenza infections. On January
7, 2020, Chinese authorities reported the isolation of a novel
coronavirus, designated as nCoV.
