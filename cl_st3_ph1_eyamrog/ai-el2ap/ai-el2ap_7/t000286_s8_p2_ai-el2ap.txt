In the literature examining the relationship between FDI inflows and
exchange rates, Cushman (1985) investigated the interactions among FDI inflows,
risk levels, and exchange rate regimes. To control for the
effects of inflation, Cushman utilized the real exchange rate rather
than the nominal exchange rate in his analysis. The results
based on U.S. annual data indicate that a sustained decrease
in FDI inflows is associated with a significant increase in
risk. This relationship is also observed in the context of
Turkey, where the substantial decline in FDI inflows in 2009
corresponded with an elevated risk factor for the real exchange
rate.
