Viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade host immune detection and
suppress the interferon (IFN) response. Specifically, viral proteins can disrupt
pattern recognition receptor (PRR) signaling pathways, thereby providing an early
advantage against host defenses. For instance, the nucleocapsid (N) protein
of SARS-CoV inhibits RIG-I ubiquitination, resulting in reduced type I
IFN production. Additionally, the membrane (M) protein of SARS-CoV prevents
the formation of the TRAF3/TBK1 complex and inhibits TBK1/IKKÎµ-dependent activation
of the IRF3 and IRF7 transcription factors. Furthermore, the nonstructural
protein 1 (nsp1) of SARS-CoV induces repressive modifications that block
host mRNA translation and promote host mRNA degradation.
