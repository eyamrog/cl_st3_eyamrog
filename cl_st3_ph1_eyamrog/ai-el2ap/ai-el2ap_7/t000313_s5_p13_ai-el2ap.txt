Conversely, closely related species may exhibit comparable levels of susceptibility
to a pathogen, independent of their phylogenetic distance from the
pathogenâ€™s primary host (Longdon et al., 2014). Given the high
degree of homology between the ACE2 orthologues of great apes
and the human ACE2 at the 30 binding sites analyzed
in this study, it is plausible that only great apes
are naturally and equally susceptible to developing symptoms of COVID-19,
a concern previously highlighted by the Great Ape Health Consortium
(Gillespie and Leendertz, 2020).
