At the beginning of 2020, a novel pneumonia outbreak caused
by a variant of coronavirus emerged, with the first reported
case in December 2019 in Wuhan, China.1 The rapid increase
in cases led to the classification of the situation as
an outbreak, and by the end of January 2020, the
World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a public health emergency
of international concern.1 Coronaviruses were first isolated in 1937 and
were named in 1965 due to their crown-like appearance under
electron microscopy.2 Previous significant outbreaks caused by coronaviruses include Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) in 2002–2003, resulting in 774 deaths,
and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) in 2012, with 858
confirmed deaths in Saudi Arabia.2 In 2019–2020, a new mutating
RNA coronavirus emerged, characterized by higher transmissibility and a greater
proportion of asymptomatic cases compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, although
generally associated with milder symptoms, leading to substantial impacts on
global health systems.1 Coronaviruses commonly infect humans throughout life, particularly
in children, with α-coronaviruses 229E and NL63, and β-coronaviruses OC43
and HKU1 being the most frequently identified.2 However, these viruses
can occasionally cause severe respiratory illness in older adults and
immunocompromised individuals.2-3
