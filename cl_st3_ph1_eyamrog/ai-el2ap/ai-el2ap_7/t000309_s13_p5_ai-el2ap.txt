Guan et al. did not identify the use of immunomodulators
as a risk factor for severe disease in a cohort
of 1,099 patients in China (18). As of April 3,
2020, the international Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion
(SECURE-IBD) database reported 12 deaths (9 male) among 275 patients
with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and COVID-19. Among these, three
patients were under 65 years of age, and all had
received combination therapy with more than one immunosuppressant (steroid plus
JAK inhibitor; adalimumab plus methotrexate; adalimumab plus azathioprine plus steroid)
(19). However, these findings should be interpreted with caution, as
many patients with mild disease were not tested for COVID-19.
