During the preparation of this article, a paper was published
in which the authors conducted an analysis up to March
21 and reported similar correlations between the importance of BCG
vaccination and both the incidence and lethality of COVID-19. Although
the data sources were comparable, the present study utilized initial
acceleration rates for the number of cases and deaths (from
0 to 100) as well as subsequent acceleration rates (from
101 cases or deaths to April 11). The authors plan
to extend this analysis by examining acceleration rates from April
11 to May 11, and subsequently from May 11 to
June 11.
