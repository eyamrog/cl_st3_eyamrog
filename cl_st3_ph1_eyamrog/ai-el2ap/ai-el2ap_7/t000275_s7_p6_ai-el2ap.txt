This article presents a simple and reproducible technique, utilizing commonly
available materials, that can be implemented for surgical patients undergoing
laparoscopic or robotic procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the
current context, there is a lack of robust evidence regarding
the effectiveness of various measures to reduce viral transmission and
the outcomes of different interventions. Nevertheless, several recommendations have been
proposed to mitigate the potential spread of the virus. The
adaptation described herein is specifically designed to minimize aerosol dispersion
during surgical procedures, with the objective of protecting healthcare professionals.
