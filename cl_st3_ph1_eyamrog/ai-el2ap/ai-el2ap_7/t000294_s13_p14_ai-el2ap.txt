Following the recommendation for mask use among healthcare professionals, there
was a significant increase in demand for masks by the
general population, resulting in shortages for health services responsible for
the care of patients with COVID-19. On April 2, 2020,
the Ministry of Health of Brazil began recommending the use
of masks made from cotton, non-woven textiles, and similar materials
for individuals who are in contact with suspected cases at
home or who need to leave their residence for activities
that may involve interaction with others, with the intention that
masks serve as a mechanical barrier. However, it remains essential
to adhere to other established preventive measures, such as social
distancing, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, and mouth, and practicing
proper hand hygiene. The recommendation for fabric mask use is
based on evidence that such masks can reduce the spread
of the virus by asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals who may
unknowingly transmit the virus; however, these masks do not protect
the wearer, as they lack the capacity to filter microorganisms.
It is important to emphasize that fabric masks are for
individual use only and must not be shared. Furthermore, according
to Technical Note 4/2020 from the Brazilian National Health Surveillance
Agency (ANVISA), fabric masks should not be used in healthcare
settings under any circumstances.
