The observed differences in the 30 key ACE2 binding sites
involved in interactions with SARS-CoV-like viruses across various species and
taxonomic groups are notable and may influence the ability of
SARS-CoV-2 to bind to ACE2 in certain species. Recent predictions
regarding the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to infect 42 additional mammalian
species were based on amino acid variations at positions 31,
35, 38, 82, and 353 in ACE2 orthologues relative to
human ACE2 (Luan et al., 2020). According to these findings,
76% of the mammalian species examined, including domestic animals such
as dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) and cats (Felis catus), as
well as horses (Equus caballus), cattle (Bos taurus), and sheep
(Ovis aries), may possess ACE2 receptors capable of binding the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 is a "generalist"
coronavirus, with the potential to infect a broad range of
mammalian species such as pigs, ferrets, cats, orangutans, and monkeys,
has also been proposed by other researchers, despite the observed
differences in their respective ACE2 orthologues (Wan et al., 2020).
