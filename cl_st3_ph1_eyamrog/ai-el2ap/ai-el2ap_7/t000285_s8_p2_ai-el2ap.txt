In this context, countries in tropical regions continue to experience
challenges related to longstanding endemic diseases. For example, in Brazil,
by mid-March 2020, more than 600,000 probable cases of dengue,
nearly 18,000 probable cases of chikungunya, and over 2,000 probable
cases of Zika virus infection were reported. The combined mortality
associated with these urban arboviral diseases reached 224 deaths during
this period.
