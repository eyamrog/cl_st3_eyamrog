During the COVID-19 pandemic, dental care health professionals (DCHP) should
utilize telecommunication or teledentistry prior to in-person dental treatment to
assess patient needs and reduce the risk of infection. This
assessment should include screening for symptoms such as fever, cough,
or shortness of breath, as recommended by the American Dental
Association (ADA), as well as recent national or international travel,
in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
guidelines. When appropriate, dentists should provide advice, prescribe analgesics and/or
antimicrobials, and postpone in-person visits, while maintaining direct communication with
patients via phone or text message. If a patient presents
with a dental emergency that is potentially life-threatening, such as
uncontrolled bleeding, or an urgent dental need involving severe pain
or risk of infection, and also exhibits signs or symptoms
of respiratory infection, the patient should not be treated in
a dental office but should instead be referred to an
emergency care facility equipped with Transmission-Based Precautions, such as N95
masks and Airborne Infection Isolation Rooms, as recommended by the
ADA.
