Plankton, periphyton, and surface sediment samples were collected following standard
procedures. Plankton samples were obtained using a cone-shaped net constructed
from approximately 20 Âµm mesh nylon fabric, which was repeatedly
passed through the upper 30 cm of the water column
until a macroscopically detectable quantity of material accumulated in the
collection flask attached to the net. Water column samples from
depths below the surface to near the bottom were collected
using a van Dorn sampler. Periphyton samples were collected by
harvesting littoral plant specimens, which were scraped either in the
field or in the laboratory using a razor blade or
a marten-hair brush to obtain material closely adhered to the
substrate; in some cases, plant specimens were manually squeezed to
extract loosely attached material. Algae inhabiting ravines among bryophytes or
ferns were sampled using suction pipettes. Additionally, rocks, tree trunks,
and cement walls were scraped with a spatula typically used
for removing wall paint to collect sufficient material for analysis.
Sediment samples from reservoir bottoms were also collected using a
van Dorn sampler. Detailed descriptions of all methods are provided
in Bicudo & Menezes (2017).
