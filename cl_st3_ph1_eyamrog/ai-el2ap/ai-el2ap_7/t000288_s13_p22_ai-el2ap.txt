Intraoral radiographs should be avoided due to the potential to
induce coughing. The presence in the office should be restricted
to the patient, the operator, and the dental assistant. Following
treatment, dental care health professionals should wear appropriate personal protective
equipment (PPE) while cleaning and disinfecting the room and equipment,
utilizing recommended disinfectant products. Additionally, dentists should reconsider the use
of sedation, both inhalation and pharmacological, for managing severe anxiety
or phobia in dental settings, and instead prioritize non-pharmacological techniques
to reduce the risk of requiring life support measures that
may involve airway manipulation and aerosol generation.
