The PEFI has been subject to various disturbances, including fragmentation,
isolation, biological invasion, fires, pollution, edge effects, and the urban
heat island phenomenon (Struffaldi-De-Vuono 1985; Gomes et al. 2003; SMA
2008), as well as significant climate changes over the past
85 years (EM-IAG 2017). Research on plant communities across different
areas of PEFI has documented a heterogeneous vegetation cover, characterized
by patches of heavily impacted forest (Struffaldi-De-Vuono 1985; Costa &
Mantovani 1992; Gomes & Mantovani 2001; Pivello & Peccinini 2002;
Gomes et al. 2003; Davison 2009; Eisenlohr et al. 2009;
Hirata et al. 2010; Villagra & Romaniuc-Neto 2011; Tanus et
al. 2012), some of which are undergoing evident recovery processes,
while others remain relatively undisturbed (Pivello & Peccinini 2002; Gomes
et al. 2003).
