Time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was assessed using
two questions: (1) “How much time on an average day
have you spent in vigorous physical activity since self-isolating?” and
(2) “How much time on an average day have you
spent in moderate physical activity since self-isolating?” Each question was
accompanied by definitions specifying that vigorous physical activities require substantial
physical effort and result in breathing much harder than normal,
while moderate activities require moderate physical effort and cause breathing
to be somewhat harder than normal. For the logistic regression
models, MVPA, moderate physical activity (MPA), and vigorous physical activity
(VPA) during self-isolation were treated as dichotomous variables. MVPA and
MPA were categorized as either less than 30 minutes per
day or 30 minutes or more per day, while VPA
was categorized as either less than 15 minutes per day
or 15 minutes or more per day. These thresholds were
selected to align with public health recommendations of 150 minutes
of MVPA or 75 minutes of VPA per week.
