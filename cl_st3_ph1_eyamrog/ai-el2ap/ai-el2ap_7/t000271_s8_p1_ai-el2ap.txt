In December 2019, cases of severe pneumonia of unknown etiology
were reported in Wuhan, China. Following the identification of the
initial case, the outbreak rapidly disseminated both nationally and internationally.
The causative agent was identified as a betacoronavirus, designated as
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is responsible
for the clinical syndrome known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
[1].
