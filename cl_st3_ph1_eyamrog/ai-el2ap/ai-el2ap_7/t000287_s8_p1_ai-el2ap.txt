According to the World Health Organization, testing, diagnosing, and isolating
individuals are essential strategies for controlling the spread of Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its associated clinical
syndrome, coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Asymptomatic health-care workers (HCWs) represent a
potentially underestimated source of infection and should therefore be considered
for routine testing.
