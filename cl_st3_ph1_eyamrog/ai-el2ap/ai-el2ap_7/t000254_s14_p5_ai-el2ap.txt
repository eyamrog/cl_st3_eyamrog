All individuals were tagged with numbered plastic plates attached to
the stems using galvanized wire, ensuring sufficient space for plant
growth. The height of each individual was measured using a
graduated ruler and an electronic measuring tape. Diameter at breast
height (dbh) was recorded for all branches with a dbh
greater than 2.5 cm during late winter, specifically between the
second half of August and the first half of September
2012, which corresponds to the driest period of the year.
These measurements were conducted 6.5 years after the initial assessment
performed in March 2006 (Davison 2009).
