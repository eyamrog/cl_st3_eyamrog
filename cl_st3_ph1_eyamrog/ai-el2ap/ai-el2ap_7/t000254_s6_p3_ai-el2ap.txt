Of the 125 species identified in the shrub-tree synusia of
the study area, 12 are classified as either “Endangered” or
“Vulnerable” according to established conservation lists (Martinelli & Moraes 2013;
MMA 2014; SMA 2016; IUCN 2019). Notably, one Endangered species,
Eugenia pruinosa D.Legrand (Myrtaceae), is among the ten most abundant
species recorded. Additionally, the survey documented Gonatogyne brasiliensis (Baill.) Müll.
Arg. (Phyllanthaceae), a rare species with only 52 records for
the State of São Paulo (Arzolla 2011; CRIA 2019). These
findings underscore the role of secondary forest remnants, including urban
forests undergoing recovery, in providing habitat for rare and threatened
species (Brown & Lugo 1990; Norden et al. 2009; FAO
2010). A comparison between the species list generated in this
study and that of the Park Management Plan (SMA 2008)
revealed that 56 species identified here are not included in
the plan, five of which are classified in a threatened
category. These results provide important data to support the protection
of forest remnants and contribute to the ongoing update of
information for the Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga.
