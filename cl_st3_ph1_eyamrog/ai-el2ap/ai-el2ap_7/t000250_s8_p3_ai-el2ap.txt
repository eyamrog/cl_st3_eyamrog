A substantial body of evidence indicates that regular engagement in
moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA)—defined as any bodily movement
produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure and is
performed at moderate or vigorous intensities—is associated with a lower
prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the general population,
including individuals in low- and middle-income countries. Furthermore, MVPA is
linked to a reduced risk of developing depression and anxiety
on a global scale. In contrast, high levels of sedentary
behavior (SB), defined as any waking behavior characterized by an
energy expenditure of ≤1.5 metabolic equivalents (METs) while in a
sitting, reclining, or lying posture, are associated with an increased
risk of depressive and anxiety symptoms.
