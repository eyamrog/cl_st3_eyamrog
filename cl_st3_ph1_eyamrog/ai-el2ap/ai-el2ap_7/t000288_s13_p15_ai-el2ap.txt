Dentists are among the professionals with the highest risk of
exposure to COVID-19 due to the oral cavity and clinical
work environment, which present significant potential for the transmission and
acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens. The prevalence of undocumented
infections is a critical factor contributing to the rapid dissemination
of the virus. A considerable proportion of infected individuals are
asymptomatic or exhibit only mild symptoms, yet they constitute a
primary source of transmission in most reported cases, thereby increasing
the risk of infection among healthcare teams and facilitating further
spread within clinical settings.
