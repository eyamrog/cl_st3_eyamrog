Articles were selected through a two-phase process. In the first
phase, two reviewers (VS and DL) independently screened the titles
and abstracts of all references to exclude studies that were
clearly irrelevant. Any discrepancies between the reviewers were resolved by
consultation with a supervisor (FM). In the second phase, the
full texts of the remaining articles were independently assessed by
both reviewers for eligibility. Disagreements at this stage were also
resolved by the supervisor (FM).
