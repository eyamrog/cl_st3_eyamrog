The results demonstrated that the virus is capable of remaining
viable and infectious on surfaces for periods ranging from several
hours to several days, depending on the initial viral load.
These findings underscore the significance of practicing hand hygiene following
contact with inanimate environments and surfaces. This is likely attributable
to the fact that respiratory viruses are expelled in droplets
during coughing and sneezing, and a single droplet may contain
a sufficient quantity of virus to cause infection.
