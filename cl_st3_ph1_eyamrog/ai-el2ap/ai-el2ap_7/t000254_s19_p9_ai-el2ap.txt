Similarly, the annual recruitment of climbers in the < 2.5
cm dbh class was significantly higher than that of plants
in the shrub-tree synusia (Mann-Whitney Test, U = 7.5, p
= 0.0005; Figure 3). In contrast, there was no significant
difference in annual recruitment between climbers and shrubs or trees
in the > 2.5 cm dbh class (Mann-Whitney Test, U
= 45, p = 0.73; Figure 3).
