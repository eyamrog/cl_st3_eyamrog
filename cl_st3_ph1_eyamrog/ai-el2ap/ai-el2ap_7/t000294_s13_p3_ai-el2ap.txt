Hand hygiene is recognized as one of the most effective
and cost-efficient measures for preventing the transmission of infections, as
hands are a primary vehicle for cross-contamination. Numerous studies have
documented inadequate adherence to hand hygiene practices among healthcare professionals
during patient care in health service settings.5,11-13 Evidence indicates that
hand hygiene, specifically through washing with soap and water, significantly
reduces the incidence of preventable infections and consequently decreases morbidity
and mortality in healthcare environments.14-18 Despite its proven effectiveness, compliance
with hand hygiene protocols remains complex and is often influenced
by factors such as human behavior, including misperceptions of risk,
underestimation of personal responsibility, and insufficient knowledge, all of which
can negatively impact adherence to preventive measures.16-18 While the importance
of hand hygiene is widely acknowledged, additional barriers persist, including
infrastructural deficiencies such as the lack of sinks and essential
supplies (e.g., soap, water, paper towels) in public areas with
high human contact—such as escalators, restrooms, buses, and subways—as well
as in communities lacking regular access to water and sewage
systems.
