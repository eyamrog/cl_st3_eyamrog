Plankton samples accounted for the largest number of collections (423),
followed by periphyton (294), benthos (54), and surface sediments (28).
Additional sampling was conducted on soil material, epiphyton, tree trunks,
and epilithon, albeit on a smaller but methodologically appropriate scale.
Notably, the collection of periphytic material contributed approximately 40% of
the total taxa inventoried in the PEFI, taxa that would
have been overlooked if only plankton samples had been collected.
Surface sediment samples from reservoirs also made a significant contribution
to the survey of the PEFI algal flora, particularly with
respect to diatoms and non-pigmented euglenoids.
