Methods: Data were collected from 2,857 blood donors between April
14 and 27, 2020. We report the crude prevalence of
antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the prevalence weighted to reflect the total
state population, and prevalence estimates adjusted for test sensitivity and
specificity. Logistic regression models were employed to identify factors associated
with SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. The analysis incorporated variables including the period
and site of blood collection, sociodemographic characteristics, and place of
residence.
