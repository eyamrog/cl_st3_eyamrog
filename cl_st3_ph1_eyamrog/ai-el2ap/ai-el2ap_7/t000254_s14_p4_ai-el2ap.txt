Data were collected from 10 transects, each measuring 2 ×
50 m (0.1 ha), established in the first half of
2006 (Davison 2009). The permanent transects were randomly distributed along
a 200 m perpendicular line, resulting in a total sampled
area of 1 ha within a conserved section of the
Botanical Institute. This area is undergoing recovery from past disturbances
but has not experienced occupation or land-use change for at
least 65 years (Peccinini & Pivello 2002). The site is
situated at an average altitude of 831 m, on Oxisol
soil, and is located more than 100 m from Cursino
Avenue (District of Água Funda, São Paulo, SP). Within each
transect, all individuals of shrubs, trees, vines, palms, and tree
ferns with a stem diameter at breast height (dbh; measured
at 1.30 m above ground) greater than 2.5 cm were
measured and identified, as were the growing roots of hemiepiphytes
at or below 1.30 m from the soil, following Gentry’s
protocol (1982) and Phillips & Miller (2002). Additionally, in 10
subtransects (1 × 50 m), all plants with a dbh
less than 2.5 cm and a height greater than 1
m were sampled (see Figure 1).
