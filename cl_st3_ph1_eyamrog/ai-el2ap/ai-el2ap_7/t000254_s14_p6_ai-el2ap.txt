Vegetative or fertile branches were collected from shrubs and trees,
when available, for the purposes of herborization and taxonomic identification.
Climbers were not botanically identified to prevent potential negative impacts
on their population dynamics, as the collection of a single
stem could result in the death of the monitored individual
(Sheil 1995a). Consequently, only the overall structure and dynamics of
the climber synusia were assessed, without conducting a floristic analysis
for this group.
