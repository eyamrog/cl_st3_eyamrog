Apple cider vinegar 70% spray was applied twice to all
sample surfaces. A statistically significant reduction in viable cell counts
was observed in biofilms of S. aureus, S. pyogenes, S.
mutans, and E. coli [13]. However, all pacifiers contaminated with
C. parapsilosis and treated with apple cider vinegar remained contaminated
[11].
