In conclusion, factors such as the ease and cost of
doing business, the availability of infrastructural facilities, and other incentives
relevant to attracting investment flows in Turkey require adequate and
sustained attention. This research recommends that the government reduce the
budget deficit, address issues related to improper fiscal management, and
enhance financial discipline through increased accountability and transparency in resource
allocation. Additionally, it is necessary to establish a conducive environment
for foreign direct investment (FDI) by ensuring macroeconomic stability, including
stable interest and inflation rates, which are critical for attracting
foreign investment inflows.
