Climbers represented the most dynamic life form, consistent with findings
by Wright (2004), Phillips et al. (2005), and Laurance et
al. (2014). Penhalber and Mantovani (1997) reported that this synusia
produced the highest number of propagules in the park, potentially
facilitating increased recruitment. However, previous studies have indicated that climbers
exhibit low seedling establishment rates, particularly in more mature forests
(Engel 1998; Schnitzer 2005), which may ultimately limit recruitment into
larger size classes, as observed in the present study. Despite
their lower abundance, climbers experienced the greatest reduction in basal
area, accounting for 36% of the total decrease within the
community, in contrast to the shrub-tree synusia, which exhibited higher
recruitment than basal area loss during the study period. The
observed decline in lianas may be associated with the maturation
of the area. Notably, only the largest lianas (those with
dbh > 2.5 cm) demonstrated higher mortality than recruitment and
showed a declining trend (Î» < 1).
