SARS-CoV-2 is a novel strain of coronavirus first identified in
2019. As it had not previously been isolated in humans,
public health measures to address the pandemic have focused on
eliminating the virus and preventing its rapid transmission between individuals.1-3
Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs primarily through autoinoculation of mucous
membranes (nose, eyes, or mouth) and contact with contaminated inanimate
surfaces. These modes of transmission underscore the importance of promptly
implementing preventive measures to reduce the risk of human infection.5
