The effective implementation of preventive measures against COVID-19 necessitates immediate
and rigorous changes in both individual and collective behavior across
society. In the context of the pandemic, evidence indicates that
the trajectory and impact of COVID-19 in Brazil are contingent
upon the collaborative efforts of government, families, and citizens. The
global situation continues to demand significant attention and can inform
decision-making processes regarding strategies to address this critical period, thereby
enabling interventions that may influence the rapid progression of COVID-19.
