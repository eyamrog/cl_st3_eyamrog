When at least two studies are sufficiently homogeneous with respect
to design, participant characteristics, and outcome measures, we will evaluate
the feasibility of combining their results in a meta-analysis. If
the available studies are heterogeneous or lack sufficient information, their
findings will be summarized using a qualitative synthesis only.
