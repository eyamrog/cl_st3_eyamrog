The aim of this section is not to present every
variation identified among the 70 orthologues (Figure 2), but rather
to highlight specific findings that are particularly relevant to the
discussion and the main conclusion of this study. To facilitate
this, Figure S1 was generated as a simplified representation of
the data shown in Figure 2, displaying only the sites
and species that are discussed in the following paragraphs.
