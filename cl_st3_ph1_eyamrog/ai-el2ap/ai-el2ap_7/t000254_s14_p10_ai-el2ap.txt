Demographic rates were calculated for plants with a diameter at
breast height (dbh) of less than 2.5 cm (and greater
than 1 m in height) as well as for those
with a dbh greater than 2.5 cm. Additionally, three size
classes were defined for the shrub-tree synusia: class I included
individuals with a dbh less than 2.5 cm (and height
greater than 1 m), class II comprised individuals with a
dbh between 2.5 cm and 5 cm, and class III
included individuals with a dbh greater than 5 cm.
