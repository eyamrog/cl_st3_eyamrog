When using a length interval of 28 nucleotides, regions near
positions 3,500 and 11,000 exhibit elevated values. Longer sequences are
excluded from analysis due to the reduced probability of their
occurrence, which results from the increasing number of possible combinations
among the four nucleotide types.
