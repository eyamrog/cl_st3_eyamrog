Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the novel virus
responsible for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), first emerged in China
in December 2019, and the World Health Organization declared a
pandemic on March 11, 2020 (1). Due to its recent
emergence, significant gaps remain in the understanding of this infection.
Key areas of ongoing investigation and debate include the overall
fatality rate, the accuracy of diagnostic tests, and the effectiveness
of current treatment options.
