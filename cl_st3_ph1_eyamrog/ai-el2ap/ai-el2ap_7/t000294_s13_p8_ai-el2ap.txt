A study evaluating the effectiveness of case isolation in controlling
COVID-19 found that isolation alone may be sufficient for outbreak
control over a three-month period, particularly when implemented during periods
of low transmission and prior to the onset of symptoms.21
However, isolation without the implementation of additional preventive measures may
be inadequate for comprehensive outbreak control. Therefore, it is essential
to emphasize the importance of proper hand hygiene, mask usage,
and surface disinfection, as these measures collectively contribute to the
prevention of viral transmission.8,22
