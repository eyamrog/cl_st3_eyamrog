The virus is capable of remaining viable in the air
for extended periods and on non-absorbent surfaces for several hours
or even days. The removal of infectious particles following an
aerosol-generating procedure depends on the type and efficiency of ventilation,
as well as the air changes per hour (ACH) in
the room. It is estimated that a single air change
can eliminate approximately 63% of airborne contaminants. Consequently, a minimum
interval of 20 minutes is recommended before cleaning the environment
after aerosol release.
