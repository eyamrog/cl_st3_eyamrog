The standard operative procedure for performing a tracheostomy in patients
who are either COVID-19 positive or of unknown COVID-19 status
involves strict adherence to infection control protocols to minimize the
risk of viral transmission. All healthcare personnel involved must use
appropriate personal protective equipment, including N95 respirators, face shields, gowns,
and gloves. The procedure should be conducted in a negative
pressure room whenever possible, with the minimum number of essential
staff present. Pre-procedural planning should include clear communication among team
members regarding roles and steps to be followed. Aerosol-generating steps
should be minimized, and the use of closed suction systems
is recommended. Post-procedure, all equipment must be disposed of or
decontaminated according to institutional guidelines, and staff should follow established
protocols for doffing personal protective equipment to further reduce the
risk of contamination.
