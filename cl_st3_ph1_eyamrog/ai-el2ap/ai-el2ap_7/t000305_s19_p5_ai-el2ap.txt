Comparison of group 1 and group 2 shows that the
incidence rate in group 1 is 21.36 times higher than
in group 2. Additionally, the mortality rate in group 1
is 53.21 times higher, and the lethality rate is 2.49
times higher than those observed in group 2. These differences
are likely influenced by the inclusion of the populations of
China and India; when these populations are excluded from the
analysis, the incidence and mortality rate ratios decrease to 7.84
and 23.24, respectively. However, the lethality rate ratio remains consistent
regardless of group composition.
