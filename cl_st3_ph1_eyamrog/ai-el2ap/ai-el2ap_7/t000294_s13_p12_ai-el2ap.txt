When using N95 or PFF2 respirators, it is essential to
ensure that the equipment is properly fitted to the user's
face. The use, handling, and storage of these respirators must
strictly adhere to the manufacturer's instructions, and the equipment must
not be shared among professionals. Prior to use, all components,
including the straps and the material of the nasal bridge,
should be inspected to confirm their integrity and ensure an
adequate seal; respirators that are damp, dirty, torn, dented, or
creased must not be used. Additionally, surgical masks should not
be worn over N95 or equivalent respirators, as this practice
does not enhance filtration or protection against contamination and may
result in unnecessary consumption of additional personal protective equipment (PPE),
which is particularly problematic during periods of supply shortage. In
exceptional circumstances, such as supply shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic,
N95 or equivalent respirators may be reused by the same
professional, provided that appropriate procedures are followed to remove the
mask without self-contamination. To further reduce the risk of contamination,
the use of a face shield over the respirator is
recommended when available. If the respirator remains intact, clean, and
dry, it may be used multiple times within the same
shift by the same professional, for up to 12 hours
or as specified by the Hospital Infection Control Commission (HICC)
of the respective health service.
