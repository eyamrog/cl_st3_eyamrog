In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a high degree of specialization for
infecting humans across diverse populations, functioning as a human-population generalist
coronavirus with respect to its primary cellular entry receptor, ACE2.
Conversely, current evidence does not support the classification of SARS-CoV-2
as a generalist coronavirus capable of naturally and efficiently infecting
a broad range of other species, including domestic animals.
