In the context of daily monitoring and analysis of COVID-19
cases at both state and national levels in Brazil up
to April 18, 2020, comparison of the case growth curve
with those of other countries indicates that Brazil's trajectory differs
from the more severe patterns observed in Italy, Spain, and
the United States (Figure 3, left panel).11-12 Although the initial
phase of the outbreak in Brazil exhibited a similar progression
to these countries, the subsequent divergence in growth rates may
be attributable to increased population adherence to preventive measures and
the implementation of more robust state policies for social restriction.
