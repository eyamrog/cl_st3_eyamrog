Figure 5 summarizes the inter-annual variation of the Trophic State
Index (TSI). The TSI value for 2017 is similar to
that of 1997, both being close to the hypereutrophic threshold.
In contrast, during the 2000–2010 period, TSI values increased and
the hypereutrophic state was predominant. From 2011 onwards, with the
exception of 2013, TSI values decreased to the supereutrophic state.
The most significant change in TSI occurred after phase II
(April 1998–September 1999), with further notable changes associated with specific
events documented in Table 1 and Table 3. The implementation
of secondary sewage treatment at the zoo (STS Zoo, as
indicated in Figure 5) had a marked effect, as evidenced
by a gradual decrease in all measured variables (Table 1).
During the final period analyzed (2014–2017), the lowest values of
TSI, chlorophyll-a, and total phosphorus concentrations were recorded in the
time series.
