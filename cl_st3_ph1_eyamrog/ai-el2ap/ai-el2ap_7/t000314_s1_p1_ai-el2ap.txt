This study presents a technique for detecting regularities in the
complete genome of Coronavirus 2 by utilizing the concept of
intervals within the RNA sequence and comparing these intervals across
the known sequence. The Maximum Regularity Index was employed to
quantify these regularities. The analysis identified regions of high regularity
that correspond to ORF10, Gene N, the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, and
other genomic elements. Notably, intervals around positions 3500 and 11000
exhibited high regularity values, although these regions do not correspond
to well-documented genomic features and are both located within Gene
Orf1ab. These findings suggest that these regions may warrant further
investigation. The detection of such regularities has the potential to
inform the development of biochemical or genetic strategies aimed at
deactivating specific functions of Coronavirus 2 or mitigating its effects.
