The COVID-19 outbreak remains a recent event with an uncertain
duration, necessitating measures to reduce exposure in order to control
or delay the spread of the disease and mitigate associated
negative outcomes, such as increased mortality and deterioration of economic
and social conditions. Evidence from countries that implemented early interventions,
including social distancing and the suspension of classes—such as Singapore,
South Korea, and Japan—indicates that prompt adoption of these strategies,
combined with rigorous case management and widespread diagnostic testing, significantly
influenced transmission dynamics and contributed to lower mortality rates. For
example, as of February 17, 2020, Singapore had the highest
number of confirmed cases outside mainland China; however, the country
rapidly enacted control measures, including isolating all suspected or confirmed
cases in negative-pressure rooms, providing training and re-education for healthcare
professionals on the use of personal protective equipment, utilizing respirators
and air purifiers, monitoring isolation teams for COVID-19 symptoms with
thermal scanners, and investing in single-use equipment such as disposable
bronchoscopes for bronchoscopy and percutaneous tracheostomy. Despite a subsequent increase
in cases, by April 18, Singapore had reported 5,992 confirmed
infections and eleven deaths.
