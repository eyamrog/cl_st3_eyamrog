The first scientific report identifying ACE2 as a host-cell entry
receptor for a coronavirus was conducted with SARS-CoV (Li et
al., 2003). It is currently unknown whether coronaviruses have previously
utilized the ACE2 protein as an entry mechanism in humans
or other species. Given the relatively recent emergence of SARS-CoV
and the long generation time of humans, there has been
insufficient time for significant evolutionary adaptation of the human ACE2
protein in response to these viruses. Consequently, the adaptive changes
observed in the mouse ACE2 receptor in response to MHV,
as described by Peng et al. (2017), are not expected
to be present in human ACE2 with respect to SARS-CoV
or SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the recent evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike
glycoprotein, including the acquisition of a furin cleavage site, combined
with the high degree of conservation of critical ACE2 binding
sites among human populations and various demographic and cultural factors,
has provided SARS-CoV-2 with a substantial advantage in infectivity and
pathogenicity in humans.
