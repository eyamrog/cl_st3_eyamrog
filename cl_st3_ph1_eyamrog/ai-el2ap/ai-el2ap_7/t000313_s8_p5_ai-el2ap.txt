The success of zoonotic spillover, defined as the transmission of
a pathogen from a vertebrate animal to a human, is
a multifactorial process influenced by cultural, ecological, and climatic factors,
as well as specific characteristics of both viruses and hosts
(Olival et al., 2017). A key determinant in this process
is the virus’s ability to recognize and bind to host
cell receptors, which establishes its specificity for particular species, tissues,
or cell types. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the spike
(S) glycoprotein interacts with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors
through its receptor-binding domain (RBD), exhibiting optimized binding affinity (Andersen
et al., 2020; Hoffman et al., 2020; Walls et al.,
2020). Recent studies have identified five amino acid substitutions (L455,
F486, Q493, S494, N501) in the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein that
are associated with natural selection at critical binding sites, contributing
to the virus’s high affinity for human ACE2 (Andersen et
al., 2020; Wan et al., 2020). Additionally, the S glycoprotein
of SARS-CoV-2 contains a furin protease cleavage site at the
S1/S2 subunit junction (Coutard et al., 2020). During infection, host-cell
proteases cleave the S glycoprotein into S1 (containing the RBD)
and S2 subunits, with subsequent exposure of S2 facilitating fusion
of the viral and host-cell membranes (Yan et al., 2020).
Furin proteases, which are abundant in the human respiratory tract,
are considered essential for efficient SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cells
(Lam et al., 2020). In contrast, closely related bat and
pangolin SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses lack the furin cleavage site, which may
represent a barrier to zoonotic transmission. Other human-infecting coronaviruses, such
as HCoV-OC43, MERS-CoV, and HKU1, also possess S1/S2 cleavage sites
that are processed by furin proteases (Coutard et al., 2020).
However, in SARS-CoV, furin-mediated cleavage of the S glycoprotein does
not occur naturally (Simmons et al., 2004), and experimental introduction
of a functional furin cleavage site at the S1/S2 junction
of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein has been shown to significantly
enhance cell-cell fusion (Follis and Nunberg, 2004).
