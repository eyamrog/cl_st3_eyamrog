In Brazil, the Unified Health System (SUS), established in the
1980s to provide universal and comprehensive healthcare, is responsible for
ensuring access to health services for over 210 million Brazilians
as well as numerous foreign residents and visitors. During the
COVID-19 pandemic, SUS has played a critical role in disease
containment by utilizing an extensive network of hospitals, laboratories, research
centers, health units, blood banks and blood product services, affiliated
private institutions, and public universities.
