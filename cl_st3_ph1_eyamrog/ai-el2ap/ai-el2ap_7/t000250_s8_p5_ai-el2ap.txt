To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has
investigated the associations between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary
behavior (SB) with depressive, anxiety, and co-occurring depressive and anxiety
(D&A) symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study aimed
to: (1) assess levels of MVPA and SB during the
COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil; (2) determine the prevalence of depressive,
anxiety, and D&A symptoms in Brazil; (3) examine the associations
between MVPA and SB with depressive, anxiety, and D&A symptoms;
and (4) investigate the associations of different intensities of physical
activity, specifically vigorous physical activity (VPA) and moderate physical activity
(MPA), with depressive, anxiety, and co-occurring D&A symptoms.
