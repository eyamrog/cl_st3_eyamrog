The results indicate that INT does not Granger-cause INF, as
the null hypothesis is accepted at the 5% significance level,
with a probability value of 0.8942. Similarly, INF does not
Granger-cause INT, as evidenced by the acceptance of the null
hypothesis at the 5% significance level, with a probability value
of 0.1264 and an F-statistic of 2.32514. These findings suggest
that there is no causal relationship between INT and INF
in either direction.
