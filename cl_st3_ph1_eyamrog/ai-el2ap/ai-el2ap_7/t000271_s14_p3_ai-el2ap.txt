In Brazil, prospective blood donors are required to complete a
written questionnaire and undergo a brief medical screening prior to
donation. At Hemorio, eligibility is determined according to the criteria
established by the Brazilian Ministry of Health and the American
Association of Blood Banks [18]. Recently, additional criteria related to
COVID-19 have been implemented: individuals are ineligible if they have
experienced flu-like symptoms within the 30 days preceding donation, have
had close contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases in
the same period, or have traveled internationally in the past
30 days. Candidates presenting with a forehead temperature greater than
37.8Â°C on the day of donation are also excluded. As
a result, all individuals accepted for blood donation were asymptomatic
for COVID-19 and had no known epidemiological risk factors for
the disease.
