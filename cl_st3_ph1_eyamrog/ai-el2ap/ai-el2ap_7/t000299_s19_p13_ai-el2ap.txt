Among the seven studies included, five were assessed as having
a low risk of bias [3,8,9,11,13], while two were determined
to have a medium risk of bias [10,15] (Figure 2).
Three studies did not use sterile water as a control
material; these studies also employed more than one disinfection method
in their experimental protocols. Only one study was found to
be free of bias upon analysis [8].
