However, despite this positive trend, Turkey faced various regional and
international challenges beginning in 2008. The 2008 Global Financial Crisis,
widely regarded by economists as the most severe financial crisis
since the Great Depression of the 1930s, had a significant
impact on international trade and financial flows worldwide. Although the
crisis did not originate in developing countries, these economies, including
Turkey, were disproportionately affected, experiencing increased trade and current account
deficits, currency devaluations, rising inflation rates, and growing public budget
deficits. The adverse effects on the Turkish economy were most
evident in the sharp decline in exports and a significant
sudden stop in financial flows (Cömert and Çolak, 2014).
