The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), represents a global public health
emergency. As of May 13, more than 4 million cases
and 280,000 deaths had been reported worldwide. In Brazil, over
160,000 cases and 11,000 deaths had been documented by that
date. To mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the World Health
Organization (WHO) recommended the implementation of physical distancing measures by
national governments. In Brazil, the Ministry of Health’s epidemiological report
number 05 proposed social distancing measures, including self-isolation in areas
with community transmission. Self-isolation is intended to restrict individuals’ movement
within society, thereby reducing interpersonal contact. During self-isolation in Brazil,
there is a recommendation to remain at home, with individuals
advised to leave only for essential activities such as purchasing
food or medicine, or accessing essential services, including medical care.
Although there is a national recommendation to stay at home,
each of Brazil’s 27 federative units retains the authority to
determine and implement more restrictive measures, such as quarantine or
lockdown.
