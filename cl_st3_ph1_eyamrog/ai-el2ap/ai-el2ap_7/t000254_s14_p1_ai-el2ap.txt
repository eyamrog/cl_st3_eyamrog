46°36'48"W and 46°38'00"W longitude, in the city of São Paulo,
São Paulo State, Brazil (Fernandes 2002; CONDEPHAAT 2018). PEFI is
situated on the São Paulo Plateau, which is composed of
crystalline basement rocks and sedimentary formations. The topography is characterized
by rounded hills, with elevations ranging from 760 to 837
meters above sea level. The dominant soil types in the
area are Haplic Cambisols and Red-Yellow Podzolic Latosols (Oxisols) (SMA
