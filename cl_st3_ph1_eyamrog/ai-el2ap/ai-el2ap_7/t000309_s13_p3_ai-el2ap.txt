Previous studies have shown that clinically active inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD) and the use of thiopurines are associated with an
increased risk of viral infections (16,17). However, in contrast to
other viruses such as influenza, herpesvirus, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, norovirus,
and respiratory syncytial virus, current evidence does not indicate that
coronaviruses cause more severe disease in immunosuppressed patients (13,15,17).
