To assess the presence of unit roots in the data
utilized for the empirical analysis, the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test
was applied, and the results are presented in Table 2.
The findings indicate that GD, INF, and INT are stationary
at level, as their respective ADF statistics (4.180454, 3.173179, and
5.591438) exceed the 5% critical values (3.02997, 2.991878, and 3.004861),
suggesting that these variables are integrated of order zero, I(0).
In contrast, FDI and EXC are stationary at first difference,
with ADF statistics (10.14302 and 3.996066) greater than the 5%
critical value (2.998064 for both), indicating integration of order one,
I(1). Given that the variables are integrated at different orders,
subsequent analyses include co-integration testing and estimation of the short-run
speed of adjustment from long-run disequilibrium.
