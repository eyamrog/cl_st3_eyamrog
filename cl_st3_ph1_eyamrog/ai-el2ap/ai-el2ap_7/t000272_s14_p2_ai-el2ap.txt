The plant material was dried at 40 ± 1 °C.
The ethanolic extract (EE) was prepared by percolating the bark
powder with ethanol (Merck, Darmstadt, Hessen, Germany) as the solvent
for five days in three cycles at 30 °C. The
resulting extract was then concentrated using a vacuum rotary evaporator
at 40 °C and 55 rpm until all solvent was
completely removed.
