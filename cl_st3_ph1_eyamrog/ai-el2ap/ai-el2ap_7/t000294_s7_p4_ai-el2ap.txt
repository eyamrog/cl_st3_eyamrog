On February 3, 2020, the Brazilian Ministry of Health declared
a public health emergency of national importance through Ordinance 188,
assigning a level 3 risk classification due to the emergence
of human infection with the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). This measure
was intended to facilitate the implementation of administrative actions with
increased efficiency, enabling the country to prepare for the impending
pandemic, despite the absence of confirmed cases at that time.
The first confirmed case in Brazil was reported by the
Ministry of Health on February 26 in the city of
SÃ£o Paulo, prompting a nationwide state of alert. Preventive measures,
such as hand hygiene and cough etiquette, were reinforced. Nevertheless,
the disease spread rapidly, progressing from imported cases to community
or sustained transmission within less than thirty days. Imported cases
refer to those in which the source of infection can
be traced, typically involving individuals who contracted the virus during
international travel, initially from countries such as China and Italy.
In contrast, community transmission is characterized by the inability to
identify the source of infection, and the presence of asymptomatic
cases, which pose a greater risk due to their potential
to facilitate widespread transmission. In this context of national-level transmission,
mathematical models developed by researchers provided estimates of case progression,
informed by the experiences of countries where the virus had
been introduced prior to its notification in Brazil.
