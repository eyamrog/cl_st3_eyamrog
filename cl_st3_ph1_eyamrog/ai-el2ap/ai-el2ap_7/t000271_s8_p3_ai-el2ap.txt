The infection may present with mild symptoms, typically beginning with
cough, muscle pain, and anosmia, and can progress to high
fever and pneumonia with severe lung involvement [4]; in some
cases, it may result in death [5, 6, 7]. However,
most infections are characterized by few or no symptoms, which
poses a significant challenge for disease control, as asymptomatic individuals
can contribute substantially to transmission [8].
