The novel coronavirus, initially identified in Wuhan, China, in December
2019, subsequently spread globally. In March 2020, the World Health
Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic, prompting heightened healthcare vigilance
worldwide. The resulting health, social, economic, and political measures implemented
to control the spread have had significant impacts on all
countries. Current efforts are directed toward identifying and implementing the
most effective strategies to address the challenges posed by the
pandemic.
