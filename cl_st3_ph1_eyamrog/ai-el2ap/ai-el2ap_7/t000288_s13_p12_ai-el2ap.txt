The third arm of the SOLIDARITY trial evaluates a combination
of two HIV protease inhibitor drugs, lopinavir and ritonavir. This
combination has demonstrated potential activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in
both in vitro and in vivo studies, with its mechanism
of action involving the inhibition of Mpro, an essential enzyme
required for coronavirus replication. However, a recent report published in
The New England Journal of Medicine indicated that the lopinavir-ritonavir
combination did not result in a statistically significant difference in
outcomes compared to the standard care group.
