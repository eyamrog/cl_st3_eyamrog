To remove the mask, first detach the side elastics without
touching the inner surface. After removal, place the mask in
a paper bag or envelope with the elastics positioned outward
to facilitate subsequent handling and reuse. The use of plastic
bags is not recommended, as they may retain moisture and
increase the risk of contamination. It is also important to
note that these masks cannot be cleaned or disinfected for
reuse, and their filtration efficiency decreases when they become wet.
