The three limnological variables used to estimate the Trophic State
Index (TSI)—chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), total phosphorus (TP), and Secchi disk depth
(SD)—exhibited substantial variation throughout the study period (Figure 3). Across
the entire period, TP concentrations ranged from 37.77 to 979.68
µg L⁻¹, with a mean of 172.44 µg L⁻¹; Chl-a
concentrations ranged from 11.77 to 1323.63 µg L⁻¹, with a
mean of 156.60 µg L⁻¹; and SD values ranged from
0.05 to 1.7 m, with a mean of 0.41 m
(Table 1). Chlorophyll-a and total phosphorus concentrations displayed similar temporal
patterns, both showing a rapid increase at the end of
1999. Notably, TP exhibited distinct increases in 1999, 2001, at
the end of 2002, and from 2003 to 2005, after
which both variables maintained similar relative trends. Secchi disk depth
experienced a marked decrease during the winter of 1999 and
remained at relatively low levels until 2010, when values began
to rise again (Figure 3).
