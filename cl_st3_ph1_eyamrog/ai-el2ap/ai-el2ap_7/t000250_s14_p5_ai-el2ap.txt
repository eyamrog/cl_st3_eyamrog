Anxiety symptoms were measured using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI),
a 21-item self-report instrument. Each item assesses a specific anxiety
symptom, and participants rate the extent to which they experienced
each symptom over the past month on a scale from
0 (not at all) to 3 (severely, it bothered me
a lot). Total scores range from 0 to 63, with
established cutoffs indicating minimal or no anxiety symptoms (0–7), mild
anxiety symptoms (8–15), moderate anxiety symptoms (16–25), and severe anxiety
symptoms (26–63). For the purposes of this study, anxiety was
dichotomized as absent (scores 0–7) or prevalent (scores 8–63).
