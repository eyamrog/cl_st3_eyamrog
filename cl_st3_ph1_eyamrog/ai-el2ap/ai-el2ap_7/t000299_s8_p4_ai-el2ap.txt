Given these considerations, the aim of this study was to
conduct a review of pacifier disinfection methods in order to
determine whether a consensus exists in the literature and to
identify whether any method fulfills all expected outcomes. This was
achieved by systematically identifying and evaluating all disinfection methods proposed
in the existing literature.
