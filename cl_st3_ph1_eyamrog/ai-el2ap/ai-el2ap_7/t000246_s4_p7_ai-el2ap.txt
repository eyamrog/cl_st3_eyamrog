The results of this study, along with its methodological design,
may serve as a foundation for future research, thereby addressing
a gap in the existing bibliometric literature in health, particularly
within the field of nursing. This contribution supports efforts to
consolidate the body of knowledge in nursing by promoting research
that facilitates both the expansion and strengthening of this knowledge
base.
