In the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in China,
a cross-sectional study reported that nearly 60% of participants did
not meet the physical activity (PA) recommendations of at least
150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per week, and
identified an association between higher PA levels and reduced negative
affect. Consistent with these findings, our results indicate that engaging
in more than 30 minutes of daily MVPA is associated
with lower prevalence of co-occurring depressive and anxiety symptoms. Additionally,
our study found that performing at least 15 minutes of
vigorous physical activity (VPA) per day was associated with a
reduced prevalence of depressive, anxiety, and co-occurring depressive and anxiety
symptoms. We also observed a linear association between VPA and
the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms, suggesting a dose-response
relationship. However, no linear associations were observed between moderate physical
activity (MPA) or MVPA and depressive or anxiety symptoms after
adjusting for covariates. One possible explanation is that, during the
pandemic, time spent in MPA may have been largely attributable
to household activities, as most household tasks fall within this
intensity range. In contrast, VPA may more accurately represent leisure-time
physical activity. Previous evidence suggests that leisure-time PA is more
strongly associated with positive mental health outcomes than household activities,
and individuals who spend extended periods engaged in household activities
may not experience the same mental health benefits.
