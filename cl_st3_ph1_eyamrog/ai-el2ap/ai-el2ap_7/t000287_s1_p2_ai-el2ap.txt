At the Centro de Terapia Oncológica (CTO), an oncology clinic
in Petrópolis, RJ, Brazil, all healthcare workers (HCWs) were screened
for SARS-CoV-2 to identify and isolate individuals who were either
asymptomatic or symptomatic and tested positive for the virus. Screening
was conducted using IgM/IgG rapid antibody tests for all HCWs,
and those presenting symptoms additionally underwent nasopharyngeal swab collection for
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, in conjunction with
the antibody testing.
