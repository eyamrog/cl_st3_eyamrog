ACE2 is a cell-surface non-raft protein with minimal intracellular localization;
upon binding to coronaviruses, ACE2 undergoes internalization, leading to a
reduction of its activity at the cell surface (Hamming et
al., 2007). The attachment of SARS-CoV-like viruses to ACE2 initiates
a series of molecular signaling events that facilitate viral entry
into the host cell (Simmons et al., 2013), indicating an
effective mechanism for viral infection. Furthermore, Kuba et al. (2005)
demonstrated that SARS-CoV-mediated downregulation of ACE2 contributes to acute lung
injury, which is a major clinical manifestation of human respiratory
diseases caused by coronaviruses.
