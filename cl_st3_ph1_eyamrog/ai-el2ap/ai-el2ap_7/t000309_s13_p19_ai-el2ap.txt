Currently, there are no formal evidence-based recommendations from clinical societies
or governmental bodies specifically addressing immunosuppressed patients, such as those
with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Table 3 presents therapy-specific considerations
for IBD patients, which are primarily based on expert opinion
and should be interpreted within the context of individual patient
circumstances. These recommendations are subject to modification and revision as
new evidence becomes available (14,20).
