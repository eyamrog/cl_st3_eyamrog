The clinical presentation, severity, and prognosis of co-infection with SARS-CoV-2
and an arboviral infection have not yet been well established.
However, existing evidence indicates that a syndemic scenario would pose
additional challenges and burdens for the healthcare and economic systems
of countries endemic for arboviral diseases. Identifying reliable evidence to
inform the development of effective interventions against COVID-19 in this
context is therefore an important and urgent strategic objective. Accordingly,
this rapid living review will systematically assess the best available
evidence to address this scenario and provide reliable information for
decision-makers.
