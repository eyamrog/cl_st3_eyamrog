Table 2 presents the empirical results of the Johansen co-integration
analysis. The Johansen test is designed to determine whether a
long-run relationship exists among the series by testing the null
hypothesis of no co-integrating relationship against the alternative hypothesis that
at least one co-integrating equation is present. Given that the
model includes five variables, the analysis assesses whether the number
of co-integrating equations is zero, one, two, three, four, or
five.
