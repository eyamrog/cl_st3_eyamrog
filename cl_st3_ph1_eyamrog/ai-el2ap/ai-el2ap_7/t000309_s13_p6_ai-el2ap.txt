The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) and Crohn’s and Colitis
UK jointly issued specific guidance for patients with inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD), stratifying risk based on medication use, age, and
additional risk factors. Using a decision tree, patients are categorized
as being at highest, moderate, or lowest risk for serious
complications from COVID-19. The highest risk group includes individuals with
comorbidities such as respiratory or cardiac disease, hypertension, or diabetes
mellitus; those over 70 years of age receiving any form
of immunosuppressive therapy for IBD; patients of any age receiving
≥20 mg prednisolone; those undergoing new induction therapy with biologics
and immunomodulators (combination therapy) within the previous six weeks; individuals
with moderate to severe active disease or short gut syndrome;
and patients requiring parenteral nutrition. Patients treated with biological therapy,
thiopurines, calcineurin inhibitors, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, or combination therapy
are classified as moderate risk, while all other IBD patients
are considered at lowest risk. The guidance recommends that patients
at highest risk should self-isolate, those at moderate risk should
adhere to strict social distancing, and those at lowest risk
should follow general population social distancing measures.
