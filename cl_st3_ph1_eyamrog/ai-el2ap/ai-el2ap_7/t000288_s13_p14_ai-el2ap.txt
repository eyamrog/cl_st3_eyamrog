Clinical trials are currently underway to assess the efficacy of
SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma, obtained from individuals who have recovered from
COVID-19 and may possess relevant antibodies, for the treatment of
patients with severe viral infections. In one study led by
Lei Liu, convalescent plasma (total dose: 400 mL with a
SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody titer greater than 1:1,000) was administered to
five critically ill patients, all of whom exhibited symptom improvement
within ten days. Although these findings, as reported by Shen
et al., are noteworthy, the study has several limitations. The
intervention was not evaluated in a randomized clinical trial, and
there was no comparison with a control group of patients
who did not receive convalescent plasma. Additionally, the patients received
multiple other treatments, including antiviral agents and steroids, and the
plasma was administered up to 21 days after symptom onset,
leaving uncertainty regarding the optimal timing of administration and whether
earlier intervention might have produced different outcomes. Despite these limitations,
the study provides preliminary evidence that supports further investigation of
convalescent plasma therapy in more rigorously designed clinical trials.
