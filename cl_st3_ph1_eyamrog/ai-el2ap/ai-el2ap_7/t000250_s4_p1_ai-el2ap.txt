Individuals who engage in higher levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity
(MVPA) and vigorous physical activity (VPA) are less likely to
exhibit symptoms of depression, anxiety, and distress and anxiety (D&A)
during periods of self-isolation. Conversely, individuals reporting higher levels of
sedentary behavior (SB) are more likely to experience prevalent depressive
symptoms. Population-level strategies aimed at increasing MVPA and VPA while
reducing SB may be important for mitigating the mental health
burden associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health recommendations should
clearly communicate safe exercise practices to the general population.
