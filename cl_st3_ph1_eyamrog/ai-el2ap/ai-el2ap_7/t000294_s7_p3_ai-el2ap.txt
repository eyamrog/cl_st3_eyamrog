In this context, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19
a pandemic on March 11, 2020, and implemented essential preventive
measures. These measures included hand washing with soap and water
whenever possible, and the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer when
soap and water were unavailable. The WHO also recommended avoiding
touching the eyes, nose, and mouth, and advised individuals to
protect others when sneezing or coughing by practicing proper cough
etiquette, such as using a flexed elbow or a disposable
tissue. Furthermore, the WHO advised maintaining a minimum distance of
one meter from others, avoiding crowded places, and wearing a
mask in cases of flu-like symptoms, confirmed COVID-19 infection, or
when providing care to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients.
