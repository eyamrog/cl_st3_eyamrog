In recent years, this component of the SUS has experienced
the most significant weakening, as evidenced by the withdrawal of
Cuban doctors who provided services in highly vulnerable areas of
Brazil, the discontinuation of the multi-professional model in Family Health
Care following the elimination of financial incentives for the Center
for Support to Family Health (NASF), modifications in primary health
care (PHC) financing and organization resulting from the implementation of
the new National Policy for Primary Health Care in 2017,
and alterations in the structure and execution of primary health
incentive programs, such as the Quality and Care Improvement Program
(PMAQ).
