Based on the data obtained from the linearity curves of
each sample, the concentration of each extract required to induce
50% hemolysis of red blood cells (IC50) was determined. These
IC50 values were subsequently used to calculate the selectivity index
(SI) for each extract against the tested bacteria, following the
methodology described by Protopopova et al. (2005). The selectivity index
was calculated using the equation SI = IC50 / MIC,
where SI represents the selectivity index, IC50 is the concentration
of extract causing 50% hemolysis, and MIC is the minimum
inhibitory concentration against the test microorganism.
