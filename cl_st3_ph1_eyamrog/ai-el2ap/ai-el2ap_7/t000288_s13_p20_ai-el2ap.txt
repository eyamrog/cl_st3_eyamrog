In the United Kingdom, the National Health Service (NHS) is
collaborating with dental practices and community dental services to establish
a Local Dental Urgent Care System in each region. These
facilities are designed to accommodate all patient groups, including individuals
with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, those who are shielded or
considered vulnerable, as well as patients without these specific conditions.
Dental public health practitioners will be present at these sites
and will have access to FFP3 respirators to safely perform
dental treatments.
