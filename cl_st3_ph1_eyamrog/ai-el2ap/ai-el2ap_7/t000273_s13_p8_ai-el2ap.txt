Established in 2011 by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, the
Telehealth program (Programa Telessa√∫de, in Portuguese) has served as an
additional resource for health professionals and managers in addressing the
challenges posed by COVID-19. Utilizing bidirectional telecommunication tools, health professionals
and managers can submit inquiries regarding clinical management, preventive measures,
or work process issues, to which a qualified professional responds
with information grounded in current scientific evidence. This approach has
contributed to improving the quality of care provided in primary
health care (PHC) and reducing unnecessary referrals to specialized services.
