Currently, there is no consensus regarding pacifier disinfection protocols, as
various agents and strategies have been proposed in the literature.
Each method offers specific advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, it is
important to assess the most appropriate disinfection method based on
factors such as the frequency of pacifier use, the location
where the pacifier was dropped, and the family's access to
disinfectant agents.
