Although other exotic species have been reported in fragments of
the park (SMA 2008; Petri et al. 2018), only Coffea
arabica L. (coffee) was recorded in the sampling units recruited
in 2012 (Table 2). The occurrence of this species is
associated with the historical land use of the park area,
where coffee was previously cultivated on small farms prior to
the establishment of the park (SMA 2008). Coffea arabica is
dispersed by animals and is capable of developing in shaded
environments, such as the understory examined in this study (Instituto
HÃ³rus 2019). Currently, this species is classified as a Non-Dominant
Invader in the study area (Petri et al. 2018) and
is considered to have intermediate priority for removal from protected
areas (Durigan et al. 2013). Ongoing monitoring of the park
fragments is therefore necessary to inform appropriate management strategies for
this species.
