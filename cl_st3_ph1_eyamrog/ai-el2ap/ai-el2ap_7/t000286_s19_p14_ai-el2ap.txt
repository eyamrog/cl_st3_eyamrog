The results indicate that inflation (INF) does not Granger-cause foreign
direct investment (FDI), as the null hypothesis is accepted at
the 5% significance level, with a probability value of 0.8324.
Similarly, FDI does not Granger-cause INF, as evidenced by the
acceptance of the null hypothesis at the 5% significance level,
with a probability value of 0.7724 and an F-statistic of
0.26197. These findings suggest that there is no causal relationship
between INF and FDI in either direction.
