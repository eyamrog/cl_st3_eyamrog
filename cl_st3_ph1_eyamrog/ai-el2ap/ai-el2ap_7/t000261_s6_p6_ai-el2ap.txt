In 2011, the Trophic State Index (TSI) first reached the
supereutrophic state (Figures 2c, 5a), which was attributed to prior
management actions and the temporary diversion of sewage effluent from
the São Paulo State Department of Agriculture (Table 3). The
marked increase in TSI observed in 2013 corresponded to the
severe drought that occurred in southeastern Brazil during 2013–2014 (ANA
2015). In 2014, the discharge of sewage effluent was permanently
discontinued; despite the system remaining in a supereutrophic state, all
measured variables indicated an improvement in ecosystem health (Table 1).
