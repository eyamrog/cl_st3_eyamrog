Shrub and tree individuals sampled in 2006, as well as
those recruited during the study period, were identified through comparison
with herbarium specimens, consultation of relevant literature, and verification with
researchers from the Herbarium of the São Paulo Botanical Institute
(SP) and the São Paulo Forestry Institute (SPSF). Botanical nomenclature
followed the Brazilian Flora Species List (Flora do Brasil 2020
under construction 2019), in accordance with the APG IV system
(APG IV 2016). Voucher specimens have been deposited in the
Herbarium of the São Paulo Botanical Institute (SP, Maria Eneyda,
P. K. Fidalgo).
