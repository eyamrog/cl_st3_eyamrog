The changepoint analysis identified a single point that divided the
TSI time series into two segments, as indicated by the
orange lines in Figure 4a. These segments correspond to significant
changes in both the mean and variance of TSI values
over time. Subsequently, a new changepoint was identified within each
segment to assess additional mean changes in the data. The
analysis revealed an initial mean increase (from 64 to 71,
Figure 4a), followed by a mean decrease (from 74 to
67, Figure 4b), and ultimately a stable mean value (67,
Figure 4c). This information informed the application of piecewise regression.
The first mean change occurred in August 1999, and this
point was considered as a potential breakpoint in the segmented
regression analysis. However, the breakpoint identified by the regression occurred
in October 2001. These results indicate a significant increase in
TSI followed by a significant decrease (Figure 4b), as evidenced
by a positive regression coefficient for Time (0.29) and a
negative coefficient for U1.Time (−0.34) (Table 2). The P value
for the U1.Time term is reported as “not applicable (NA)”
in Table 2 because standard methods are not suitable in
this context, as previously discussed. The Davies test was significant,
supporting the validity of the estimated regression coefficients.
