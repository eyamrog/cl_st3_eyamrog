Health professionals are encountering new challenges in delivering patient care,
particularly with the increasing use of remote treatment modalities such
as chat, video consultations, telemedicine, and teledentistry. These technologies are
prompting a reassessment of the professional-patient relationship, as their integration
into daily practice remains limited among most dentists. It is
projected that by 2025, over 60% of the global population
will have access to mobile internet. Consequently, mobile technologies, including
smartphones, have significant potential to support community health, even among
low- and middle-income populations. Furthermore, individuals without direct access to
mobile services may also experience indirect benefits, such as reduced
waiting times at local health facilities, including Primary Health Units.
