Quantitative analysis of the phytochemical extract and fractions of S.
brasiliensis Engl. revealed a high concentration of polyphenols. Based on
these findings, gallic acid was selected as a marker compound
for further quantification. In all samples analyzed, gallic acid was
the predominant component, exhibiting a retention time of approximately 3.0
minutes (Figure 1).
