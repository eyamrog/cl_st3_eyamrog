Reliable laboratory diagnosis is a key priority for supporting effective
public health interventions. In cases of acute respiratory infections, reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is routinely employed to detect
viral pathogens present in respiratory secretions. During international health emergencies,
the effectiveness of real-time virus detection using RT-PCR has been
demonstrated through coordinated efforts between public laboratories and academic institutions.
