Most surgical societies worldwide recommend postponing all elective surgeries and
endoscopic procedures to protect both patients and healthcare personnel, as
well as to conserve critical resources such as hospital beds
and personal protective equipment (PPE) (32,33). There is concern regarding
the potential aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2 during minimally invasive procedures, although
current evidence remains limited. Similar risks may be associated with
the use of electrocautery in open surgery. It is advisable
to adhere strictly to PPE protocols in accordance with local
guidelines, including the use of N95 masks and face shields.
When available, negative pressure operating rooms should be utilized, and
for laparoscopic procedures, the implementation of smoke evacuation systems is
recommended. Furthermore, only essential personnel should be present during surgical
procedures.
