For procedures involving patients with suspected or confirmed infection with
the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that may generate aerosols—such as those
that induce coughing, intubation or tracheal aspiration, invasive and non-invasive
ventilation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, manual ventilation prior to intubation, sputum induction,
and nasotracheal sample collection—healthcare professionals are required to use respiratory
protection masks (particulate respirators) with a minimum filtration efficiency of
95% for particles up to 0.3 µm (e.g., N95, N99,
N100, PFF2, or PFF3).8,23 Whenever possible, aerosol-generating procedures should be
conducted in a respiratory isolation unit equipped with negative pressure
and a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. In settings where
such units are unavailable, patients should be managed in rooms
with closed doors and open windows, and the number of
healthcare professionals present during these procedures should be minimized.23
