The VECM results indicate that the error correction term (ECM)
at lag 1 is negative, consistent with the expectation that
the ECM corrects deviations from the long-run equilibrium relationship between
POV and the explanatory variables. The coefficient of the ECM
suggests an adjustment speed of 1.99% per annum, meaning that
1.99% of any short-run disequilibrium is corrected within one year.
The model's RÂ² value is 0.35, indicating that approximately 35%
of the total variation in FDI is explained by the
independent variables (GD, INF, INT, and EXC) over the study
period, while the remaining 65% is attributable to factors not
included in the model.
