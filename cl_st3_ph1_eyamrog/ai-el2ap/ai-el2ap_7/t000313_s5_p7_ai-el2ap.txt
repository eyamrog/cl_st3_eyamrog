It is well established that, following cell entry, pathogens can
be inhibited by neutralizing host antibodies, a process observed in
SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans (Conti et al., 2020). According to
the World Health Organization, the majority of individuals infected with
SARS-CoV-2 experience mild or no symptoms, despite possessing identical amino
acids at the ACE2 binding sites as reported in this
study. The mechanisms by which antibodies neutralize coronavirus infections have
been previously described (Hofmann et al., 2004; Reguera et al.,
2012; Li et al., 2020a), demonstrating that an effective innate
immune response—such as that typically found in younger individuals or
those who do not develop an excessive immunological reaction—serves as
the primary defense against opportunistic coronaviruses. Additionally, genetic variability in
other systems may contribute to the observed heterogeneity in COVID-19
symptoms and outcomes and cannot be excluded as a factor.
It is also important to note that the ACE2 gene
contains numerous polymorphisms outside the regions encoding key binding sites,
as discussed in the results section. Therefore, it is possible
that some of these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may influence
differential susceptibility to infection, as well as the variability in
symptoms and outcomes observed among human populations.
