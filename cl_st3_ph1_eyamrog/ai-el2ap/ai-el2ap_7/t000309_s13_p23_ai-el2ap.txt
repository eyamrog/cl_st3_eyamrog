The emergence of the novel coronavirus has introduced significant challenges
for surgeons globally. Although numerous patients require surgical intervention, there
are substantial concerns regarding the increased risk of severe pulmonary
infection and extended hospitalization. These risks are especially pronounced in
patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), who are often immunosuppressed
due to both the underlying pathology and the immunomodulatory therapies
commonly employed, as well as potential nutritional deficiencies. In this
context, surgical procedures may further contribute to patient morbidity.
