Freshwater systems are among the most threatened ecosystems globally, despite
their importance as essential natural resources (Dudgeon et al. 2006;
Vörösmarty et al. 2010; Moss 2010). Eutrophication, driven by anthropogenic
activities, is a prevalent issue that negatively affects the multiple
uses of water, the maintenance of aquatic biodiversity, and human
health (Davidson & Jeppesen 2013; Cumming et al. 2015).
