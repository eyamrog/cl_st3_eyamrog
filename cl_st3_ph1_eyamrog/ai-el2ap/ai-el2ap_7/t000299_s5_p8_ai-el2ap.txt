Another commonly employed strategy for pacifier decontamination by parents is
vigorous cleaning using only sterile water. However, evidence indicates that
this method is insufficient for eliminating total pacifier contamination, including
contamination by planktonic cells, as reported in several studies [3,8â€“11].
These findings confirm that sterile water alone is not effective
in removing bacterial and fungal contamination from pacifiers [4,7]. Consequently,
water can serve as a control in in vitro tests
designed to assess the efficacy of various physical and chemical
disinfection protocols prior to conducting in vivo evaluations [3].
