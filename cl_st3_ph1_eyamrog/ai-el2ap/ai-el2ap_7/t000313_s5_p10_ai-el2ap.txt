As additional in vitro and in vivo functional studies are
conducted, it will become possible to determine the minimum amino
acid combination in the ACE2 binding sites and other critical
regions of the receptor that is essential for effective interaction
with the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Until such data are available,
current predictions remain speculative; however, they may inform future research
and the development of strategies to mitigate infection and its
associated consequences. In this context, we propose that relatively few
ACE2 orthologues exhibit tropism for SARS-CoV-2, likely due to the
virusâ€™s adaptation, through natural selection, to utilize Homo sapiens ACE2
as an efficient entry receptor. To date, only one preliminary
in vivo study has assessed animal susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 (Shi
et al., 2020). In this study, ferrets, cats, dogs, pigs,
chickens, and ducks were intranasally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 and euthanized
several days post-inoculation. The results indicated that ferrets and cats
are highly susceptible to infection, dogs exhibit low susceptibility, and
livestock species such as pigs, chickens, and ducks are not
susceptible. However, there are currently no scientific reports of natural
SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals residing in anthropogenic environments, with the
exception of isolated press reports describing infections in cats and
in tigers and lions at the Bronx Zoo in New
York City. This observation challenges earlier predictions that SARS-CoV-2 would
infect a broad range of species (Luan et al., 2020;
Wan et al., 2020). Furthermore, the lack of a veterinary
epidemiological emergency among companion animals during the ongoing human COVID-19
pandemic also calls into question the preliminary findings of Shi
et al. (2020), which suggested high susceptibility of cats to
SARS-CoV-2. If such susceptibility exists in these and other animals,
it appears to be considerably more limited than that observed
in humans.
