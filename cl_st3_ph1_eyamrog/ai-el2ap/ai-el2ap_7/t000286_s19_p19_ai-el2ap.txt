The results indicate that EXC does not Granger-cause GD, as
the null hypothesis cannot be rejected at the 5% significance
level, with a probability value of 0.0124. Similarly, the analysis
shows that GD does not Granger-cause EXC, as the null
hypothesis is also accepted at the 5% significance level, with
a probability value of 0.0709, which is further supported by
the F-statistic value of 5.66235. These findings suggest the absence
of Granger causality in either direction between EXC and GD.
