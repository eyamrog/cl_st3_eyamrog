As of April 30, 2020, no oncological patient at CTO
had been officially diagnosed with COVID-19. The implementation of mass
testing among healthcare workers may have contributed to reducing asymptomatic
SARS-CoV-2 transmission and maintaining the health of patients receiving services
at the facility.
