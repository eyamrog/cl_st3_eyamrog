During the analysis, Gene S, Gene N, and ORF10 were
identified. The regions around positions 3,500 and 11,000, respectively, exhibited
high levels of regularity; however, these regions do not correspond
to any previously documented elements within the Orf1ab gene. Further
investigation of these regions may be warranted to determine their
potential significance.
