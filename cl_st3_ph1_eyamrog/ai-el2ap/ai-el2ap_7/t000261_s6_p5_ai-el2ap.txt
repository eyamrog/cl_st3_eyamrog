Water transparency was among the variables most affected by water
hyacinth removal (Bicudo et al. 2007) and exhibited significant changes
throughout the time series, providing valuable information regarding system equilibrium
(Scheffer 1990). Observations indicate that the previously persistent turbid phase
may have begun to reverse starting in 2011, with more
pronounced improvements in transparency recorded between 2013 and 2017 (Figures
2â€“3). As noted by Crossetti et al. (2019), the replacement
of dense cyanobacterial blooms by other phytoplankton species, such as
the invasive Ceratium furcoides, likely contributed to the observed increases
in water transparency.
