The fourth arm of the SOLIDARITY trial evaluates the combination
of lopinavir-ritonavir with interferon-beta. Interferon-beta is expected to enhance the
innate antiviral response, which may be beneficial during the early
stages of infection. However, caution is warranted, as there remains
a possibility that interferon-beta could exacerbate inflammation during the later
phases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
