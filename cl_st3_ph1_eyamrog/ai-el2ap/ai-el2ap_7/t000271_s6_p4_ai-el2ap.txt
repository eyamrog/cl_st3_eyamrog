The results of this study suggest that achieving an effective
level of herd immunity in the short term is unlikely.
Consequently, relaxing social distancing measures in the near future may
not be advisable and should be approached with caution, taking
into account the capacity of hospital infrastructure, particularly the availability
of ICU beds and ventilators necessary for the treatment of
severe COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, it remains uncertain whether the antibody
response confers sufficient neutralizing activity to prevent reinfection [24]. If
only a subset of individuals with antibodies possess neutralizing antibodies,
the threshold required for herd immunity would need to be
adjusted upward. Under these circumstances, it is probable that the
desired level of herd immunity will not be attained prior
to the development and distribution of an effective vaccine.
