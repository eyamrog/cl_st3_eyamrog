Another important factor related to local conditions and resources that
warrants further research is climate, particularly in connection with the
effects of urbanization and the formation of urban heat islands
(Marengo 2007, Dias et al. 2013). Ecological studies have demonstrated
a positive association between increased mortality rates of trees and
lianas and the occurrence of climate extremes (Hubbell & Foster
1992, Condit et al. 1996a,b, Curran et al. 1999, Nepstad
et al. 2007, Feeley et al. 2011). Rainfall data collected
in the park over an 85-year period (1933â€“2018) indicate significant
short-term variability, including the driest month (July 2008), the wettest
month, and the second wettest year (January 2010) within the
entire historical record (EM-IAG 2017). Although lianas generally exhibit a
competitive advantage (Schnitzer 2005) and smaller individuals are increasing in
abundance (Laurance et al. 2014), their successful transition to larger
size classes and overall persistence depend on the availability of
well-developed phorophytes (Phillips et al. 2005, Sfair et al. 2013,
Nogueira et al. 2014). In the study area, tree populations
are characterized by small individuals with slow growth rates, and
larger trees (>2.5 cm diameter) exhibit higher mortality than recruitment,
which poses a challenge for maintaining the abundance and basal
area of larger lianas (Nogueira et al. 2014).
