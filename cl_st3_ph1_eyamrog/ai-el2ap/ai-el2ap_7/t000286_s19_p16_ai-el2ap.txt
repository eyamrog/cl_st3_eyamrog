The results indicate that exchange rate (EXC) does not Granger-cause
foreign direct investment (FDI), as the null hypothesis is accepted
at the 5% significance level, with a probability value of
0.6838. Conversely, FDI is found to Granger-cause EXC, as the
alternative hypothesis is accepted at the 5% significance level, supported
by a probability value of 0.0233 and an F-statistic of
4.66525. These findings suggest a unidirectional causality from FDI to
EXC.
