The coronavirus infection, also known as SARS-CoV-2, has demonstrated significant
potential for fatal outcomes and constitutes a major global health
concern. Following its emergence in Wuhan, China, the virus rapidly
spread worldwide, resulting in a pandemic that led to the
collapse of healthcare systems in several countries, with substantial social
impact and high mortality rates, particularly in Italy and Spain.
Comprehensive intra- and extra-hospital measures have been implemented to reduce
the transmission and dissemination of COVID-19. In the context of
surgical practice, a large number of non-essential or elective procedures
have been cancelled or postponed until the pandemic is controlled,
while urgent and oncological surgeries have continued. This publication presents
adaptations using commonly available laparoscopic materials aimed at minimizing the
risk of viral transmission and contamination among healthcare personnel involved
in the surgical care of patients.
