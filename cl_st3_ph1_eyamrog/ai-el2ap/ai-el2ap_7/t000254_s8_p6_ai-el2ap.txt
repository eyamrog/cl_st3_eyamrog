Differentiated dynamics are also anticipated among successional groups within rainforests
(Budowski 1965, Swaine et al. 1987, Whitmore 1989, Gomes et
al. 2003, Schorn & Galv√£o 2009), such as those found
in the PEFI forest, which is characterized by a mosaic
of secondary areas at various successional stages (Nastri 1992, Struffaldi-De-Vuono
1985, Costa & Mantovani 1992, Gomes & Mantovani 2001, Pivello
& Peccinini 2002, Gomes et al. 2003). Accordingly, we also
report the status of successional groups, with the expectation that
early- and late-successional plants will exhibit distinct patterns of mortality
and recruitment.
