The acceleration of eutrophication occurred at the end of 1999
due to self-eutrophication driven by internal phosphorus loading. This period
marks the beginning of the time series analyzed in this
study and encompasses more than 15 years of post-disturbance data.
The availability of this long-term dataset enabled a detailed investigation
of the system's response following the extreme event (Turner et
al. 2006; Muller et al. 2010) and provided a robust
baseline for detecting changes and quantifying ecosystem responses to disturbance
(Buma 2015).
