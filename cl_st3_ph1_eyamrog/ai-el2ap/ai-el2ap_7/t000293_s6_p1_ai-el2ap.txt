The results of this study indicate that chest CT demonstrates
good diagnostic performance for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients at
a cancer center. Chest CT scans were classified based on
previously established criteria for interpreting imaging in patients with suspected
COVID-19. Two interpretative scenarios were evaluated: in the first scenario,
only chest CT scans with typical findings were considered positive
for COVID-19, while in the second scenario, scans with indeterminate
findings were also classified as positive. These findings may be
particularly relevant in triage situations where CT imaging is available
but access to RT-PCR testing is limited, results are delayed,
or there is a shortage of hospital beds and isolation
units. The first scenario yielded high specificity, supporting the use
of positive CT results to identify patients who may benefit
from further investigation or intervention, as the likelihood of false
positives is low. The second scenario demonstrated high sensitivity, supporting
the use of negative CT results to identify patients in
whom additional diagnostic or therapeutic measures, such as RT-PCR testing,
isolation, or hospitalization, may be unnecessary or can be optimized,
given the low rate of false negatives.
