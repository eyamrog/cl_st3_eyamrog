Materials and Methods: A literature search was performed in the
MEDLINE/PubMed, Scielo, Lilacs, Web of Science, and Scopus databases to
identify all relevant articles published in the past 20 years,
following PRISMA guidelines. Two reviewers independently extracted data using a
standardized form. The extracted variables included country of study, study
design, pacifier material, sample size, microorganisms analyzed, decontamination methods employed,
accessibility of the methods, and reported results.
