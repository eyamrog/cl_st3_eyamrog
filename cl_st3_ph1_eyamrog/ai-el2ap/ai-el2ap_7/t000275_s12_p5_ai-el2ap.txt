Practical measures: After inserting the trocars, connect the remaining cable
tip from connection A to one of the trocars that
does not contain the insufflator (Figure 2B). Next, use the
second cable by attaching one end to the water seal
orifice B and the other end to a slow-flow continuous
suction device (Figure 3). Once the entire system is properly
assembled, open the valve of the selected trocar.
