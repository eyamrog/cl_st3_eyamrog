In many regions of Brazil distant from major urban centers,
the aprons provided by healthcare institutions are made of fabric
rather than being disposable. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is
essential that these fabric aprons are sent immediately to the
laundry after each use, and their reuse for subsequent patient
appointments is not recommended. Reusing aprons may increase the risk
of contamination and transmission, potentially leading to a higher demand
for hospital beds for severe cases and the removal of
healthcare professionals due to infection. Regarding the use of procedure
gloves, they should be discarded before healthcare workers exit the
isolation room of patients. Additionally, long-cuffed rubber gloves should be
used by support staff, such as cleaning personnel. It is
critical for all professionals to recognize that glove use does
not replace hand hygiene, and that surfaces in the vicinity
of patients, including tables and bedside rails, should be considered
contaminated regardless of patient infection status. These surfaces should not
be touched with gloves to prevent environmental spread of the
virus. Improper glove use, particularly in isolation areas with multiple
COVID-19 patients, may result in cross-contamination and increased morbidity.
