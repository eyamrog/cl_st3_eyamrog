This study investigates the impact of selected macroeconomic variables on
investment inflows in Turkey. According to the macroeconomic theory of
foreign direct investment, investment inflows are primarily influenced by changes
in the macroeconomic environment. Key components of this environment include
government deficits, exchange rates, inflation rates, and interest rates, all
of which are factors that can affect the volume of
investment entering a country.
