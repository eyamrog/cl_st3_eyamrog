Sixteen algal classes have been recorded in the PEFI area,
with a total of 869 taxa identified to date, including
species, varieties, and taxonomic forms. It is estimated that approximately
95% of all taxa present in the PEFI area have
already been inventoried. Chlorophyceae represent the most species-rich group. The
addition of Radiococcaceae is expected to contribute minimally to the
overall taxon count. Zygnematophyceae are the second most diverse class,
with 167 taxa, and their survey in the PEFI area
is considered complete. Bacillariophyceae rank third, with 115 taxa currently
recorded; however, this figure likely underestimates the true diversity of
this group within the Park. While Chlorophyceae comprise a large
number of genera, only a few genera contain a high
number of species. In contrast, Zygnematophyceae include fewer genera, but
two genera—Cosmarium and Staurastrum—are particularly species-rich, substantially increasing the total
number of taxa for this class. Bacillariophyceae are recognized globally
as one of the most species-rich algal groups, and it
is anticipated that additional taxa remain to be surveyed in
the PEFI area.
