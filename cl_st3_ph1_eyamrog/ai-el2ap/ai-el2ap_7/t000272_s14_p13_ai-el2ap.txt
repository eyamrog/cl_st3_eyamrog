Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) were conducted
using a DTG-60 instrument (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). Approximately 7.0
mg of each sample was placed in an alumina crucible
and heated from 25 °C to 900 °C at a
rate of 10 °C/min under a nitrogen atmosphere, following the
procedure described by Sette-de-Souza et al. (2018).
