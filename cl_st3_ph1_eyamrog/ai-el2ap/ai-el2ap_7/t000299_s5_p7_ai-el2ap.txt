Considering the variability observed in the analyses, it is necessary
to evaluate disinfection methods that demonstrate clear advantages and can
be easily adopted by the general population. In this context,
the use of antimicrobial sprays in daily routines appears to
be a practical and convenient alternative [13]. Among the seven
articles reviewed, five investigated the disinfection efficiency of this method.
The primary advantage of spray application is its rapid and
straightforward use, as well as the provision of a fresh,
uncontaminated portion of the solution with each application. In contrast,
the dipping process is associated with rapid contamination of the
solution, necessitating frequent replacement [23]. Additionally, the effectiveness of disinfection
is dependent on the specific agent employed, and there is
currently no consensus regarding the most effective agent for use
in sprays.
