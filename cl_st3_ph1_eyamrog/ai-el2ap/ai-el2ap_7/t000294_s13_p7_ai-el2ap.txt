Social distancing is a key strategy implemented by institutions to
reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. By limiting contact between potentially
infected and uninfected individuals, or between groups with differing transmission
rates, social distancing aims to delay the epidemic peak and
reduce its overall impact, thereby protecting healthcare system capacity. The
effectiveness of isolation measures is influenced by epidemiological factors such
as the basic reproduction number and the proportion of transmissions
occurring prior to symptom onset. These interventions are warranted due
to the potential for asymptomatic individuals to transmit the virus
before being isolated, which complicates efforts to control the pandemic.
Figure 1 presents the primary public health measures recommended for
early adoption to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.
