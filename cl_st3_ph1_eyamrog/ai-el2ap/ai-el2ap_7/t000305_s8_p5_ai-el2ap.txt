Coronavirus infection occurs when the virus enters the human body
through mucous membranes. The host immune response, in terms of
both its nature and magnitude, determines the clinical manifestation of
the disease. After traversing the mucosal barrier, which serves as
a mechanical defense, the innate immune system—comprising macrophages, CD4+ lymphocytes,
and natural killer cells—acts to eliminate the virus and/or present
viral antigens to cells responsible for antibody production, thereby activating
humoral immunity. Effective coordination of these immune responses is necessary
to clear the infection and establish long-term protection. Failure to
control the infection or an excessive immune response can result
in severe outcomes, including death.
