Once individuals are accepted as blood donors and provide informed
consent for both blood donation and additional testing for pathogens
not included in the mandatory list of infectious disease markers
required for all blood donations in Brazil, they are automatically
enrolled in the study. Blood donation and sample collection were
conducted either at the fixed Hemorio central facility or through
mobile collection units located in churches and private condominiums within
the Rio de Janeiro area.
