Position 24, identified as one of three sites with a
high probability of being under positive selection, exhibits eight different
amino acids segregating across taxa (Figures 2 and S1). Li
et al. (2005b) demonstrated that the amino acid substitution from
glutamine to lysine at position 24 (Q24K), in combination with
a lysine to glutamate substitution at position 26 (K26E), slightly
inhibits the interaction with the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. Rattus norvegicus
possesses this combination (24K and 26E), whereas mouse species (Mus
musculus, Mus caroli, and Mus pahari) have asparagine (N) at
position 24. Additionally, Rattus norvegicus ACE2 contains asparagine (N), phenylalanine
(F), and serine (S) at positions 82â€“84, a combination reported
by Li et al. (2005b) to inhibit ACE2 interaction with
the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. Furthermore, the presence of histidine (H)
at position 353 in murine ACE2 may also inhibit or
reduce the efficiency of this interaction, as suggested by Wan
et al. (2020). The present study indicates that murine ACE2
shares only 56% sequence identity with human ACE2 at these
30 binding sites, supporting the hypothesis that murine ACE2 cannot
naturally bind the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein. In contrast, glutamine (Q)
and lysine (K) at positions 24 and 26 are conserved
in humans, all primates, and Cavia porcellus (guinea pig), a
rodent frequently used as an experimental model. However, differences at
other key binding sites result in only 70% identity between
guinea pig and human ACE2 at these 30 binding sites.
