In our outpatient clinic, the majority of appointments were rescheduled.
In the absence of a formal telehealth system, medical staff
monitored patients with severe active disease requiring corticosteroids or combination
therapy through telephone consultations. Currently, laboratory testing is strictly limited,
and the endoscopy unit is attending only to urgent cases
in accordance with guideline recommendations (11). Consequently, when necessary, ileocolonoscopy
was substituted with fecal calprotectin measurement.
