Previous studies reported high sensitivity (97%) and low to moderate
specificity (25â€“56%) for chest CT; however, these studies did not
specify the criteria used to classify chest CT findings as
positive (11,18). In contrast, Bai et al. demonstrated that chest
CT can achieve high specificity and moderate sensitivity in differentiating
COVID-19 from other viral pneumonias (17). These results indicate that
variations in the criteria used to interpret CT findings may
lead to differences in diagnostic accuracy.
