The observed dynamism appears to be related to local conditions
and the availability of environmental resources. The park area has
been under protection since 1893, and land use within the
sampled area has remained unchanged for at least 65 years
(Peccinini & Pivello 2002). Variations in water availability, temperature (Feeley
et al. 2011), light, and mineral nutrients have been correlated
with changes in the dynamics of plant communities (Laurance et
al. 2009; Machado & Oliveira-Filho 2010).
