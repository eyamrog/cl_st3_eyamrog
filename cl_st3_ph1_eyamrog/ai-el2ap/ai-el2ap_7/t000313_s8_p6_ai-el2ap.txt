Alterations in key amino acids (AAs) involved in the interaction
between the SARS-CoV-like S glycoprotein and ACE2 are critical determinants
of cross-species transmission, multi-host infections, and interspecies differences in susceptibility
to infection and disease manifestation. Evolutionary processes may account for
some of these patterns. To enhance understanding of these mechanisms,
we conducted a comparative genomic analysis of 70 ACE2 orthologues
from a diverse set of placental mammal species, including pangolin,
civet, bat, mink, and five New World monkey (Parvorder Platyrrhini)
species. In addition, we examined genetic variation at key ACE2
binding sites across human populations. The primary objective of this
study is to characterize taxon-specific variability in the ACE2 amino
acid sequence and assess its potential impact on cross-species SARS-CoV-2
transmission, host range, and related factors, which are of particular
relevance in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
