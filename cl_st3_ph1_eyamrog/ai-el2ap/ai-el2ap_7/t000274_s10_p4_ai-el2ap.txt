Laryngoscopy, tracheal intubation, and bronchoscopy are associated with aerosol generation
primarily when they induce a cough or are accompanied by
other aerosol-generating procedures, such as aspiration. The likelihood of aerosol
production during these interventions can be reduced by ensuring adequate
neuromuscular blockade and by avoiding the simultaneous performance of multiple
procedures.
