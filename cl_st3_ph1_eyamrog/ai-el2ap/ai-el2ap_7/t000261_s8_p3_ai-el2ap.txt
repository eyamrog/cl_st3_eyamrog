The history of the Garças Reservoir illustrates significant human impacts
resulting from urbanization throughout the twentieth century. The reservoir is
situated within the Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga preservation
area and is surrounded by the São Paulo Metropolitan Region.
It was originally constructed in 1894 as a water supply
reservoir to address the city's increasing demand for drinking water
and served this function until 1928. Costa-Böddeker et al. (2012)
documented the reservoir's eutrophication over approximately 110 years through a
paleolimnological study and analysis of land-use records from 1894 to
2005. Their findings indicate that the reservoir underwent a substantial
decline in water quality, primarily due to the influx of
untreated sewage from the city zoo and additional untreated domestic
effluent from the São Paulo State Department of Agriculture.
