This protocol for a rapid living systematic review and network
meta-analysis (if applicable) was prospectively registered on the PROSPERO International
Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews platform (CRD42020179818) and developed in
accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and
Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. The final report will adhere to
the PRISMA extension statement for reporting systematic reviews that include
network meta-analyses. For the rapid systematic review, we will utilize
abbreviated systematic review methods; specifically, we will not conduct independent
screening of abstracts and will exclude searches of grey literature,
as described in previous methodological guidance.
