Both projects facilitated the acquisition of high-quality equipment for the
Paresi and Enawene Nawe communities through financial support from ELDP/SOAS.
The equipment purchased included a Zoom digital recorder, Shure head
microphones, a digital video camera, an external microphone for the
camcorder, a tripod, and additional materials. Throughout the duration of
the projects, a range of cultural and linguistic events were
documented. The Paresi communities selected materials for documentation such as
traditional stories, songs, blessings, festivals, indigenous games, and various dialects
or varieties of the Paresi language. In contrast, the Enawene
Nawe prioritized the recording of traditional narratives, including their origin
story, the account of the origin of cassava, stories about
spirits, and other similar content. Further details regarding the two
projects can be found in Brand√£o and Zezokiware (2018).
