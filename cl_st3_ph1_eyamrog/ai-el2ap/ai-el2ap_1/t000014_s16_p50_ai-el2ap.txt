The Paresi language documentation project commenced in 2006 and was
carried out through Brandão’s doctoral and postdoctoral research. The EN
language documentation project began in May 2019, with completion anticipated
by the end of 2022. The primary objective of both
projects was to compile an extensive corpus of audio and
video recordings representing a range of linguistic genres, with all
materials transcribed in the respective indigenous language and translated into
Portuguese.
