Only a single specimen of this species was collected during
the present study, and it exhibited some morphological differences compared
to the descriptions provided by Br√©bisson (1856) and Coesel &
Meesters (2007). Specifically, the specimen observed in this study had
a slightly convex middle region at the apex, rather than
a truncate form, and displayed concave apical angles instead of
straight ones.
