Initial preparation for a community-wide discussion on ethics and informed
consent was conducted on July 14, 2012, during a meeting
with two community members who were also serving as school
teachers in Arena Blanca and had agreed to act as
translators. The meeting revealed that explaining the concept of archiving
would likely present challenges for the external linguist, primarily due
to the complexity and technical nature of the subject matter.
Additionally, it was noted that the community lacked access to
the Internet and telephones, had no computers, and both teachers
had limited experience with such technology, which further complicated effective
communication of these concepts.
