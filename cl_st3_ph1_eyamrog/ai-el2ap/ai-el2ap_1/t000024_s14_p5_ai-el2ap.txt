The variables analyzed in this study included survival percentage, determined
by the number of dead plants, as well as the
number of emerging sprouts and the number of leaves. The
dependent variables, sprout emergence and survival, were assessed across nine
measurement intervals, while the number of leaves was recorded during
five measurement intervals between October 2015 and November 2016.
