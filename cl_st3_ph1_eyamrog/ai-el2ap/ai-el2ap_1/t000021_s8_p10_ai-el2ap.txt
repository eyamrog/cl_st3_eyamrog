Several issues have been identified in research on teachers' emotions.
Specifically, with regard to emotion regulation strategies and their outcomes,
existing studies often emphasize particular tactics employed by teachers. For
instance, Yin et al. (2016) found that teachers were more
likely to suppress rather than reappraise their emotions in situations
characterized by emotional exhaustion. Similarly, BuriÄ‡ et al. (2016) reported
that reappraisal is generally associated with more positive outcomes, whereas
suppression tends to correlate with increased exhaustion. These studies commonly
categorize teachers' emotion regulation strategies as either adaptive or maladaptive,
which may overlook the primary functions of these strategies as
well as the impact of individual and contextual factors.
