English for Specific Purposes (ESP) recognizes the complexity inherent in
language use, teaching, and learning. Consequently, specificity is a central
principle of the ESP approach. Specificity pertains to the linguistic,
textual, and contextual features of discourse associated with particular social
practices, or target situations, which must be identified to effectively
prepare students for participation in those practices through appropriate genre
use (Hyland, 2002). Additionally, specificity involves addressing the needs of
particular student groups (present situation) by facilitating the development of
their genre knowledge to a level that meets the standards
of the relevant discourse community.
