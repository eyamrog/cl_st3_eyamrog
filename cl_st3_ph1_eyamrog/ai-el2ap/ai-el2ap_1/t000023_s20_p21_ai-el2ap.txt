The present species exhibits a refractive thickening at the apex
of the semicells, a feature not typically observed in Cosmarium
difficile Lütkemüller. Among known forms, only C. difficile f. laeve
Scott & Prescott displays such apical thickening; however, this form
lacks the characteristic pore rows of the species. Therefore, the
current material is identified as C. difficile, primarily based on
the presence of the typical punctuation rows, despite the occurrence
of a feature not originally described for the species.
