This analysis of collaboration within Brazil in recent years demonstrates
that a low rate of international co-authorship in a country's
publications does not necessarily indicate institutional inbreeding or parochialism. Examination
of SciELO documents from 2016 to 2020 reveals that collaboration
among authors from different Brazilian states is a prominent feature
of the national scientific production landscape. Such collaboration involves research
teams situated in distinct geographic and institutional contexts, each with
diverse academic backgrounds and processes of institutionalization. These patterns of
inter-state collaboration are particularly evident in certain disciplinary areas, while,
as expected, fields characterized by smaller author teams tend to
exhibit lower levels of inter-state collaboration.
