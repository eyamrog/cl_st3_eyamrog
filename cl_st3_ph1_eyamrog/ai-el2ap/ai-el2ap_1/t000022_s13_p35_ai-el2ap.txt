The temporal evolution of the distribution of publication languages can
be analyzed to identify significant trends. Over the past decade,
the proportion of articles published in English has increased, primarily
at the expense of Portuguese, while the share of articles
in Spanish has remained relatively stable (see Figure 8). A
more detailed analysis of the two main linguistic contexts—Portuguese and
Spanish—reveals notable patterns. For Brazilian journals, the proportion of articles
published in English rose from 24% in 2009 to 58%
in 2018, with a corresponding decline in the proportion of
articles in Portuguese; the share of articles in Spanish remained
consistently low at approximately 3%. This increase in English-language publications
is observed across all disciplinary areas, although it is less
pronounced in the Social Sciences and Humanities and more prominent
in the Agricultural Sciences, Medical and Health Sciences, Engineering and
Technology, and Exact and Natural Sciences. The dominance of English
was already evident at the beginning of the period in
journals within the latter disciplinary area.
