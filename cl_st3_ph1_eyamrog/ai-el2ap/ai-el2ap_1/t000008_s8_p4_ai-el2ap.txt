Copernicia alba Morong is a palm species in the Arecaceae
family, native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America,
including the Chaco areas of Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia, as
well as the Pantanal in Brazil (Lorenzi et al. 2004).
Commonly referred to as “carandá” or caranday palm, this species
frequently forms monodominant stands in the Pantanal wetland, an environment
characterized by periodic flooding followed by dry seasons (Pott &
Pott 1994). Flooding in these areas can persist for up
to eight months annually (Pott & Pott 1994; Nunes-da-Cunha &
Junk 2011; Figure 1a). In its natural habitat, C. alba
displays early successional traits, demonstrates fire tolerance, and produces fruits
that serve as a food source for various wildlife, including
macaws, parrots, and fish (Pott & Pott 1994). The species
is also economically significant due to the durability of its
wood, which is commonly used in rural construction, particularly for
corrals and fences (Lorenzi et al. 2004; Pivetta et al.
2011).
