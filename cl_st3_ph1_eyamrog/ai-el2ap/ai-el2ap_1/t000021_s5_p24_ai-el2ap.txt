Another possible explanation may relate to the pedagogical training received
by teachers, which, although generally reported as ineffective by most
educators, can nonetheless provide some resources to address classroom demands
(Taxer & Gross, 2018). In this context, teachers in technical
fields appear more likely to report difficulties, as the majority
have backgrounds in engineering and technology, disciplines that have traditionally
placed less emphasis on pedagogical training.
