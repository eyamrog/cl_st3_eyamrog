In line with this body of research, we adopt the
perspective that a comprehensive analysis of the lived experiences of
migration among various social groups requires simultaneous attention to both
mobility and mooring (or re-mooring), as these processes are interrelated
(Hannam et al., 2006, p. 2). It is necessary to
examine the historical specificity of distinct migration trajectories while also
investigating the context-dependent mechanisms through which mooring or re-mooring occurs,
as well as the emergence and significance of new forms
of social organization, communities of practice (Wenger, 1998), and social
activities. Research in anthropology and cultural studies (e.g., Brah, 1996;
Fortier, 2000; Ahmed et al., 2003) has maintained this dual
focus by documenting experiences of dislocation and displacement, and by
elucidating the social and cultural processes underlying mooring, reterritorialization, or
what Ahmed et al. (2003) term regrounding.
