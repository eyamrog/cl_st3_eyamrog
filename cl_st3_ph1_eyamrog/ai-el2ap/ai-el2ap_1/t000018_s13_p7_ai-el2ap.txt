From this perspective, in the educational sciences, information obtained from
evaluative methods serves diagnostic, evaluative, and formative functions. The diagnostic
function involves identifying the needs and potentialities of the child,
as indicated in the reviewed articles that utilize Luria's theory,

and educational agencies involved in the child's education. Furthermore, the
evaluative function of assessment is acknowledged, as the perspectives of
the family and educational agencies are essential for defining the
child's needs, educational trajectory, and developmental progress.
