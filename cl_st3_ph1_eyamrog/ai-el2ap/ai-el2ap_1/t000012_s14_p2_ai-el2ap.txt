We calculated the dietary diversity index (H) for bird species
observed engaging in cleaning behavior in Brazil and Africa, as
reported in Sazima et al. (2012) and Mikula et al.
(2017). Based on the identified cleaner bird species, we determined
the families to which these species belong, resulting in a
total of 26 families. We then compared the mean H
of all species within these 26 families, excluding the observed
cleaners, to the mean H of the cleaner species within
the same families (Fig. 2). The objective was to assess
whether cleaner species exhibit a bias toward more generalized diet
habits, under the hypothesis that cleaners represent the more dietarily
diverse members of their respective families. Detailed values of the
calculated H for both species and families are provided in
Supplementary Fig. 1.
