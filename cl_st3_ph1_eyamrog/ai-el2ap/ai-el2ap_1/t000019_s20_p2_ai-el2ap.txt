The initial national curricular guidelines in Brazil (Brasil, 1997; 1998)
already exhibited instrumental and deterministic perspectives on technology (Costa, 2020).
These documents provided the framework for Brazilian basic education until
2017, when the final version of the National Common Curricular
Base (BNCC) was published (Brasil, 2017), which remains the current
regulatory document.
