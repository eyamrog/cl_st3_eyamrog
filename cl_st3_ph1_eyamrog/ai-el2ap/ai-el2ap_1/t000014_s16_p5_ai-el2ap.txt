Until 2009, the work of linguists at the Goeldi Institute
generated a substantial and diverse collection of recording media, including
cassette tapes, DAT tapes, mini-disks, Hi-8 tapes, and mini-DV tapes.
Due to limitations in time and funding, this collection was
stored unsystematically in drawers. Between 2009 and 2014, linguist Ana
Vilacy Galucio led a project funded by the CFDD/Ministry of
Justice to digitize and catalog the collection in accordance with
international archival standards. To increase the efficiency of cataloging and
metadata management, Sebastian Drude and Rose Costa developed scripts that
reduced the required processing time by 70%. As a result,
the Goeldi Instituteâ€™s digital linguistic archive was established.
