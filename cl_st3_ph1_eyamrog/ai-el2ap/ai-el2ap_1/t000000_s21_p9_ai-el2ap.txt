Currently, two species and two hybrid-origin species are recognized within
the group (Thomson 2012; Zhou et al. 2014; Schwartsburd et
al. 2018, 2020). Additionally, approximately 20 morpho-taxa are identified as
infraspecific entities, including subspecies, varieties, forms, or combinations of these
ranks (e.g., Tryon 1941; Page 1976; Thomson 2012; Schwartsburd et
al. 2018). In Brazil, the recognized taxa are Pteridium caudatum
(L.) Maxon, P. esculentum subsp. arachnoideum, P. esculentum subsp. campestre
(Schrad.) Schwartsb. & J. Prado, P. esculentum subsp. gryphus Schwartsb.,
P. esculentum var. harpianum Schwartsb. & A. Ya√±ez, and P.
esculentum var. paedomorficum Schwartsb. & J. Prado (Schwartsburd 2020). Among
these, P. esculentum subsp. arachnoideum is the most prevalent taxon
in southeastern Brazil, where it is known to invade agricultural
fields and exhibits toxicity to cattle, horses, and humans upon
ingestion (Schwartsburd et al. 2018).
