For didactic purposes, the following sections are organized according to
quantitative and qualitative methods. Each section provides a concise overview
of a specific analytical procedure and demonstrates its application to
authentic classroom discourse data collected in a previous project. The
research questions and findings are included solely as illustrative examples
of how paradigms and methods can be operationalized. Consequently, the
aim is not to engage in a discussion of the
substantive insights into dialogic teaching that may be derived from
these data.
