Statistical analysis – To assess the effects of gradual dehydration
over time on structural Young’s modulus, fracture toughness, and relative
water content in stems and leaves, we constructed both linear
and nonlinear mixed models, with parameter estimation performed using restricted
maximum likelihood (REML). In these models, time was included as
an independent variable, and samples were consistently incorporated as a
random effect to account for repeated measurements of each sample
over time. Nonlinear mixed models were also developed to evaluate
the direct effect of relative water content on the structural
Young’s modulus of stems and the fracture toughness of leaves
during gradual dehydration. Exponential nonlinear models were selected to represent
the best-fit curves, following approaches used by Boldrin et al.
(2018) and Scoffoni et al. (2014). Model assumptions were evaluated
through residual analysis and graphical inspection, as recommended by Crawley
(2007). Statistical significance was determined using analysis of variance (ANOVA),
with a threshold of P ≤ 0.05 (Zar 1996). All
statistical analyses were conducted in R version 3.6.1 (R Core
Team 2019) using the lme4 package (Bates 2010).
