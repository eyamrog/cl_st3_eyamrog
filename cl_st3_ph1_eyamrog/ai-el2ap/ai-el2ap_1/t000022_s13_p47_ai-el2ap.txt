Another point to note is that the nine states analyzed
display similar percentages across the different types of collaboration. The
variations observed in the table are minor, indicating that these
patterns are relatively stable characteristics of the Brazilian scientific production
landscape. To further support this conclusion, a comparison is made
with a region that differs significantly from the Northeast. Table
7 presents data on collaboration in the five most productive
states. The primary feature in this context is the higher
degree of in-state collaboration, which exceeds 50% in all cases
and is more pronounced than in the Northeast. For each
state listed, the proportion of collaboration with the other four
states is approximately equivalent (as shown in the fourth column),
as is the proportion with all other states in Brazil
(fifth column). This demonstrates a clear concentration of collaborative activity
within institutions located in these five states. However, it is
also evident that, although less frequent, collaboration with states that
are less prominent in the Brazilian scientific landscape is not
entirely negligible. Finally, the notable similarity in the collaboration profiles
of the five states in Table 7 may indicate, as
previously mentioned, the presence of consistent trends in this area
of collaboration.
