The study reported in Author (XXXX) addressed three research questions
concerning group-work interaction: (1) How can small-group dialogue in a
Brazilian primary school be characterised? (2) How did this dialogue
change over the course of the intervention? and (3) Did
the groups become more dialogic? The research was conducted within
the context of a teacher professional development programme designed to
promote dialogic talk in both small-group work and whole-class teaching.
