Based on the analyzed data, access to information and communication
technology (ICT) in Brazil has increased in quantitative terms, primarily
through the widespread use of mobile phones; however, qualitative access
has declined due to a significant reduction in the use
of computer devices that facilitate more complex academic and professional
activities, as well as diminished access through schools and other
public institutions, as previously demonstrated. Furthermore, the acquisition of academic
and professional knowledge related to ICT among teachers has shown
minimal progress, as indicated by the findings of the referenced
literature review.
