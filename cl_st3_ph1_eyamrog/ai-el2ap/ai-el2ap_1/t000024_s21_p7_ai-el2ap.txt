The results of the relocation experiment for A. distichantha (Table
5) indicated that specimens transplanted as terricolous did not exhibit
statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) in the number of
sprouts between phenological stages during any observation period. Additionally, no
statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) in sprout number were
observed over time for soil-transplanted specimens, regardless of phenological stage.
These findings suggest that soil transplantation is independent of the
phenological stage in A. distichantha. In contrast, specimens transplanted as
epiphytes during the vegetative stage showed a statistically significant increase
in sprout number over time (p â‰¤ 0.05), with an
approximate 10% increase at 252 days, stabilizing at 1.06 and
1.12 sprouts. However, epiphytic specimens transplanted during the reproductive stage
did not exhibit statistically significant changes (p > 0.05) in
sprout number over time (Table 5). The production of new
organs such as sprouts may be associated with leaf senescence,
which functions as a nutrient recycling process and contributes to
more efficient resource management (Guiboileau et al. 2010). The observed
increase in sprout number in vegetative-stage epiphytes may be attributed
to abiotic stress, which can induce axillary sprout formation, whereas
reproductive-stage epiphytes did not show a significant increase, likely because
sprout production had already been induced during floral scape development.
