To address the first research question, the analysis was conducted
using the entire dataset. Group talk was examined in aggregate,
and relative code frequencies were calculated by dividing the number
of content-related utterances (codes 1 to 6), instruction-related utterances (code
7), and off-topic utterances (code 8) by the total number
of utterances. As shown in Figure 1, groups devoted approximately
56% of their utterances to content-related discussion, 25% to negotiating
task instructions, and 19% to off-topic conversation. Thus, only about
half of the group work focused on content, which is
the type of discourse most directly associated with conceptual and
disciplinary learning gains.
