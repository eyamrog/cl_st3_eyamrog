Intellectual performance refers to the capacity to synthesize and analyze
information within a specific or guided context. This includes the
ability to group objects based on attributes such as color,
shape, or size, as well as to construct arrangements using
physical objects, images, or drawn figures. It also encompasses the
organization of ideas during the creation of narratives or stories.
Additionally, intellectual performance involves the extent and manner in which
individuals compare objects based on characteristics such as similarities and
differences, or by quantitative measures such as size (e.g., larger
versus smaller). The speed and accuracy with which individuals enumerate
and compare quantities, particularly within the range of one to
ten objects, are also considered important indicators of intellectual performance.
