Operational and everyday uses, being primarily task-oriented and lacking comprehensive
explanatory or relational elements, contribute minimally to the advancement of
knowledge that fosters critical and creative thinking. Their primary focus
is on the execution and completion of tasks rather than
on providing explanations or facilitating understanding, and as such, they
offer limited support for broader intellectual development.
