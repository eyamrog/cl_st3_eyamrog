Heterogeneity arises when a sample contains a mixture of two
or more distinct genomic sequences rather than a single, uniform
genome. This phenomenon can manifest at small scales, such as
the presence of different nucleotide bases at a specific locus,
or at larger scales, such as variations in structural genome
configurations. Low-level heterogeneity, where the vast majority of sequencing reads
support one sequence (e.g., 95%) and a minority support another
(e.g., 5%), typically does not interfere with genome assembly or
polishing, as assembly algorithms generally favor the predominant sequence. In
contrast, balanced heterogeneity, such as a 50:50 mixture of alternatives,
can lead to misassemblies and errors during polishing. In Enterobacteriaceae,
phase variation of the fim switch is a known source
of heterogeneity (Figure 2E). Another frequent example involves bacteriophages, which
can integrate into and excise from bacterial chromosomes (Figure 2F).
Indicators of heterogeneity include incomplete assembly graphs and regions with
dense clusters of changes introduced by polishing tools. In such
cases, it may be necessary to manually exclude reads supporting
one of the alternatives to enable accurate assembly and polishing
of the remaining sequence.
