As a further, though still preliminary, analysis of citation practices
related to JUOJS, the most-cited articles in English, Indonesian, and
Portuguese were examined to determine the extent to which they
are cited by JUOJS or by other publications. For the
leading English-language article, published in the Journal of Statistical Software
and cited 16,432 times, 95% of citations originate from sources
outside JUOJS (Table 4), indicating that the journal contributes substantially
to the broader research literature. In contrast, the most-cited articles
in Indonesian, published in Jurnal Ekonomi dan Pendidikan, and in
Portuguese, published in Outra Travessia, have lower citation counts (1,321
and 1,408, respectively), with a significantly higher proportion of citations
coming from JUOJS itself. Specifically, 73.2% of citations to the
leading Indonesian article and 77.7% of citations to the leading
Portuguese article are from JUOJS, suggesting a more central role
for JUOJS in scholarly communication within these languages, although approximately
one-fifth of citations still originate from other sources. Further systematic
research is required to better understand these patterns of citation
and their implications for scholarly communication, which will be addressed
in future studies.
