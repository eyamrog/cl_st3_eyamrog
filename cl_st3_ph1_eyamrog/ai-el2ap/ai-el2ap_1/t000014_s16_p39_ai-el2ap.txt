The field techniques used to obtain information adhered to established
standards, with modifications made as necessary to address specific data
requirements. A journal was maintained, and daily measurements of temperature,
humidity, and precipitation were recorded at the camp. Data collected
through observation and interviews were systematically documented on four-by-six slips
or other suitable formats, prepared in duplicate and annotated with
the date, location, and informantâ€™s name. Additionally, specimens, photographs, and
tape recordings were collected whenever feasible to ensure comprehensive documentation.
