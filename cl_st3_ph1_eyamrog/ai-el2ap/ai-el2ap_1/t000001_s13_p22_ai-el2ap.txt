Demultiplexing errors may occur during multiplexed sequencing runs, leading to
the misassignment of reads from one barcode to another and
resulting in low-level contamination. When a sequence associated with a
particular barcode is present at very high depth, it can
appear in other barcodes at sufficient coverage to allow assembly.
This phenomenon is most frequently observed with high-copy-number plasmids (Figure
2D). Therefore, when multiple genome assemblies from the same sequencing
run contain identical plasmids, cross-barcode contamination should be considered as
a potential explanation.
