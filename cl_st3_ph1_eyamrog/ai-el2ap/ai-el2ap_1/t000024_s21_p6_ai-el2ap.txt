During the initial stage of establishment in a new environment,
specifically between bromeliad removal and relocation, nutritional deficiency may occur
due to limited nutrient availability. This deficiency can contribute to
the inactivation of the apical bud and subsequently stimulate the
production of axillary sprouts. Freitas et al. (1998) suggest that
leaf loss observed during establishment in a new environment may
be associated with natural senescence or represent an adaptive response.
