As Mestre João Grande explained, and as Mestre Ananias has
also noted on several occasions, capoeira, samba, and candomblé are
interconnected practices that share common African origins. Candomblé functioned primarily
as a religion, while samba served as a form of
dance for leisure and socialization. However, samba also historically incorporated
elements of self-defense. Variants such as samba-de-coco and samba duro,
as well as practices like pernada among men, were performed
in public spaces and sometimes involved techniques, such as rasteiras,
that could be used to physically subdue others. (Interview with
