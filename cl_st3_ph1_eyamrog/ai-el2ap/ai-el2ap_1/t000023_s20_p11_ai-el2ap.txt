The cell is approximately 1.1 times longer than broad, with
a pronounced median constriction and a linear sinus. Semicells are
semicircular with rounded apices and angles. The cell wall is
smooth. Each cell contains a single chloroplast and one pyrenoid
per semicell. Cell length ranges from 11.1 to 17.8 µm,
width from 9.7 to 15.2 µm, and isthmus width from
3.1 to 5.4 µm.
