There are notable asymmetries in the patterns of collaboration among
authors from different states. An analysis of co-authorship networks, focusing
on the top five collaborating states for authors from each
state, indicates that São Paulo is a leading collaborator in
26 instances, followed by Minas Gerais in 25, Rio de
Janeiro in 21, Rio Grande do Sul in 14, and
Paraná in 12. Pernambuco and Brasília follow with 7 and
5 instances, respectively. Additionally, seven states do not appear among
the top five collaborative partners for any other state.
