The integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) in education
is essential due to their significant cultural role in contemporary
society. However, it is important to implement ICT through critical
pedagogical approaches that account for their socio-historical and cultural dimensions
to promote comprehensive human development. Failure to do so risks
perpetuating digital exclusion, particularly among low-income populations, and reinforces existing
instrumental and deterministic pedagogical models. Rather than opposing the incorporation
of digital information and communication technologies (DICT) in schools—which can
exacerbate exclusion—it is necessary to ensure high-quality conditions in public
schools and to provide adequate human resources to enhance the
quality of teaching.
