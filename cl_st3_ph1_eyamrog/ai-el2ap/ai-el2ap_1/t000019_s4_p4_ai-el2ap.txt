Although the BNCC's guidance on Digital Information and Communication Technologies
(DICT) is neither critical nor emancipatory, its absence in schools
disregards the material significance of these technologies in contemporary society
and perpetuates existing social hierarchies. Excluding ICT from educational processes,
under the justification that not all students have access, neither
protects those without access nor contributes to efforts aimed at
improving the conditions necessary for equitable inclusion. Moreover, the lack
of ICT integration in schools eliminates the possibility of engaging
with these technologies from a critical perspective, thereby reinforcing instrumental
and deterministic approaches to their use.
