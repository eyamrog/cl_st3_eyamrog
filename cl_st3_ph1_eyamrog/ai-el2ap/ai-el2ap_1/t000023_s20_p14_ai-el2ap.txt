The cell is 1.4 to 1.5 times longer than broad,
with a deep median constriction and a widely open sinus.
Semicells are ellipsoid with rounded apices and angles. The cell
wall is punctate. Each cell contains a single chloroplast and
one pyrenoid per semicell. Cells are frequently enclosed within a
spherical, inconspicuous mucilaginous envelope. Cell length ranges from 15.9 to
24.7 µm, width from 10.9 to 17.4 µm, and isthmus
width from 3 to 4.4 µm.
