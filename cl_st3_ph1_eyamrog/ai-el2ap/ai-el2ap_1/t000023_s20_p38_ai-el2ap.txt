The cell is 1.6 to 1.7 times longer than broad,
with a deep median constriction and a widely open sinus.
Each semicell is subcircular, with a broadly rounded apex, convex
lateral margins, and rounded angles. The cell wall is smooth.
There is a single chloroplast per cell, with one pyrenoid
present in each semicell. Cell dimensions are as follows: length
29.7–34.8 µm, width 17.5–21.3 µm, and isthmus 4.5–6.5 µm.
