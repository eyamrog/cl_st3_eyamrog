Our initial field visits to Northern Ireland took place in
October 2014 and June 2015. During these visits, we conducted
participant observation in various public settings, including a Catholic church
in Dungannon and local sports events, particularly football matches, and
maintained detailed field notes throughout. We also employed still photography
and collected a range of texts and artefacts, including digital
materials such as Facebook and YouTube postings. Additionally, we conducted
extended, semi-structured face-to-face interviews with twelve Timorese men residing and
working in Dungannon and Cookstown. The interviews were conducted primarily
in Tetum, with occasional use of Portuguese and/or English, and
each interview lasted approximately one hour and was audio-recorded. Six
interviews were conducted individually, while the remainder were joint interviews
with football team members. The interviews focused on the participantsâ€™
migration trajectories and their lived experiences of mooring or re-mooring
within the Northern Irish context. The six individual interviewees formed
the core group of research participants (see Table 1 below).
