The cell is 1.2 to 1.3 times longer than broad,
with a deep median constriction and a linear sinus. Semicells
are hexagonal with rounded angles and an apex that is
truncate to retuse. The cell wall is smooth. Each cell
contains a single chloroplast, with one pyrenoid present per semicell.
Cell length ranges from 16.5 to 22 µm, width from
14.8 to 17.3 µm, and isthmus width from 3.7 to
4.8 µm.
