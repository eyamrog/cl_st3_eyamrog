In addition to regular training sessions, capoeira workshops are conducted
by visiting mestres, who typically arrive either directly from Brazil
or from other countries to which they have relocated, often
for the purpose of teaching capoeira. These mestres may have
limited proficiency in English or may not speak English at
all, making Portuguese the primary language of communication during the
workshops. In the two workshops observed, the mestres primarily addressed
the students in Portuguese, with Sandro providing interpretation of some
of their statements into English. Social interaction commonly occurs at
the conclusion of the workshops, during which Portuguese is frequently
used for informal communication.
