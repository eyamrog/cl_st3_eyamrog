The cell is approximately 1.1 times broader than it is
long, with a deep median constriction and a linear sinus.
The semicells are semicircular, with a truncate apex and rounded
angles. The cell wall is punctate. Each cell contains two
chloroplasts, with two pyrenoids per semicell. The cell length is
approximately 29.9 µm, the width is approximately 32.8 µm, and
the isthmus is approximately 10.4 µm.
