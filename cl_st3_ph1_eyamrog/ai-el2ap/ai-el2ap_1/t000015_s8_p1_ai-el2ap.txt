In 2018, Philip G. Altbach and Hans de Wit, scholars
of higher education at Boston College, published an article titled
“Too Much Academic Research Is Being Published” in University World
News. They argue that the number of scientific journals, estimated
at approximately 30,000, is excessive and indicative of a “crisis
in academic publishing,” characterized by increased pressure on leading journals
and the proliferation of predatory publishers that disseminate research of
low or marginal quality. Altbach and de Wit advocate for
measures to reduce the volume of published research. In contrast,
the present analysis questions the accuracy of such journal estimates
and emphasizes the importance of acknowledging the research contributions and
engagement of the Global South. This analysis is based on
data from 25,671 journals utilizing the open source editorial management
and publishing platform Open Journal Systems (OJS), which was first
released by the Public Knowledge Project (PKP) in 2002. The
authors’ association with PKP is disclosed in the Competing Interests
statement at the conclusion of this article.
