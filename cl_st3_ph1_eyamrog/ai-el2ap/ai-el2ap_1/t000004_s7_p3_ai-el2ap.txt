Communication during the capoeira sessions we observed utilized a wide
range of modalities, including identifiable languages such as English and
Portuguese, specific varieties of Portuguese such as Afro-Brazilian Portuguese, as
well as gesture and bodily movement. These modalities interact with,
are regulated by, and are supplemented by the modality of
music, whose rhythms structure the progression of each component within
the capoeira session. In this study, we employ the concept
of translanguaging to analyze these interactions and interpret the overall
communicative process through the framework of Deleuze and Guattariâ€™s concept
of assemblage (Deleuze & Guattari, 2013). As noted by Canagarajah,
the assemblage framework facilitates an understanding of how diverse semiotic
resources are integrated within activities such as capoeira.
