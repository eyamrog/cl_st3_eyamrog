As previously noted, Brazil plays a central role in the
analysis of the scientific journal landscape in Latin America. Brazilian
journals represent 29.4% of the 1,720 journals included in the
OLIVA corpus. In terms of disciplinary distribution, the majority of
these journals are classified under Medical and Health Sciences (34.3%)
and Natural and Exact Sciences (33%). In contrast, lower proportions
are observed in the Humanities (23.9%), Engineering and Technology (19.3%),
and Multidisciplinary-SSH (17.9%). The significance of Brazil's contribution is more
accurately reflected by the proportion of articles published in its
journals; overall, 50.1% of the articles in the OLIVA database
appear in Brazilian journals. This proportion is even higher in
specific disciplines, with Agricultural Sciences at 65.8%, Multidisciplinary at 58.8%,
Medical and Health Sciences at 54.5%, and Natural and Exact
Sciences at 53.9%.
