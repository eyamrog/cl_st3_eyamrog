The objective of long-read assembly is to generate contiguous sequences
that are free of structural errors, such that any remaining
inaccuracies are limited to small-scale variants, including single-base substitutions, insertions,
or deletions. This approach is adopted because subsequent polishing steps
are effective at correcting small-scale errors but are generally insufficient
for resolving larger structural inaccuracies.
