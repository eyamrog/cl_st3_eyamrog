Recent research in emotion regulation has demonstrated that the effectiveness
of regulatory strategies varies according to contextual factors (Aldao, Sheppes,
& Gross, 2015; Gross, 2015). Consequently, the efficacy and appropriateness
of a given strategy should not be evaluated in isolation,
as its adaptive value—including associated costs and benefits—depends on the
specific context in which it is employed (Aldao, Sheppes, &
Gross, 2015; Gross, 2015). Additionally, each attempt at emotion regulation
can result in changes to the individual employing the strategy,
the situation itself, and the individuals involved in the interaction.
These changes may, in turn, create new demands for emotion
regulation and necessitate the use of additional strategies in a
non-linear and iterative manner until further regulation is no longer
required, thereby establishing a feedback loop (Gross, 2015; Taxer &
Gross, 2018). These considerations reflect recent developments in the field
of emotion regulation, as highlighted by Taxer and Gross (2018).
Nevertheless, this dynamic model has not been thoroughly investigated, particularly
in occupational settings, where research has predominantly focused on two
primary strategies: cognitive reappraisal and suppression (Mallory & Rupp, 2016).
