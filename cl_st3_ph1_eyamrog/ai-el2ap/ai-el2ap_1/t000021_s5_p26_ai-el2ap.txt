Consistent with the findings of Taxer and Gross (2018), the
present results indicate that teachers frequently employ multiple emotion regulation
strategies simultaneously. However, whereas Taxer and Gross (2018) emphasized the
use of attention deployment, the current study found that cognitive
change was more prominent and appeared to be associated with
situation modification, such as relational coping. Specifically, when confronted with
challenging situations and discussing these events with students, teachers may
both influence students’ emotion regulation (hetero-regulation) and reinterpret adverse circumstances
themselves (self-regulation). The second most notable association observed was between
situation selection (technical approach) and situation modification (technological confrontation). These
findings suggest that teachers draw on prior experiences to anticipate
both their own and their students’ emotional responses, and utilize
technical-pedagogical knowledge to plan for, anticipate, and address negative situations
in the classroom, as well as to modify these situations
when they cannot be avoided.
