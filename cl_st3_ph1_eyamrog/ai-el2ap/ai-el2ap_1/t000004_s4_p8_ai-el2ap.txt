This study began with the question of how capoeira in
diaspora contexts might facilitate Portuguese language learning, particularly an Afro-Brazilian
variety of Portuguese. The concept of translanguaging prompted an examination
of the complex interplay between language, embodied action, and music
within capoeira practice. It became apparent that viewing capoeira solely
as an opportunity for Portuguese acquisition was overly reductive. Consequently,
capoeira practice was reconceptualized as a register, constructed from a
range of semiotic modes, including multiple language varieties, with language
learning understood as a process of enregisterment within this context.
Another research question concerned whether the Portuguese acquired through capoeira
would be sufficient for broader language proficiency. For some capoeiristas
interviewed, capoeira served as an entry point toward fluency in
Portuguese, while for others it did not. Nonetheless, engagement with
capoeira appears to have the potential to enhance Portuguese language
learning more generally. From a language acquisition perspective, combining exposure
to Portuguese through capoeira with other learning methods is likely
to be most effective. The investigation initially drew on concepts
such as informal learning and language learning in naturalistic settings,
and the findings indicate that capoeira is a multi-layered and
complexly organized practice. However, in typical diasporic capoeira groups, Portuguese
language learning tends to remain informal and incidental, with instructors
generally not perceiving themselves as language teachers. The study concludes
that conceptualizing language learning as enregisterment is a promising approach
that could be applied more broadly to mainstream language learning
contexts.
