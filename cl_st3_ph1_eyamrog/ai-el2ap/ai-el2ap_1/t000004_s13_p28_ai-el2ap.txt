Sandro asked whether capoeira should be classified as a dance,
a martial art disguised as a dance, or a dance
disguised as another form of dance. A student then inquired
how Sandro would describe capoeira. Sandro responded that capoeira represents
Brazilian culture, noting that it involves both combat and performance
elements, as practitioners simulate fighting within the context of a
dance. (Fieldnotes)
