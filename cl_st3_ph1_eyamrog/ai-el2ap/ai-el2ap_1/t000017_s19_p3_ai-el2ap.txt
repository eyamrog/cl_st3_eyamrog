The study employed factor analysis using the maximum likelihood method
with quartimax rotation; however, this approach yielded three factors that
accounted for 47.61% of the common variance. This result does
not satisfy the criterion proposed by Cuadras (2016), which states
that an adequate factor analysis should explain at least 60%
of the common variance.
