The above indicates that research based on Luria's theory, in
both adults and children, has focused on the individualized analysis

In the field of educational sciences, educators extend their analysis
to the holistic development of the child and also consider
the group context to organize and adjust their educational strategies,
thereby modulating the pace of the educational process as needed.
Consequently, educators utilize evaluation data not only for diagnostic purposes
but also for formative objectives, applying this information to support
the development of the individual child, the group, and the
family.
