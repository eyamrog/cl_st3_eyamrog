The described method necessitates human judgment and intervention, particularly during
the Trycycler and short-read polishing steps. This involvement enables users
to identify and address unexpected results, thereby preventing low-quality data
from advancing to subsequent stages. While this approach is suitable
in contexts where accuracy is critical, such as reference genome
assembly, it is not amenable to full automation (e.g., with
Nextflow) and is therefore unsuitable for high-throughput assembly applications.
