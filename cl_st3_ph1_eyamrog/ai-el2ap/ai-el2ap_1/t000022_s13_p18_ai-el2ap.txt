Collaboration in the articles published in journals included in OLIVA
exhibits notable variation across disciplinary areas. Overall, 25.8% of the
articles are single-authored, but this proportion differs substantially by field
(see Table 3). In the Humanities, single-authored articles constitute 77.2%
of the total, whereas in the Social Sciences, this figure
is 49.3%. In the Humanities, 19% of articles are co-authored
by two or three individuals, and only 3.8% involve more
than three authors. In contrast, in the Social Sciences, 40.8%
of articles have two or three authors, and 10% have
between four and eight authors. Multidisciplinary Social Sciences and Humanities
(SSH) journals display intermediate patterns of authorship, with percentages falling
between those observed in the Humanities and Social Sciences.
