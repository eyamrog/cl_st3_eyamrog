This study examined vocational and technological education due to the
inherent complexity of this educational context. Vocational and technological education
represents a hybrid model that integrates multiple educational levels and
modalities, including basic education, higher education (such as baccalaureate and
graduate programs), as well as professional and continuing education courses.
It also encompasses research, extension activities, and initiatives related to
technological development (Pacheco & Morigi, 2012). These characteristics are associated
with a broad and diverse student population and are presumed
to place increasing emotional demands on teachers (Morais, Gondim, &
Palma, 2020). Additionally, the recent implementation of this educational model
and the limited availability of research addressing psychosocial issues within
this context were taken into account.
