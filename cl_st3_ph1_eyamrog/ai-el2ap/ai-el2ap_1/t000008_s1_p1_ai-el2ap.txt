Palm seeds typically exhibit dormancy and possess a thick endocarp
that impedes germination and embryo development; however, water treatments have
the potential to enhance the germination process. Furthermore, ex-situ conservation
practices may result in a decline in seed viability over
time. Information regarding seed dormancy and storage effects remains limited
for many native palm species in Brazil. This study evaluated
the effects of water treatments and one-year storage on the
germination of Copernicia alba Morong, a palm species native to
the Brazilian Pantanal wetland. Fresh and stored pyrenes were subjected
to water immersion at room temperature for 24, 48, and
72 hours, as well as hot water treatments at approximately
75Â°C for 5 and 10 minutes. Fresh pyrenes exhibited a
germination rate of up to 84% in the control group,
which increased to 100% following water immersion for 48 and
72 hours. In contrast, one-year storage reduced germination by nearly
50%, although water immersion produced a modest increase in the
germination of stored pyrenes. Hot water treatments resulted in decreased
germination rates for both fresh and stored pyrenes. The seeds
of C. alba demonstrate characteristics consistent with orthodox seed storage
behavior. Overall, water treatments at room temperature were effective in
improving pyrene germination, whereas prolonged storage and hot water treatments
negatively affected germination outcomes.
