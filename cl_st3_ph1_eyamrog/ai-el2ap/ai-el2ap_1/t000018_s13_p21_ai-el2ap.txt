The tests developed by Luria in the 20th century can
be adapted for use in preschool children to assess motor
skills, language, memory, lateralization of functions, and thinking (30, 31).
For instance, Luria employed a task involving the learning of
10 words over 5 trials to evaluate the psychophysiological functioning
of the temporal lobe and its connections with subcortical structures.
In educational settings, this task can be utilized to assess
the development of memory in children, including their ability to
learn songs, recall the names of objects and verbal instructions,
and follow a sequence of actions specified by the educator
to achieve a particular objective.
