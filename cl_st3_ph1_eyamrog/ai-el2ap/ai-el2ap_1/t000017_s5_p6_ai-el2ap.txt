In story comprehension, a task analogous to subtest 3 "story
recall" of the Woodcock-Muñoz Battery III achievement test (Muñoz-Sandoval et
al., 2005), the child is required to listen carefully to
a narrative in order to understand its explicit content, including
the identification of characters, their relationships, and the overall plot,
and subsequently answer six literal questions about each story. This
subtest is significantly associated with oral language development, and the
Woodcock-Muñoz Battery III categorizes "story recall" within the comprehension-knowledge factor.
However, successful performance on the story comprehension subtest also demands
high levels of focused attention and working memory, as the
child must maintain, manipulate, and transform relevant information from the
narrative. Notably, this subtest does not provide visual support, making
attentive listening and retention of information essential. Therefore, the latent
variables underlying performance on the story comprehension subtest appear to
be more closely related to executive functions than to linguistic
abilities, although this conclusion may be subject to change in
future research depending on sample size.
