In classifying the disciplinary scope of journals, we encountered challenges
arising from the varying classification systems employed by different indexing
databases, including inconsistencies in the grouping of journals into scientific
areas. Consequently, a single journal could be assigned to different
disciplines and areas depending on the database. For the OLIVA
database, we adopted a classification framework based on the criteria
outlined in the OECD and Frascati Manual. The assignment of
one or more disciplines to each journal was conducted through
an empirical review of the descriptions provided in the "Scope"
or "About" sections on the official websites of the journals.
Subsequently, journals were grouped into eight subject areas: (1) Agricultural
Sciences, (2) Social Sciences, (3) Humanities, (4) Engineering and Technology,
(5) Medical and Health, (6) Natural and Exact Sciences, (7)
Multidisciplinary, and (8) Multidisciplinary-Social Sciences & Humanities (SSH). The presence
of two multidisciplinary categories reflects the substantial number of journals
in the OLIVA database with broad and diverse scopes that
transcend conventional disciplinary boundaries. Specifically, group 7 includes journals that
span at least two subject areas, combining “hard” sciences with
SSH, while group 8 comprises journals that integrate subject areas
exclusively within the Social Sciences and Humanities. This classification approach
reduced inconsistencies and enabled a more accurate assessment of the
disciplinary distribution of the journals analyzed.
