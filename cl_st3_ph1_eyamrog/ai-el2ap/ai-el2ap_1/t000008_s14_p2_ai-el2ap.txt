Germination of pretreated pyrenes—Freshly harvested pyrenes were used to assess
the effects of water soaking compared to untreated controls under
laboratory conditions. For the pretreatment, pyrenes were immersed in water
at room temperature (approximately 25°C) for 24, 48, or 72
hours, or in hot water at 75°C for either 5
or 10 minutes. The seeds were placed in plastic trays
(20 × 30 × 9 cm) and kept immersed under
constant fluorescent light for the specified durations, with water replaced
daily.
