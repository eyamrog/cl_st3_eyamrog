Methodology is commonly understood as the process of selecting and
applying specific methods or techniques for data analysis within a
study. However, a more comprehensive perspective defines methodology as encompassing
the researcherâ€™s alignment with particular epistemological and theoretical traditions, which
influence not only the choice of methods but also the
formulation of research questions and the overall research design (Mercer
et al., 2004; Taber, 2012, 2013; Treagust et al., 2014).
