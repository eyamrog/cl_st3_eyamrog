Proficiency in English is increasingly utilized by employment agencies as
a criterion for employee selection. For instance, an initial screening
process often involves interviewing applicants in English prior to providing
them with an application form. Individuals demonstrating some level of
English proficiency are subsequently assigned to positions with greater responsibility,
such as supervisory roles or assisting veterinary staff with poultry
inspection. These recruitment and workplace practices contribute to the establishment
of a linguistic hierarchy, as described by DuchÃªne et al.
(2013). Within this framework, Timorese migrants are experiencing a re-stratification
of their linguistic resources; specifically, those who previously benefited from
their knowledge of Portuguese in Timor-Leste now find that these
skills are not valued in their current work environments.
