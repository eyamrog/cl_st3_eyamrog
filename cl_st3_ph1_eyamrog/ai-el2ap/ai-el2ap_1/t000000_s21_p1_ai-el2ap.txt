Dennstaedtiaceae, Lindsaeaceae, and Saccolomataceae are represented by a total of
four genera and six species in the Viçosa region. Four
of these species include infra-specific classifications, which are recognized in
this study. The six taxa identified are: Dennstaedtia cicutaria (Sw.)
T. Moore and Pteridium esculentum subsp. arachnoideum (Kaulf.) J.A. Thomson
(Dennstaedtiaceae); Lindsaea lancea (L.) Bedd. var. lancea, L. quadrangularis Raddi
subsp. quadrangularis, and L. stricta (Sw.) Dryand. var. stricta (Lindsaeaceae);
and Saccoloma elegans Kaulf. Of these, only L. quadrangularis subsp.
quadrangularis and S. elegans are endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic
Rainforest, while the remaining taxa are widely distributed throughout the
Neotropics. In contrast to other families previously studied—Salviniaceae (Miranda &
Schwartsburd 2016), Anemiaceae (Rabelo & Schwartsburd 2016), and Polypodiaceae (Gonçalves
da Silva & Schwartsburd 2017)—we were unable to relocate half
of the taxa reported in this study, which were last
collected in the 1930s. This absence may be attributable to
local extinction resulting from forest fragmentation and disturbance. Specifically, D.
cicutaria, L. lancea var. lancea, and L. quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis
were not recollected.
