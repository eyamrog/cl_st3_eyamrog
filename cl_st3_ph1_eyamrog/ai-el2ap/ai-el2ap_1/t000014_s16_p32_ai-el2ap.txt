As demonstrated by the Mako case, access to language documentation
materials is often a central concern for communities, including not
only individuals directly involved in documentation efforts but also, and
sometimes to an even greater extent, their descendants (e.g., Dwyer,
2006, p. 59; Vapnarsky, 2020; R. Miller, 2021). However, the
process of returning language documentation materials to communities is frequently
complex and involves multiple stages, requiring careful consideration of the
varying capacities of community members to access these resources. These
capacities may be limited by factors such as insufficient internet
access, which restricts the ability to view or download materials
from digital repositories, as well as by the skills needed
to navigate online interfaces—particularly when these interfaces are presented in
languages such as English—and by general computer literacy. Additionally, some
community members may have limited access to static technologies such
as CD and DVD players, and may also face challenges
in reading printed materials, whether in the community language or
in other languages.
