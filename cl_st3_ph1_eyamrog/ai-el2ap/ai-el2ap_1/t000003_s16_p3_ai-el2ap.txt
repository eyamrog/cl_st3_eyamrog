Many individuals who have exercised their right to apply for
Portuguese citizenship have subsequently sought employment in countries other than
Portugal, with the United Kingdom being a notable destination. This
pattern has become more pronounced following the recent economic downturn
in Portugal. Although there are no official statistics regarding the
number of Timorese currently residing and working in the UK,
informal estimates suggest a population of approximately 15,000. Remittances sent
by these individuals to family members in Timor-Leste are substantial;
in 2008, it was estimated that remittances from the UK
to Timor-Leste totaled approximately $5 million (USD) annually (Shuaib, 2008).
Given the significant increase in migration to the UK in
recent years, it is probable that the current volume of
remittances is considerably higher (see, for example, McWilliam, 2022).
