This form of positivist coding operates under the assumption that
codes are capable of capturing specific components or characteristics of
discursive interaction. To ensure objectivity, the coding scheme was tested
for inter-rater reliability. Three master's students collaborated with the researcher
to pilot and refine the scheme, establish coding rules, and
achieve consistency in the application of codes.
