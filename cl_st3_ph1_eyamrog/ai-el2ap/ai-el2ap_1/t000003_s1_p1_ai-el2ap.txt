This paper draws on sociolinguistic and ethnographic research conducted with
young migrants from Timor-Leste residing in a small town in
Northern Ireland (Cabral & Martin-Jones, 2017). The study traced participants’
migration trajectories, which included routes via Portugal or England, and
documented the agentive strategies they employed to navigate local conditions
of settlement and employment. Simultaneously, the research examined how these
individuals established new spaces of solidarity and conviviality within the
local community. The analysis focuses specifically on the domain of
sport, particularly on the nine football clubs established for Timorese
men and boys in this Irish context. Three aspects of
the communicative practices associated with these football clubs are described
and analysed: (1) the linguistic, cultural, and semiotic practices involved
in the naming and branding of the clubs, which indexed
various Timorese regional identities as well as connections to global
football cultures; (2) the language resources of the Timorese club
managers, including their use of Tetum, Portuguese, and English, as
well as their organisational practices, ethos, and knowledge bases; and
(3) the significance of scheduling football tournaments to coincide with
key dates in the history of Timor-Leste’s nationhood, a practice
that indexed a collective orientation toward a shared national origin.
