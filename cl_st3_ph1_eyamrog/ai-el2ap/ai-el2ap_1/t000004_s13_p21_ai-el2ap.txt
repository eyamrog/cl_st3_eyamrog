Music influences both the tempo and the style of the
capoeira game. Each rhythm corresponds to a specific style of
play. For instance, the rhythm known as 'Angola' is associated
with a slow, close game in which practitioners often maintain
one hand on the ground, providing an opportunity to demonstrate
technical skill (ESPETO CAPOEIRA, 2022b). Sandro instructs his students to
identify different rhythms and understand the appropriate style of play
associated with each.
