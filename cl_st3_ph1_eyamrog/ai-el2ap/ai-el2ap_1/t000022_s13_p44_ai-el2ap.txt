Analyzing the Brazilian research system at a highly aggregated level
obscures the complexity of interactions within its boundaries. Table 5
presents data on co-authorship by the number of distinct authorsâ€™
states, categorized by the disciplinary area of the journals according
to the SciELO classification. Journals in disciplinary areas characterized by
a higher average number of authors per article, such as
Agricultural Sciences, Exact and Natural Sciences, Biological Sciences, and Multidisciplinary
fields, exhibit a higher degree of inter-state collaboration. In these
areas, the proportion of articles with authors from three or
more states exceeds 10%. Although the degree of co-authorship is
lower in the three areas associated with the Social Sciences
and Humanities, the proportion of documents involving co-authorship between two
or more Brazilian states does not fall below 29% in
any case. These findings indicate that a substantial share of
collaborative activity among authors now occurs across state boundaries rather
than solely between institutions.
