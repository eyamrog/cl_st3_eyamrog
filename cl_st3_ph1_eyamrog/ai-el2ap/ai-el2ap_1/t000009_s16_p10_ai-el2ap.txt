The participants included Brazilian computer scientists from four regions of
the country, as well as researchers who were residing abroad
at the time of the study. Given that Brazilian computer
science graduate students require proficiency in English to disseminate their
research internationally, and considering that the target audience of the
online CEAP course comprised students from across Brazil, the decision
to conduct a global investigation of the target discourse community
was aligned with these contextual factors. The diverse backgrounds of
the participants resulted in varying experiences with academic publication, which
were thoroughly examined in Phase 2 and will be discussed
in the following sections.
