By the first decade of the twenty-first century, sociolinguists had
begun to make significant contributions to this developing area of
research through both empirical studies and theoretical frameworks. Their work
advanced the understanding of the political, economic, and cultural conditions
characteristic of late modernity, as well as the ways in
which language practices and ideologies structure and legitimize these conditions
(Coupland, 2003; Heller, 2007, 2011; Blommaert, 2010; DuchÃªne & Heller,
2012; Heller et al., 2016). In this context, the present
study examines the specific epistemological shifts that have occurred within
the sociolinguistics of multilingualism and demonstrates how debates within this
field informed the conceptual framework and methodological approach adopted in
our research with Timorese communities in the UK.
