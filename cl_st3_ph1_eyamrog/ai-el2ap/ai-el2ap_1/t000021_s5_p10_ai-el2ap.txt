There are also potential drawbacks associated with altering the situation.
For instance, while strategies such as indirect modification may offer
immediate relief, they can also reinforce and sustain avoidance behaviors
over time, which may negatively affect teachers’ skill sets and
professional growth (Gross, 2015). Similarly, strategies involving the exaggeration or
simulation of emotions may demand additional effort and could adversely
impact both teaching performance and teachers’ mental health (Gross, 2015;
Taxer & Frenzel, 2015).
