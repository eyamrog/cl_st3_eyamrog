Another important factor is the required length of ONT reads.
The N50 length, defined as the length-weighted median, is a
commonly used metric for this purpose. To achieve a complete
genome assembly, the read set should have an N50 length
that exceeds the length of the longest repeat sequence in
the genome. In many bacterial genomes, the longest repeat is
typically the rRNA operon, which is approximately 5 kbp in
length and often present in multiple copies. Therefore, an ONT
read N50 of approximately 20 kbp is generally considered an
appropriate target. In rare instances where the genome contains unusually
long repeat regions, the use of ultra-long DNA extraction protocols
may be required.
