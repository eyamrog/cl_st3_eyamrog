Several theoretical models have been developed to explain emotion regulation.
Among these, the Process Model of Emotion Regulation (Gross, 1998;
Gross & Thompson, 2007) is considered particularly applicable to educational
contexts (Burić, Sorić, & Penezić, 2016). This model categorizes emotion
regulation strategies into five families that correspond to different stages
from the initiation to the expression of emotion (Gross, 2015):
(a) situation selection, which involves choosing to approach or avoid
situations likely to elicit specific emotions; (b) situation modification, which
entails altering aspects of the external environment to influence its
emotional impact; (c) attentional deployment, which consists of directing attention
toward or away from certain internal or external stimuli to
affect emotional responses; (d) cognitive change, which involves reinterpreting the
meaning of situations to modify their emotional significance; and (e)
response modulation, which refers to the direct regulation of physiological,
experiential, or behavioral responses after an emotion has been fully
generated.
