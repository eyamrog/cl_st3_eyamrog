Polypolish30 was developed with two primary objectives: first, to utilize
all-per-read alignments in order to address limitations associated with repetitive
genomic regions; and second, to adopt a highly conservative approach
that minimizes the risk of introducing errors during the polishing
process. Polypolish30 implements sequence changes only when they are unambiguously
supported by the read alignments; in cases where multiple nucleotide
possibilities exist at a given locus (for example, when some
alignments support an adenine and others support a cytosine), the
tool refrains from altering the sequence. Based on this conservative
strategy, it is recommended that Polypolish30 be applied prior to
the use of other short-read polishing tools.
