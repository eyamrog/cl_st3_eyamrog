Situating our research with Timorese migrants in Northern Ireland within
the framework of the new sociolinguistics of multilingualism, we integrate
a dual focus on the social processes of mobility and
mooring with an analysis of how language and other semiotic
resources (Kress, 2010) are utilized in the process of mooring.
Specifically, we examine the creation of spaces of solidarity and
conviviality within local lifeworlds, the construction of new identities and
forms of belonging within these spaces, and the various representations—both
online and offline—of Timorese identity that extend beyond the geographical
boundaries of Timor-Leste. We adopt the term “lifeworld” as proposed
by Habermas (1987) to denote spaces that exist outside institutional
domains. Additionally, we employ the term “spaces of conviviality” in
a broad sense, encompassing both the everyday understanding of spaces
where individuals engage in shared, enjoyable activities, and the interpretation
offered by Gilroy (2004), which refers to the potential for
conviviality in contemporary urban contexts where individuals of diverse backgrounds
coexist, differences are normalized, and cultural resources are shared or
blended across generations.
