Data from the Internet Steering Committee in Brazil (CGI.br, 2019b)
indicate that, as of 2019, 64% of Brazilian public schools
were equipped with computer labs and 57% had Internet access.
Despite these figures, access to these resources was predominantly restricted
to administrative sectors, and a significant number of computer labs
were no longer operational due to insufficient investment in technical
maintenance and qualified personnel. Consequently, in over 70% of the
schools possessing such infrastructure, students did not have access to
the available devices and Internet connectivity. Furthermore, only 34% of
public schools managed to update their equipment between 2015 and
2018 (CGI.br, 2018a, 2018b, 2019b), largely because they did not
receive consistent funding to maintain computer labs, mobile devices, or
Internet services.
