Himmelmann (2006) emphasizes the importance of archiving the primary data
generated by a research project, in addition to publishing the
analytical results, which typically comprise the Boasian trilogy of a
grammar (or sketch), dictionary, and a set of texts (Woodbury,
2003). Archiving primary data enables its reuse for further language
documentation and various types of linguistic analysis. Moreover, the archiving
of both primary and secondary data ensures that analytical outputs
are verifiable and reproducible (Himmelmann, 2006; Berez-Kroeker et al., 2018).
Storing primary and secondary data in a digital repository with
public access not only facilitates data reuse but also provides
a stable mechanism for data citation, typically through the assignment
of a persistent identifier (for recent guidance, see Conzett and
De Smedt, 2022). Persistent identifiers, such as Digital Object Identifiers
(DOIs), Handles, and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), enable proper attribution
to data creators (Berez-Kroeker et al., 2018).
