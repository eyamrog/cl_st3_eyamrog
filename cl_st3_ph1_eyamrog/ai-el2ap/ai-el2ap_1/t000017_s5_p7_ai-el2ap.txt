In the graphomotor subtest, which is similar to subtest 6
"visuoperception" in the Child Neuropsychological Maturity Questionnaire (CUMANIN) (Portellano et
al., 2000), the child is required to follow a graphic
model that involves correctly gripping the pencil with the dominant
hand, making continuous strokes, accurately following the line, drawing within
the designated space, and achieving the highest possible similarity to
the model, as well as demonstrating adequate hand-eye coordination. Validation
studies have indicated that the visuoperception subtest is a nonverbal
task and is appropriate for assessing the development of executive
functions in preschool children (Parra et al., 2016; Avila, 2012).
