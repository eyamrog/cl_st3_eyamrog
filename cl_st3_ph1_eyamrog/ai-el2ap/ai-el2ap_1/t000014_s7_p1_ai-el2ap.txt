As an increasing number of the world’s languages become endangered,
their documentation serves as a critical resource for both scholars
and communities. Documentary materials provide an empirical foundation for advancing
knowledge of linguistic diversity, serve as records of cultural and
discursive practices, and constitute tangible evidence of community heritage, thereby
enabling future generations to access the linguistic and cultural expressions
of previous generations. However, these materials are often vulnerable to
deterioration and loss; analog media such as audio and video
cassettes degrade over time, written records are susceptible to physical
damage, and even digital storage devices face risks from environmental
hazards and technological obsolescence, as demonstrated by incidents such as
the 2018 fire at Brazil’s Museu Nacional, which resulted in
the loss of numerous valuable recordings and manuscripts. Consequently, there
is a growing reliance on digital archives as essential tools
for the long-term preservation and accessibility of language documentation materials.
