Some scholars regard critical theory as a distinct third research
paradigm (Cohen et al., 2007; Guba & Lincoln, 1994; Treagust
et al., 2014). Proponents of this approach focus on the
political and ideological dimensions of human interaction, contending that elements
such as power and inequality significantly influence human behavior, social
practices, and perceptions of reality (Cohen et al., 2007).
