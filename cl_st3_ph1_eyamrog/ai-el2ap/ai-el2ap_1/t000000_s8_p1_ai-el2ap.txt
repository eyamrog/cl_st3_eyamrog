At the end of the period when plant classification systems
were primarily based on morphological data, Dennstaedtiaceae was recognized as
a large family comprising three subfamilies (or tribes) and approximately
17 genera (Tryon & Tryon 1982; Kramer 1990). With the
introduction of molecular data, these subfamilies were elevated to family
rank, and additional families were established. Currently, the early-diverging leptosporangiate
ferns are classified into Cystodiaceae (one genus), Dennstaedtiaceae in a
more restricted sense (11â€“12 genera), Lindsaeaceae (seven genera), Lonchitidaceae (one
genus), Saccolomataceae (one or two genera), and the more extensive
Pteridaceae (over 50 genera) (Smith et al. 2006; PPG I
2016; Shang et al. 2018; Schwartsburd et al. 2020).
