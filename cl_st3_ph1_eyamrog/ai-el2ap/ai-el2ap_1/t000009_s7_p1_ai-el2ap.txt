Education, understood as a dialogical social practice, constitutes a dynamic
and complex system that arises from the interaction of multiple
factors (Mason, 2008). Society, individuals, institutions, disciplinary content, and pedagogical
and psychological theories are simultaneously constituted through the interplay of
social, historical, cultural, ideological, and financial factors, all of which
both influence and are influenced by education. Consequently, educational characteristics
are specific to the contextual needs and constraints in which
they are situated, and they are continuously reorganized in response
to ongoing changes within these contexts.
