Participants arrived at varying times for Sandroâ€™s classes, with Sandro
himself frequently arriving late due to his commute from York.
Consequently, there was often a significant interval before the formal
commencement of the class. During this period, students typically greeted
each other in a friendly manner, commonly exchanging hugs and
cheek kisses. This behavior reflects the longstanding relationships among some
participants; however, newcomers were also welcomed in a similarly warm
manner. Comparable patterns of greeting were observed during workshops, where
interactions were sometimes even more enthusiastic, particularly when participants had
not seen each other for an extended period.
