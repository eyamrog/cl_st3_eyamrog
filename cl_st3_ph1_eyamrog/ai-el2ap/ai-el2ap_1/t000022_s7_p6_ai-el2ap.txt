Furthermore, thousands of journals lack document-level metadata, which limits the
ability to analyze publications in Latindex journalsâ€”a database that, as
noted by Miguel in 2011, continues to offer the most
extensive coverage. Additionally, there is no standardization of institutional affiliations
or disciplinary classifications for journals, and the adoption of unique
author and institution identifiers such as ORCID and ROR remains
insufficient across databases. These factors further constrain document-level studies, resulting
in a fragmented approach to examining the substantial body of
literature published in the region.
