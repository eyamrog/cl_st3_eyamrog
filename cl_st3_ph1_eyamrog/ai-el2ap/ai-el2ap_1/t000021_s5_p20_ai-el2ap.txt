The acting out reaction is characterized by a loss of
emotional control, such as the use of offensive language and
displays of aggression, in response to hostile behavior and threats
from students, which can elicit feelings of anger and helplessness
in teachers (Nelis et al., 2011; Chang & Devis, 2009).
Taxer and Frenzel (2015) argue that the expression of anger
in these situations is counterproductive, as it negatively affects the
teacher-student relationship. There is general agreement in the literature that
impulsive reactions are dysfunctional and may undermine the idealized image
of the teaching profession (Sutton, 2004; Sutton et al., 2009).
