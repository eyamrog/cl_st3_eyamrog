Although these platforms facilitate data sharing, none are dedicated to
the long-term digital preservation of files or data. While some
may provide content backup features, they do not guarantee sustained
preservation over time. The terms of service for these platforms
typically reserve the right to discontinue service and delete user
accounts and their associated content. Additionally, certain platforms, such as
YouTube, may retain copies of materials even after users delete
them, and content may be subject to automated downloads by
external websites, which poses significant risks for the management of
sensitive data (RICE, 2021).
