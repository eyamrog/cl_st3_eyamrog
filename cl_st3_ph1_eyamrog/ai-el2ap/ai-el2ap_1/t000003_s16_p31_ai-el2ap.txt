Some club organisers and managers integrated Timorese cultural practices and
values into the management of club funds, as exemplified by
the FC Lao Rai club. This integration was identified during
an interview with one of the club managers (Interview with
MFB, June 2015). The manager, who communicated in a mixture
of Tetum, Portuguese, and English, explained that the club addressed
the welfare of its players beyond football-related matters. For instance,
if a member required financial assistance for a return trip
to Timor-Leste, such as for attending a family funeral, the
club allocated funds to help cover the airfare. The manager
explicitly linked this practice to the Timorese cultural concept of
lia mate, lia moris, which encompasses customary obligations and rituals
(lia) associated with death (mate) and life (moris) within extended
families. These obligations are central to the social organisation of
Timorese communities both in Timor-Leste and in the diaspora, involving
the provision of material and moral support during events such
as funerals, weddings, and christenings. All members of the Lao
Rai club contributed £10 per month to support the club’s
operations. The manager also observed, in English, that football clubs
had become increasingly important for community cohesion and had achieved
a higher level of organisation in recent years (Interview with
MFB, June 5, 2015).
