The approach adopted in this study is research-driven rather than
curriculum-driven, beginning with ethnographic research into capoeira that utilizes participant
observation as well as audio and video recordings, following the
principles of linguistic ethnography (cf. Snell, Copland, & Shaw, 2015).
In addition, a translanguaging framework has been employed (Baynham &
Lee, 2018) to analyze the various communicative modalities that constitute
the capoeira spatial repertoire, including verbal, gestural, embodied, and musical
forms, and to examine their interaction at different stages of
the session. By employing a translanguaging perspective, this study recognizes
that named languages such as Portuguese or English represent only
one component among the multiple modalities integrated in capoeira practice.
Furthermore, Sandro has highlighted the presence of African elements within
each modality, including influences from languages such as Yoruba, which
further contribute to the distinctively Afro-Brazilian synthesis characteristic of capoeira.
