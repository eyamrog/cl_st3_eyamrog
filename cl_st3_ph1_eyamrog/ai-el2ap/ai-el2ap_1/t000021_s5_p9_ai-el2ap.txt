Consistent with previous research, situation modification was primarily employed to
address inappropriate behavior (Chang & Daves, 2009; Sutton, 2004; Taxer
& Gross, 2018), demotivation, and learning difficulties (Akbari et al.,
2018; Sutton, 2004; Yin, 2016). Evidence suggests that, by anticipating
potentially adverse situations, teachers engage in strategies that reduce negative
emotions in themselves (self-regulation) and in students (hetero-regulation) (BuriÄ‡ et
al., 2016; Taxer & Gross, 2018), thereby minimizing the likelihood
of unnecessary conflicts and classroom disruptions (Sutton, 2004).
