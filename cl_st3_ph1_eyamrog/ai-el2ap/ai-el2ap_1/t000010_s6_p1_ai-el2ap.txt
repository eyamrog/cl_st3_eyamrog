The present study found that the neuropsychological performance of participants
from Sancti Sp√≠ritus was significantly superior to that of participants
from Cienfuegos in tests assessing executive functions (including manual motor
skills, gestures and praxis, and verbal regulation), language abilities (such
as object and figure naming, phonemic discrimination, image vocabulary, and
numerical operations), color-naming speed, and verbal memory. In contrast, preschool
children from Cienfuegos demonstrated better performance in picture-naming speed and
visual memory. Additionally, significant differences in intellectual performance were observed
between the two groups.
