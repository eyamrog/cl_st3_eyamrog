This case study highlights three key considerations: first, it is
essential to communicate archiving processes in terms that are accessible
to both communities and individual participants; second, communities and participants
should retain the ability to revisit and potentially revise their
decisions regarding archiving; and third, while it is important to
anticipate possible future uses of archived materials and make appropriate
provisions, it must be recognized that not all future developments
can be predicted. Ethical decisions in this context are often
complex and context-dependent, and solutions effective in one setting may
not be applicable in another (Holton, 2009; Gasser, 2017). Nevertheless,
by adhering to the principles of respect, reciprocity, responsibility, and
relationships as outlined by Rice (2006), it is possible to
mitigate some of the ethical challenges associated with the archiving
process.
