Researchers have examined the contrasting characteristics of deductive and inductive
approaches to data analysis (Evans, 2013; Taber, 2013). Deductive analysis
involves seeking evidence in relation to pre-established themes, which can
influence the direction of the analysis, whereas inductive analysis is
characterized by an open-ended inquiry in which themes are generated
directly from the data and subsequently used as analytical tools
(Evans, 2013). Thus, analysis may be informed either by an
existing conceptual framework or by patterns emerging from the data
itself (Taber, 2013); however, both approaches typically involve the creation
of categories, the organization of these categories under broader headings,
and the development of a general description of the research
topic (Elo & Kyng√§s, 2008).
