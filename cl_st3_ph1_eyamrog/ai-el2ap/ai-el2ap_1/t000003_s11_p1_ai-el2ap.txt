During the final decade of the twentieth century and the
first decade of the twenty-first century, there was a marked
increase in scholarly attention to globalisation within the social sciences.
Sociological and anthropological literature from this period produced extensive theoretical
frameworks and analyses concerning the evolving social and cultural dynamics
characteristic of late modernity (e.g., Harvey, 1989; Appadurai, 1996; Castells,
2000; Hannerz, 1996). Researchers highlighted several key transformations associated with
globalisation, including the intensification of transnational migration, the rapid advancement
of communication technologies, and significant changes in the political and
economic structures of various regions worldwide.
