Sociocultural discourse analysis, as an example of a qualitative method,
is presented and applied to examine the relationships between classroom
interaction and conceptual learning. This analysis involves a detailed examination
of classroom episodes with the aim of generating analytical categories,
which are then illustrated using selected extracts. This approach allows
researchers to investigate not only specific discursive functions but also
broader forms of interaction, facilitating the development of typologies and
the evaluation of their impact on particular educational objectives. Furthermore,
this method addresses the content and function of language, as
well as the processes by which shared understanding is developed
within social contexts over time (Mercer, 2010, p. 9).
