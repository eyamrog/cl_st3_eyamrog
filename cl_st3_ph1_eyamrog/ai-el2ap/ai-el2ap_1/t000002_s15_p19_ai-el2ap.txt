Only three task pairs demonstrated significant differences (H(6) = 24.881,
p < .001): tasks 1-2 (p = .008), tasks 2-6
(p = .001), and tasks 4-6 (p = .04). As
shown in Figure 3, task 2 exhibited the highest proportion
of dialogic utterances, followed by task 4, whereas tasks 1
and 6 were characterized by a greater frequency of non-dialogic
utterances. Consequently, the hypothesis that dialogic utterances would increase across
tasks was not supported. The observed differences between tasks were
limited and do not provide evidence of an intervention effect.
