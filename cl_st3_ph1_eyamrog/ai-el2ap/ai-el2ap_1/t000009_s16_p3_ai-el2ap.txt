Once both genres circulate across various contexts—including production, legitimation, publication,
distribution, and preservation (cf. Khosrowjerdi, 2011)—the contextual TSA concentrated on
the contexts in which students actively participate, beginning with the
production and concluding with the publication of research articles. Multiple
actors, institutions, and factors are involved in these processes, such
as authors, referees, and funding agencies. Therefore, the contextual analysis
primarily aimed to understand the production and publication of research
articles in high-impact journals from the perspective of authors, who
represent the professional roles that the target students aspire to
assume in the near future.
