In Brazil, Dennstaedtiaceae is represented by eight genera and 26
species, Lindsaeaceae by one genus and 34 species, Lonchitidaceae by
one genus and one species, and Saccolomataceae by one genus
and nine species, excluding Pteridaceae, which is addressed in a
separate study (Kramer 1957; Pena et al. 2020; Schwartsburd 2020;
Schwartsburd & Pena 2020). These taxa generally exhibit plesiomorphic characteristics
typical of early-diverging lineages of Polypodiales, including solenostelic rhizomes covered
with hairs or primitive scales, large and highly dissected leaves,
sori that are truly marginal and protected by both inner
and outer indusia, and trilete spores (Tryon & Tryon 1982;
Kramer 1990; PPG I 2016; Schwartsburd et al. 2020).
