The data were further examined by assessing variations in code
frequencies across tasks (question 2) and applying statistical analyses to
identify significant differences. The dataset met the assumptions required for
non-parametric tests comparing three or more groups, as indicated by
the Fligner-Killeen test results, which were above the significance threshold
for all codes except D_EVA when comparing tasks or groups
(p > 0.05). Consequently, non-parametric methods, specifically the Kruskal-Wallis test
followed by the post-hoc Nemenyi test, were used to analyze
group comparisons. The codes labeled as ‘other’ and ‘inaudible’ were
excluded from the analysis.
