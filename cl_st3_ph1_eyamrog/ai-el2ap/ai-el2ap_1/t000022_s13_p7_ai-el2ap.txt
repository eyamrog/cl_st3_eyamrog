The introduction of Redalyc in 2005 had a notable impact
on all countries analyzed, with particularly significant effects observed in
Mexico and Colombia. Colombia exhibited consistent growth in the number
of journals over the subsequent decade, eventually surpassing Mexico, which
experienced a period of relative stagnation in journal numbers. Argentina,
Venezuela, and Cuba displayed similar patterns characterized by two distinct
periods of rapid expansion; however, the overall increase in these
countries was moderate compared to Mexico and Colombia. Specifically, Cuban
journals demonstrated an upward trend from 2005 to 2015, followed
by a subsequent decline. In Venezuela, a decrease in the
number of indexed journals began in 2009 and accelerated after
2014. In contrast, Chile presented a distinct pattern, maintaining a
steady growth trajectory without a marked change following the introduction
of Redalyc in 2005.
