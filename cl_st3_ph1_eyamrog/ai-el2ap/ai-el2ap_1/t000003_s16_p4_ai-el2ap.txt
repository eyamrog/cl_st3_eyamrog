There have been two primary, overlapping pathways into employment in
the UK for young migrants from Timor-Leste. Some individuals have
utilized established labour migration routes from mainland Portugal and Madeira,
primarily entering the rural sector. This has resulted in concentrations
of Timorese migrant workers in small towns and rural areas
of England, such as Devon and Lincolnshire, as well as
in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. In Northern Ireland, employment opportunities
have been created in food production facilities, including those specializing
in the processing and packaging of poultry and other meats
(Doyle & McAreavey, 2016). Other Timorese migrants have settled in
urban areas, including Bridgewater, Bristol, Oxford, Peterborough, Leeds, London, and
Northwich (near Manchester), where they are predominantly employed in the
service sector, such as supermarkets, department stores, and online shopping
or packing services. Regardless of their location, these migrants typically
occupy precarious positions within the local economy and are part
of what Standing (2010) describes as the “global precariat.” They
are commonly recruited through employment agencies and are required to
work flexible schedules.
