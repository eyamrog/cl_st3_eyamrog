A perfect bacterial genome assembly is defined as an assembled
sequence that is an exact, error-free representation of the organismâ€™s
genome, with each replicon fully and accurately reconstructed. Although achieving
this level of accuracy has historically been challenging, recent advances
in long-read sequencing technologies, assembly algorithms, and polishing tools have
made it increasingly attainable. In this study, we present a
recommended workflow for generating a complete and accurate bacterial genome
assembly using a combination of Oxford Nanopore Technologies long reads
and Illumina short reads. The workflow consists of Trycycler for
long-read assembly, Medaka for long-read polishing, Polypolish for short-read polishing,
and additional short-read polishing tools, supplemented by manual curation. We
also address common challenges encountered during the assembly of complex
genomes and provide an online tutorial with sample data to
facilitate the adoption of this approach (github.com/rrwick/perfect-bacterial-genome-tutorial).
