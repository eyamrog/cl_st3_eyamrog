Marianne, who is not a native speaker of Portuguese, is
nevertheless able to respond appropriately to Mestre João’s apology in
Portuguese. Throughout the demonstration, Mestre João communicates exclusively in Portuguese,
supplementing his verbal instructions with gestures and physical demonstrations, thereby
employing verbal, gestural, and embodied translanguaging. Although not all students
in the class may fully understand the verbal component, all
appear to comprehend the instructions, either by observing the demonstration
or by imitating the actions of other group members.
