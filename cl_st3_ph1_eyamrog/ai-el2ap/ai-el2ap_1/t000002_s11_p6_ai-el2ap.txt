The second paradigm is interpretivist, idiographic, and oriented toward discovery.
Within this paradigm, knowledge is regarded as an inherently subjective
human interpretation, and research focuses on specific, contextualized cases. It
addresses the meanings that participants in educational settings attribute to
their experiences (Taber, 2013, p. 52). Researchers operating within this
framework maintain that meanings are not predetermined but are co-constructed
through interaction with participants, often involving engagement in activities and
eliciting participantsâ€™ perspectives (Treagust et al., 2014). According to Guba
and Lincoln (1994), this approach is based on a relativist
ontology and a subjectivist epistemology. Relativist ontology posits that realities
are apprehended as multiple, intangible mental constructions that are socially
and experientially grounded (p. 110), while subjectivist epistemology asserts that
the investigator and the object of investigation are interactively linked,
resulting in findings that are generated during the research process
(p. 111). In this paradigm, individuals are considered agents of
their own actions and creators of their environments, leading to
its characterization as both subjectivist and voluntarist (Cohen et al.,
2007).
