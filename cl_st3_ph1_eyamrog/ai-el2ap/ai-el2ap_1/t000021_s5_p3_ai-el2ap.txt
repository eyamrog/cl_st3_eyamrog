Although the origin of these discrepancies remains unclear, it is
reasonable to consider that cultural and contextual factors influence emotion
regulation (e.g., Sutton, 2004). For instance, the studies referenced above
were conducted with elementary and high school teachers from Croatia
and the United States (e.g., Burić et al., 2016; Sutton,
2004; Taxer & Gross, 2018), with the exception of Akbari
et al. (2017), which involved Iranian foreign language teachers. In
contrast, the present study focused on teachers of vocational and
technological education in a specific region of Brazil. Furthermore, this
study expanded the range of situational factors examined, whereas previous
research primarily addressed students’ inappropriate behavior. The findings indicate that
specific situations elicit particular emotions and regulatory strategies (see Table
1). Additionally, personal factors such as area of training and
career stage also appear to influence strategy selection (Fried et
al., 2015). The following section discusses the main categories of
strategies according to their prominence in the data.
