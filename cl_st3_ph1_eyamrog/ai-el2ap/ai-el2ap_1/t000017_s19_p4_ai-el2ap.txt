Following these results, the principal component method with quartimax rotation
was applied, revealing that the nine subtests are grouped into
three factors, which together account for 62.74% of the total
variance of the test (see Table 5). Factor 1, labeled
"Executive Skills," comprises the subtests of visual selective attention, matrices,
story comprehension, graphomotor skills, and counting quantities, and accounts for
34.69% of the variance in the B-PREA-R. Factor 2, labeled
"Memory Skills," consists solely of the visual working memory subtest
and explains 15.30% of the variance. Factor 3, labeled "Linguistic
Skills," includes the vocabulary, verbal working memory, and repeating syllables
subtests, and accounts for 12.74% of the variance.
