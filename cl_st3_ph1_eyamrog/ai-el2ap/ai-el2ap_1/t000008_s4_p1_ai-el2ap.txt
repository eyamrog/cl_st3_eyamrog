This study provides important insights for research on water immersion
as a method to accelerate seed or pyrene germination and
for the ex-situ conservation of the tropical palm species Copernicia
alba Morong. The findings indicate that water imbibition is not
impeded by the presence of a thick endocarp, thereby facilitating
seed germination. Copernicia alba seeds did not exhibit dormancy and
demonstrated a high germination capacity in the control group. Pyrenes
stored for one year at 19Â°C and 45% relative humidity
experienced a reduction in water content from 10% to 7%
and a nearly 50% decrease in germination rates. Based on
these results, Copernicia alba seeds can be classified as orthodox.
Water soaking for 48 or 72 hours enhanced both the
germination rate and speed in freshly harvested and stored seeds,
whereas hot water treatments reduced germination capacity and delayed germination.
