The chamada is a coordinated movement executed by two players,
involving precise synchronization of their actions. The term literally means
'a call' and refers to a strategic, ritualized sub-game in
which one player initiates the interaction by raising their hands
as a signal. The other player responds by joining, and
both proceed to walk forwards and backwards in close proximity,
which introduces a potential risk of physical confrontation. While the
chamada may appear to be a friendly pause within the
game, its primary function is to assess the opponentâ€™s attentiveness,
and either participant may attempt to unbalance or take down
the other during this exchange.
