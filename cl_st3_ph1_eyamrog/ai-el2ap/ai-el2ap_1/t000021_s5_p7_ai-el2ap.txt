Although this family appears to be the most accessible and
adaptive, analysis of its functions and the associated interpersonal and
contextual factors indicates that it may also be linked to
reduced well-being. Furthermore, because it involves more complex regulatory components,
such as memory and verbal representations, it demands increased effort
and energy for the monitoring of cognitive processes, thereby consuming
individual resources and potentially resulting in greater exhaustion and diminished
performance (e.g., Sheppes, 2014; Yin, 2016). Overall, these findings suggest
that cognitive modification is not invariably beneficial or sufficient for
resolution, even though it remains essential for gradual adaptation.
