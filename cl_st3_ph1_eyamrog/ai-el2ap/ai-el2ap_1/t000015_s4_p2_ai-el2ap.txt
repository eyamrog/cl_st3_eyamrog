This study constitutes an initial effort to rescale scholarly communication
and leaves several important questions unresolved regarding the role of
JUOJS within the broader research landscape. Specifically, it remains unclear
how researchers published in these journals engage with and contribute
to the work of others. Further analysis of citation patterns
is necessary to understand the extent to which research published
in JUOJS interacts with both internal and external scholarly communities.
Additionally, it is important to determine whether this body of
work contributes to the increased efficiency observed in the dissemination
and utilization of research. Case studies are needed to assess
the influence of JUOJS on policy-making and professional practice. Such
investigations would support the 2030 objective established by Research4Life and
its 160 publisher partners, which aims to enhance the visibility
and support of the Global South research publishing industry (Our
vision, 2022, p. 26).
