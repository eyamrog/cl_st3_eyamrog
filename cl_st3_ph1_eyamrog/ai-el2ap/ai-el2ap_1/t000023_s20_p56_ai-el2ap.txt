The cell is approximately 1.6 times longer than it is
broad, with a deep median constriction and a linear sinus.
Semicells are pyramidal with rounded apices, and both the apical
and basal angles are broadly rounded. The cell wall is
punctate. Each cell contains a single chloroplast, with one pyrenoid
present per semicell. The cell length is approximately 36 µm,
the width is approximately 22.5 µm, and the isthmus is
approximately 8.2 µm.
