To ensure the reliability of data analysis, the coding was
compared and reviewed multiple times until the information remained consistent
and stable. Subsequently, content validity was assessed. An additional researcher
with a Ph.D. in emotional regulation independently analyzed the corpus
to validate the codes and categories, and consensus was achieved
through discussion. This process resulted in an inter-rater agreement of
97.2% among the researchers.
