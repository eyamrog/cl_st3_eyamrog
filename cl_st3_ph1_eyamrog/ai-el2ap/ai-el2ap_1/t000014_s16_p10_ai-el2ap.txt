In addition to the Goeldi Museum, few other Brazilian institutions
participate in archiving initiatives. The primary effort is currently centered
at the Museu do Índio in Rio de Janeiro, which
is part of the Fundação Nacional do Índio. Over time,
the Museu do Índio has systematically expanded its infrastructure and
developed substantial digital storage and backup capabilities. The institution has
implemented ongoing projects to document indigenous languages and cultures, adhering
to established international standards. Its digital archive comprises approximately 10
TB of linguistic documentation representing the languages of 25 indigenous
groups, as well as 9 TB of cultural documentation from
27 indigenous groups, which includes materials of linguistic relevance. The
‘Indigenous Sonorities’ project, which aims to preserve cultural heritage through
audio documentation, has produced 1.69 TB of data for five
indigenous groups. In total, the archive contains approximately 50 TB
of material. Copies of all recordings are provided to the
respective communities, although reliable Internet access for these communities remains
an unresolved issue.
