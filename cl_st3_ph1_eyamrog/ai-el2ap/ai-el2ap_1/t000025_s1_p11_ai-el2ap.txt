Systemic treatments for pain management in patients with cancer are
often ineffective in controlling pain associated with malignant fungating wounds,
primarily due to the unique etiopathogenic features of these wounds
and inadequate perfusion of superficial tissues. Furthermore, there is a
lack of clear evidence regarding the efficacy and availability of
topical interventions for pain control in this context.
