This paper does not determine the total number of journals
worldwide; however, it demonstrates that previous estimates of approximately 30,000
journals are substantial underestimations. The findings indicate that scholarly publishing
occurs on a much broader global scale than is typically
recognized in such estimates and in studies that rely on
the Web of Science Citation Index and Scopus. Dismissing this
global scale as merely excessive research activity or as evidence
of predatory publishing lacks scientific rigor. Instead, there is a
clear rationale for recalibrating scholarly communication to reflect a significantly
expanded, yet equally rigorous, landscape. Such recalibration may facilitate a
more comprehensive understanding of the ongoing growth in the research
enterprise, which extends beyond simple journal counts. This growth encompasses
considerable bibliodiversity in scholarly communication, as evidenced by research published
in 60 languages from 136 countries. It also involves shifts
in the economics of scholarly communication, including the emergence of
open source alternatives to the corporate publishing services used by
both for-profit and non-profit publishers. The open source platform examined
in this study, for example, supports an open access diamond
model that promotes equitable access for authors, users, and readers
across all academic disciplines.
