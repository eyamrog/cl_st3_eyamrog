Hot water treatments had a detrimental effect on the germination
process. The germination percentage (G%) of freshly harvested pyrenes of
C. alba decreased to 62% and 50% after 5 and
10 minutes of exposure, respectively (Figure 2a, b). These treatments
also reduced the germination percentage of stored pyrenes to 21%
for 5 minutes and 16% for 10 minutes of exposure
(Figure 2b). Furthermore, the 5-minute hot water treatment increased the
mean germination time (MGT) of freshly harvested pyrenes to 30
days (Figure 2c), while no significant effect on MGT was
observed after storage (Figure 2d). Similar negative effects of hot
water treatments on seed germination have been reported for Euterpe
oleracea Mart. (Arecaceae) from the Amazon rainforest (Bovi & Cardoso
1976). Additionally, heat shock did not break seed dormancy in
A. aculeata (Jacq.) Lodd. ex Mart. (macaw palm) and resulted
in high rates of seed deterioration (Rodrigues-Junior et al. 2016).
