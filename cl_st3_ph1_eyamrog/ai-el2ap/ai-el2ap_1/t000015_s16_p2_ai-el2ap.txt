The country of origin for each journal was determined using
a three-step process. First, the journal’s ISSN (International Standard Serial
Number) was used to query the Library of Congress (LOC)
ISSN lookup API, which returns a MARC code indicating location;
this MARC code was then mapped to a country following
the approach described by Raoni (2021). MARC codes corresponding to
subnational regions or states were manually assigned to the appropriate
countries. Second, the top-level domains of journal URLs were extracted
and mapped to their respective ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes.
Third, the IP address of each journal’s host was geolocated
using a weekly updated copy of the GeoLite2 Free Geolocation
Data.
