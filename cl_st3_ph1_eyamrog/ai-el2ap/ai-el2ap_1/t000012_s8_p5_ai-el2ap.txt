Opportunism is a central component of some ecological networks; however,
opportunistic species coexist with highly specialized species that also contribute
to network structure. Certain specialists exhibit extreme specificity by interacting
with a single partner, as observed in some gall-making insects,
floral parasites, myrmecophytes, and anemonefishes. In contrast, other specialized species
are highly connected within the network, relying on interactions with
a diverse array of partners for persistence. Examples of these
highly connected specialists include obligate nectarivorous insects, obligate frugivorous birds,
cleaner fishes, hypercarnivores, and specialized cleaning birds such as oxpeckers.
Investigating the integration of opportunistic and specialized lifestyles within ecological
networks can provide valuable insights into the ecological and evolutionary
processes that shape species-rich assemblages of interacting organisms.
