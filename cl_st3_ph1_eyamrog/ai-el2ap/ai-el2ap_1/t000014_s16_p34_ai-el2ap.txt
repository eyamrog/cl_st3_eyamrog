Ethical considerations are integral to all aspects of these initiatives,
encompassing not only the facilitation and maintenance of access to
documentary materials but also the evaluation of how and whether
community members wish to restrict access and use (see the
sections above; also MACRI and SARMENTO, 2010; DEBENPORT, 2010). Certain
recorded materials may be regarded as potentially harmful, sensitive, offensive,
or private, and determinations regarding access may involve complex and
intersecting social categories, such as distinctions between outsiders and insiders,
gender, clan affiliation, neighbor relationships, and kinship ties. These categories
often reflect a level of complexity that is not adequately
captured by the general term ‘community.’ As previously noted, decisions
regarding access, as with other aspects of documentation and archiving,
must be guided by ongoing adherence to ethical principles.
