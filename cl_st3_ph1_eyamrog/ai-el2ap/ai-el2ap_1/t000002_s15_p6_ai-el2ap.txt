Counting the occurrences of codes offers a broad overview of
the data sample and facilitates the identification of patterns both
within and across events (Snell & Lefstein, 2011). However, this
approach is associated with certain limitations, such as the tendency
to fragment the data and potentially overlook contextual information or
meanings that are not captured by the codes (Cohen et
al., 2007). As a result, systematic coding has been characterized
as reductionist (Mercer et al., 2004; Snell & Lefstein, 2011).
The following subsection presents an example of the types of
research questions and findings that can be generated through systematic
coding.
