The results of this study confirm that these facultative epiphytic
bromeliads can be successfully relocated to both soil and tree
trunks. However, survival rates following relocation differed among species, indicating
varying capacities to adapt to the physical and physiological conditions
resulting from removal from their natural habitats. These differences are
likely attributable to genetic factors influencing tolerance mechanisms to relocation.
Additionally, individual morphological characteristics, which may have contributed to the
observed survival rates, should be taken into account, especially since
both species were maintained in good phytosanitary condition in the
nursery. Lunelli et al. (2015) reported that epiphytes exhibit diverse
responses to transplantation and recommend that the biology of each
species be studied to inform and monitor relocation efforts.
