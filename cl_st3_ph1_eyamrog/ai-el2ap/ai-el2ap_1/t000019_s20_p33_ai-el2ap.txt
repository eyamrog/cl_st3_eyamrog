Access to knowledge in digital information and communication technologies (DICT)
among the general population has not progressed, as DICT remains
excluded from formal instruction in public schools due to insufficient
technological and human resources. Consequently, these schools are unable to
implement DICT education. The social groups most in need of
such instruction, specifically those in socioeconomic classes D and E,
are also the most economically disadvantaged. To acquire basic computing
skills, individuals from these groups must seek training in private
institutions, as public telecenters are inadequately equipped, as previously described.
As a result, their familiarity with digital tools is typically
limited to only the most basic functions, if any.
