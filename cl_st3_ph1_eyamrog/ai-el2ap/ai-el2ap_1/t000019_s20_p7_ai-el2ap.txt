The integration of DICT in schools is often assumed and
promoted without the support of empirical data or evidence regarding
its contextual effectiveness. As a result, DICT is regarded primarily
as an additional instructional resource, to be utilized at the
discretion of individual teachers. Furthermore, the BNCC later reiterates that
the prioritization of digital culture practices is essential, asserting that
the quality of learning is contingent upon their implementation.
