An exploratory qualitative approach was adopted due to the limited
number of studies addressing this topic within the field, and
to address certain gaps identified in the international literature. Nevertheless,
this study has several limitations that should be acknowledged, including
constraints on the generalizability of the findings and reliance on
participantsâ€™ recollections of past behaviors. Furthermore, the observed high frequency
of adaptive strategies, such as cognitive change and situation modification,
may reflect response bias associated with the "healthy worker" effect.
Additionally, the study did not account for the potential influence
of demographic variables, such as gender and age, on emotion
regulation.
