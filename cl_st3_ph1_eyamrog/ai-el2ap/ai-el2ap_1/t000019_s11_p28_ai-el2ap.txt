An omission by educators regarding the social demands introduced by
the new paradigm of the productive process is likely to
disadvantage marginalized social groups. Resistance to the widespread adoption of
new information and communication technologies in public schools, based on
the argument that these technologies are embedded in market logic
and cultural globalization, may result in increased exclusion and social
selectivity. This outcome arises from the lack of integration of
such technologies into teaching practices, which limits students' opportunities to
access and disseminate information, thereby leaving them vulnerable to cultural
and political manipulation. Consequently, it is inequitable that, in the
context of intensified information production and dissemination, a significant portion
of the population is excluded from these advancements (Lib√¢neo, 2011,
p. 61).
