The case of authors affiliated with institutions in the Northeast
region is examined in detail. Table 6 presents data on
the nine states in this region and the patterns of
collaboration between authors from these states and those from other
states and regions in Brazil. The data indicate that there
is a notable tendency for intra-state collaboration, with just over
40% of co-authored publications involving authors from the same state.
Collaboration between states within the Northeast region and with the
five most productive states—São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro,
Rio Grande do Sul, and Paraná—is distributed approximately equally. Co-authorship
with authors from the remaining thirteen states accounts for between
7.7% and 12.7% of the total. These findings suggest that
inter-state collaboration within the Northeast region occurs at a similar
rate as collaboration between Northeast states and the five principal
centers of scientific production. This pattern is further characterized by
the relatively limited participation of the other states in intra-state
collaboration.
