The cell is approximately 1.2 times longer than broad, with
a pronounced median constriction and a linear sinus that gradually
widens towards the extremity. Semicells are pyramidal with rounded to
slightly truncate apices and rounded basal angles. The cell wall
is punctate. Each cell contains two chloroplasts, with two pyrenoids
present in each semicell. Cell dimensions are as follows: length
50–61.8 µm, width 40.2–51.6 µm, and isthmus 13–20.4 µm.
