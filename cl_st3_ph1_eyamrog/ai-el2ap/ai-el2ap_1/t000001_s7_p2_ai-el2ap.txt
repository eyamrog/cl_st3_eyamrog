De novo assembly is the computational process of reconstructing a
genome from sequencing reads. Genome assembly is typically evaluated based
on two primary criteria: accuracy and completeness. Accuracy denotes the
frequency and magnitude of errors in the assembled sequences (contigs),
which may range from single-base substitutions to larger insertions or
deletions involving hundreds of bases. Completeness refers to the extent
to which the assembled contigs represent the full length of
the corresponding genomic sequences, with less fragmentation indicating higher completeness.
Ideally, each contig would correspond to an entire replicon within
the genome. A ‘perfect’ assembly is defined as one that
optimizes both accuracy and completeness; for a bacterial genome, this
would entail producing a single, error-free contig for each replicon
without any extraneous contigs.
