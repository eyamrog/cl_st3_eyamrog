Brazilian experts who had published articles in the highest-ranked journals
within each of seven computer science subfields, as identified by
the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) over a five-year period, were
invited to participate in this study. Unlike CEAP courses conducted
in English-speaking countries or in countries where English is the
language of instruction, the target context in this research is
not defined by the interactions of a local community, but
rather by a global community engaged in academic publishing in
computer science. Conducting an in-person investigation of the contextual features
of this target situation would require substantial time and resources.
Therefore, information and communication technologies (ICT) were employed as a
practical alternative for both remote data collection and analysis. Table
1 lists the ICT tools utilized in each of the
three phases of the contextual target situation analysis (TSA).
