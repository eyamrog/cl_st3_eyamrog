After the interviews were completed, they were transcribed using ELAN,
a software tool designed for audio and video transcription. The
data analysis followed the six-step content analysis methodology proposed by
Huckin (2004), which involves defining units of analysis and subsequently
tabulating the data for interpretation. Given that the transcriptions amounted
to over eight hours of recorded material, AntConc, a text
analysis software, was employed to facilitate and streamline the analysis
process.
