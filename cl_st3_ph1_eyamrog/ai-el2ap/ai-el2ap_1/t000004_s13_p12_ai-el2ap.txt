During the game, its tempo is consistently regulated by the
rhythm of the music performed by the orchestra. Individuals positioned
at the edge of the roda are responsible for sustaining
the overall energy by singing the chorus and clapping their
hands. In one observed session, the mestre reprimanded those present
for insufficient enthusiasm in their singing and clapping.
