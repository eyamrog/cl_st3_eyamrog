Researchers who have experience transferring field recordings from obsolete media
(such as cassette tapes) to newer formats, attempting to open
legacy files in updated software, or searching for compatible programs
to access outdated file types are familiar with the challenges
associated with format migration. However, when language documentation materials are
archived in a digital repository, concerns about format migration are
mitigated, as this process is incorporated into the archival workflows
managed by the repositoryâ€™s staff.
