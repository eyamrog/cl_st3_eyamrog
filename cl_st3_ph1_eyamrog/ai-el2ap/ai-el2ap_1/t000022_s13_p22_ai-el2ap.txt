The degree of international collaboration can be assessed through patterns
of co-authorship. Figure 6 presents, for six countries, the proportion
of articles authored by a single author from the country,
by multiple co-authors from the same country, and by co-authors
from the country in collaboration with researchers from other countries.
A comparison between Argentinian and Brazilian authors reveals notable differences.
Among articles authored by Argentinians, 42% are single-authored, a pattern
that is associated with the predominance of social sciences and
humanities (SSH) publications. The remaining articles are divided between those
authored exclusively by multiple Argentine researchers (48.3%) and those involving
international collaboration (9.8%). In contrast, only 14.1% of articles by
Brazilian authors are single-authored, while the majority (79.6%) involve collaboration
among researchers affiliated with Brazilian institutions, reflecting the extensive geographic
distribution of research activity within Brazil (see next section). International
collaboration remains limited among Brazilian authors publishing in journals edited
in Brazil. Thus, national collaboration is prevalent in Brazil, accompanied
by a lower incidence of single-authored publications.
