In a capoeira roda, actions occur in a prescribed sequence.
The opening song, known as the ladainha (sometimes translated as
"litany"), is performed by the leader of the roda and
serves to praise capoeira, honor past mestres, and invoke God.
During the ladainha, the other participants listen and wait before
joining in the chorus, while the two capoeiristas stand ao
pé do berimbau, often in physical contact such as holding
hands. The capoeiristas await the leader’s signal to begin the
game, which is given by the leader tilting the berimbau
slightly over their heads. When leaving the roda, capoeiristas typically
extend an arm toward each other, and the two players
often embrace before exiting through the same location at which
they entered.
