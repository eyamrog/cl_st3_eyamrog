A comparison between the forms of collaboration observed in OLIVA
and those documented in other databases reveals that international collaboration
among authors from these countries is generally higher and has
been increasing over time. SCOPUS data indicate that, in 2011,
23.9% of articles with at least one Brazilian author involved
some form of international collaboration; this proportion rose to 29.6%
in 2015 and reached 36.1% in 2020. For Argentina, the
corresponding figures for the same years were 40.4%, 42.8%, and
49.9%, respectively. It should also be noted that Brazilâ€™s overall
contribution to scientific output in the region is substantially greater
than that of other Latin American countries, with articles by
Brazilian authors accounting for 48% of all documents produced in
Latin America between 1996 and 2020, according to SCOPUS.
