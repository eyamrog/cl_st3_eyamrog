The preservation of legacy materials typically involves several key steps:
identifying the materials, assessing their physical condition, conducting preliminary organization,
transporting them to an archive or other secure location, performing
necessary conservation treatments, cataloging, and, when possible, digitizing the materials.
The process of locating legacy materials is often particularly challenging
and may depend on either incidental discovery or systematic investigation.
This task is facilitated by a comprehensive understanding of the
research history and related activities, such as exploration, within specific
regions and across various disciplines. Additionally, careful examination of methodological
sections in early publications, as well as in unpublished works
when accessible, can provide valuable information regarding the existence and
location of such materials.
