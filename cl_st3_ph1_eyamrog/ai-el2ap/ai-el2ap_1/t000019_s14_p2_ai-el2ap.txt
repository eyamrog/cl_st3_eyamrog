Cury (1986, p. 27) identifies contradiction as a fundamental category
within the dialectical method of historical materialism. According to Cury,
contradiction functions as the internal driving force of development and
represents the essential dynamics of reality. The analysis of contradictions,
whether in documentary sources or empirical phenomena, serves to elucidate
the historical and complex nature of social relations, thereby challenging
deterministic interpretations.
