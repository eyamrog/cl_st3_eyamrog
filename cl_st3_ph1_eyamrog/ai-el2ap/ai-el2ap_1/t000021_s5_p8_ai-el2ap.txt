This was the second most prominent family of emotion regulation
strategies, indicating that teachers frequently attempt to alter situations—both physical
and external—that may trigger negative emotions (Gross, 1998; Taxer &
Gross, 2018). In this study, situation modification encompassed the following
strategies: (a) direct modification, which was the most prevalent and
involved adjusting lesson plans to address specific classroom needs, such
as employing alternative resources to influence the affective tone of
the class, enhance student motivation, and facilitate learning (Akbari et
al., 2016; Sutton, 2004), as well as confronting students exhibiting
inappropriate behavior through dialogue or disciplinary actions to correct their
conduct or, if necessary, remove them from the classroom (Sutton,
2004); (b) indirect modification, which entailed requesting intervention from school
staff to address students' inappropriate behavior; and (c) faking emotion,
defined as the deliberate display of false emotions or the
amplification of genuine emotional expressions to influence student behavior, such
as exhibiting either negative or positive emotions to regulate classroom
conduct (Gross, 1998; Yin, 2016).
