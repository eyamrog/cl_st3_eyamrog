Regarding the temporal coverage of the available data, the corpus
encompasses over a century of indexed Latin American scientific production,
with documents ranging from 1909 to May 2019. The majority
of articles (84.2%) were published between 2005 and 2018. The
proportion of documents from 2019 is considerably lower (0.67%) because
data collection occurred between May and June of that year,
resulting in only partial coverage. The earliest records are from
Memórias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, which contributed 582 documents between
1909 and 1939. Subsequent early entries include Revista Chilena de
Pediatría (1940), Bragantia (1941), Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria (1943), and Anais
da Escola Superior de Agricultura Luiz de Queiroz—now Scientia Agricola
(1944). The initial appearances of journal documents from other countries
are as follows: Colombia (1969), Mexico (1974), Argentina and Cuba
(1993), Costa Rica and Peru (1995), Venezuela’s Revista de la
Facultad de Medicina (1984), Ecuador, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, and
Uruguay (2000), Bolivia (2001), and Panama (2005). The first journal
in the Social Sciences and Humanities represented in the database
is Revista de Administração de Empresas (1961), followed by Revista
Latinoamericana de Psicología (1969).
