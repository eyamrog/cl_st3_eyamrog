Digital exclusion can generally be understood in two interrelated dimensions:
lack of access to digital devices and the Internet, and
lack of digital literacy or knowledge. In both cases, digital
exclusion is closely associated with the socioeconomic status of individuals,
reflecting longstanding socioeconomic inequalities in Brazil that predate the widespread
adoption of digital technologies.
