In response to the question of what should be evaluated,
Luria asserts that the primary focus should be the defect
or symptom resulting from brain injury, as this symptom constrains
the overall functioning of mental processes and manifests as a
syndrome. Luria identified neuropsychological factors associated with various syndromes to
account for the mental processes affected by brain injury, defining
a neuropsychological factor as an element that integrates psychological systems,
human activity, and brain function. These factors form the basis
of specific actions or activities and are responsible for the
observed deficits following brain injury.
