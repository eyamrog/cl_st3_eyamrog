The presence of a motivating individual in the laboratories provided
teachers with a sense of security regarding the technical aspects
of the laboratory environment and potential complications, as well as
assistance with content development and tool selection. Ideally, the responsibilities
of this professional should have been focused on pedagogical support,
specifically in the educational application of digital information and communication
technologies (DICT), rather than replacing the role of a dedicated
technician, whose primary function is to provide technical support. Currently,
the presence of such pedagogical motivators is almost nonexistent in
public schools (Brito, 2008), and there is also a lack
of dedicated computer technicians assigned to each school.
