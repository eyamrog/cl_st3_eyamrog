The demand for language documentation archives in Brazil is increasing
and currently exceeds available capacity. One potential approach to addressing
this need is the establishment of regional digital archives, which
would not only expand capacity but also offer greater accessibility
and visibility to local indigenous communities. This increased proximity may
facilitate both the collection of additional recordings and improved access
for indigenous groups. University-based indigenous training programs, such as those
at the Universidade de Amazonas, Universidade Federal de Goiás, and
Universidade Federal do Amapá in Oiapoque, are well-suited to host
such archives. These programs provide indigenous students with computer literacy
training while maintaining connections with their communities, thereby supporting effective
collaboration between the archives and the groups involved. The necessary
infrastructure for such archives can be acquired outright or developed
incrementally alongside ongoing research or documentation projects, as demonstrated by
the Goeldi model. As of mid-2021, the cost of a
48TB Network Attached Storage (NAS) system was approximately R$20,000 (with
the exchange rate at R$5.80 per US dollar). A comprehensive
set of high-quality, portable, semi-professional equipment for digital language documentation—including
a camcorder, tripod, digital audio recorder, laptop, three types of
microphones, lamp, carrying case, batteries, cables, and adapters—also cost approximately
R$20,000, and at least two such kits would be necessary
for a regional documentation center and archive. Beyond infrastructure, effective
training in documentation technology and methodology is essential to maintain
quality standards, which remains a persistent challenge. Additionally, there is
a need for archiving software that is both straightforward and
user-friendly.
