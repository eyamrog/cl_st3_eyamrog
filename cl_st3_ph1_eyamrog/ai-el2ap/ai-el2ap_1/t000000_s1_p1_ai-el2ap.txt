As part of an ongoing project focused on the ferns
and lycophytes of the Viçosa region in Minas Gerais State,
Brazil, this study provides a taxonomic treatment of the early-diverging
lineages of leptosporangiate ferns, specifically the families Dennstaedtiaceae, Lindsaeaceae, and
Saccolomataceae. Field sampling of remnant forest patches has been conducted
since 2012, complemented by a comprehensive review of specimens housed
in the VIC herbarium and additional online collections, including F,
IAN, NY, PH, RB, U, UC, UPCB, US, and WTU.
In the Viçosa region, six taxa from these families have
been recorded: Dennstaedtia cicutaria and Pteridium esculentum subsp. arachnoideum (Dennstaedtiaceae);
Lindsaea lancea var. lancea, L. quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis, and L.
stricta var. stricta (Lindsaeaceae); and Saccoloma elegans (Saccolomataceae). Of these,
only L. quadrangularis subsp. quadrangularis and S. elegans are endemic
to the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest, while the others are widely
distributed throughout the Neotropics. This work includes identification keys, species
descriptions, illustrations, lists of examined specimens, and relevant taxonomic comments.
