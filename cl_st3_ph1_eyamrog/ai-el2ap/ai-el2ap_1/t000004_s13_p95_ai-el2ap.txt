At certain points, participants may interrupt the attack-escape dynamic by
incorporating ritualized sub-games such as the chamada or volta ao
mundo, or by introducing elements of dance or brief dramatic
performances. These instances promote playfulness and self-expression; however, even gestures
that appear harmless or friendly can function as a strategy
to disguise an impending attack. The capacity to mislead an
opponent through such deceptive behavior, known as malandragem, is a
highly valued skill in capoeira.
