Among the factors influencing the mortality of epiphyte specimens, Jasper
et al. (2005) identified the importance of secure attachment to
the host using materials that remain effective for at least
10 months. In their study, the authors employed biodegradable string,
whereas the present study utilized sisal. Given this requirement, direct
transplantation to soil may represent a viable alternative to reduce
losses of rescued specimens, particularly for facultative species (Jasper et
al. 2005). For example, specimens with facultative habits, such as
Aechmea calyculata (E. Morren) Baker, exhibited a survival rate of
79.6% when transplanted to soil. Similarly, Freitas et al. (1998)
conducted transplantation experiments to evaluate the epiphytic growth of terricolous
ramets of Nidularium procerum Lindman and Nidularium innocentii Lemaire, both
considered facultative epiphytes, and reported 100% survival of all ramets
after two years.
