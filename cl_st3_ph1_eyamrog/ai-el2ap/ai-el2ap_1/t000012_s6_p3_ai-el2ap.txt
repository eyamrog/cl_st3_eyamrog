These individuals utilize resources available within the network, such as
arthropods, injured tissue, or blood, rather than relying on specific
hosts. Species with a high number of connections within the
network are referred to as supergeneralists (Jordano et al. 2003;
Thompson 2005). These species exhibit highly specialized lifestyles that are
dependent on the structure and dynamics of the network for
their survival. The presence of supergeneralists in a community is
associated with a relatively greater contribution to the maintenance of
community structure and function compared to other species. The occurrence
of dietary specialization in central species is not exclusive to
cleaning networks, as similar patterns are observed in other types
of supergeneralists. For instance, in seed-dispersal networks, species with higher
centrality degrees also tend to exhibit dietary specialization, and centrality
has been shown to be best explained by dietary specialization
(Mello et al. 2014).
