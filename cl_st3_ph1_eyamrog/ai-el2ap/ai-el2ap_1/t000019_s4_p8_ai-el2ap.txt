In addition to improving school environments, it is essential for
the government to ensure equitable access to computers and reliable
internet connectivity, as students are increasingly required to complete assignments
and participate in collaborative projects outside of school that depend
on online resources. Without such measures, there is a risk
that traditional correspondence education will simply be replaced by its
digital equivalent, without addressing underlying issues of educational quality and
accessibility.
