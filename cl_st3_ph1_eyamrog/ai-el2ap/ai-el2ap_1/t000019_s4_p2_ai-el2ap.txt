Given that these challenges existed prior to the pandemic, they
help to explain the significant difficulties encountered by school staff,
parents, and students in rapidly adapting to emergency remote education.
Therefore, before promoting or implementing various models of distance education,
it is essential that public authorities take responsibility for the
regular renewal and maintenance of adequate technological infrastructure in schools,
as well as for targeted teacher training. As Brenda et
al. (2018, p. 5) observe, “the state has retreated from
the social commons, only appearing to aid the grip of
privatization and speculation.” Public authorities should also develop initiatives to
support increased access to information technology in households with students.
Including such measures in the national curriculum is insufficient; the
state must ensure that the population has the necessary resources
to participate effectively in distance education.
