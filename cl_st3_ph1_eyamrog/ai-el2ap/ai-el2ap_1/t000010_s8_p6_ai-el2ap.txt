The results presented align with the framework proposed by Ardila
(1995), who recommends examining neuropsychology and its relationship with culture
and education through six analytical units: (1) the standardization of
neuropsychological instruments should account for the cultural and educational characteristics
of the target population, as well as the cultural context
in which standardization occurs; (2) the development and validation of
neuropsychological tests should be tailored to specific cultural contexts; (3)
educational factors and subcultural variations should be analyzed in relation
to test performance; (4) cognitive disorders associated with brain pathology
should be examined across different cultural and educational contexts; (5)
commonalities in neuropsychological performance among various human groups should be
identified; and (6) the origins of cognitive activity should be
analyzed.
