Nearly two decades have passed since the integration of information
and communication technology (ICT) into education. Over this period, the
exchange of experiences among teachers, researchers, and institutions facilitated by
ICT has contributed to the reorganization and enhancement of educational
practices. Recent studies in the literature highlight the expanded opportunities
introduced by the digital era. In the context of language
teaching and learning, ICT has played a significant role in
modernizing traditional pedagogical approaches and practices (see Eckhaus, 2018) and
in supporting the development of new instructional tools and materials
(see Sahraini & Syamsudarni, 2018). The field of English for
Specific Purposes (ESP) has also benefited from ICT, primarily in
two ways: by transforming conventional language learning methods through the
introduction of new tools, and by enabling new forms of
communication that allow students to interact with their discourse communities
during instruction (Bloch, 2012). However, the application of ICT in
needs analysis, particularly with respect to the target situation, has
received comparatively less attention. In examining studentsâ€™ future communicative needs,
technology has predominantly been employed to investigate linguistic (Ha &
Hyland, 2017) and textual (Supatranont, 2012) features of specialized discourse.
This paper aims to demonstrate the advantages of utilizing ICT
to examine contextual features of language use in the target
situation.
