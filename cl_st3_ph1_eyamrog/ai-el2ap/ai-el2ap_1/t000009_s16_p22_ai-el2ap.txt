In addition to enabling the researcher to reach participants located
in various regions of Brazil and abroad, conducting the interviews
online provided participants with the flexibility to choose the most
convenient time and place for their participation. The use of
information and communication technologies (ICT) in the contextual TSA thus
facilitated not only the specificity required by Needs Analysis, as
discussed in the previous subsection, but also supported the critical
perspective advocated by CEAP pedagogy. Interviewing members of a global
community allowed the teacher-researcher to observe and identify beliefs, behaviors,
access levels, restrictions, and power relations that may be perpetuated
by the diverse backgrounds of researchers in the field. Figure

for academic writing, their international academic experience, and their perceptions
of the influence of contextual factors on the acceptance of
papers by Brazilian computer scientists in high-impact journals within the
field.
