Although English maintains a dominant position as the primary language
of research among JUOJS, 48.3% of these journals publish content
in more than one language (Figure 7). The distribution of
the four leading languages can be observed across both monolingual
and multilingual journals (Figure 8). Monolingual English-language journals constitute the
largest group, comprising 6,651 titles (represented by a single dot
under the first column). However, significant bibliodiversity is evident in
the subsequent categories, with Indonesian-English bilingual journals accounting for 4,431
titles and Portuguese-Spanish-English trilingual journals comprising 550 titles. It should
be noted that the prevalence of English may be overestimated,
as language analysis is often based on titles and abstracts,
which are frequently translated into English from other languages. Additionally,
some articles incorporate multiple languages within their text, such as
combinations of Spanish and Castilian or Bahasa Indonesia and Javanese.
