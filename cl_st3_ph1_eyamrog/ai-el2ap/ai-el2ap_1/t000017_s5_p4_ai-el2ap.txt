Doebel (2020), referencing the analysis by Miyake et al. (2000),
identifies three core components of executive functions: inhibitory control, working
memory, and cognitive flexibility, which serve as the foundation for
higher-order executive functions such as planning and problem solving (Zelazo,
2020). Based on this classification, the visual selective attention subtest
is most clearly associated with these basic executive functions. In
contrast, the matrices, story comprehension, graphomotor skills, and counting quantities
subtests share a reliance on planning and problem solving, both
of which inherently involve cognitive flexibility and working memory.
