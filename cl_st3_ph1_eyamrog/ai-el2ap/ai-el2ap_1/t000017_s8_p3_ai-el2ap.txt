The sociocultural approach provides a significant theoretical framework for assessing
and promoting the development of preschool children within educational settings,
and this framework is further enhanced by cognitive neuropsychology, which
examines the relationships between brain maturation and behavioral development in
children. A review of the literature indicates a trend among
researchers to develop and adapt cognitive assessments for preschool children
using an integrated approach that combines the principles of cognitive
neuropsychology with the foundational concepts of the sociocultural approach (Piedra
et al., 2021).
