However, there are limitations in the current understanding of how
to implement this approach in educational practice. Specifically, educators often
divide the assessment of holistic development into separate developmental domains,
which restricts their focus to specific content areas and overlooks
the integrated nature of development. For instance, during motor skills
or physical education activities, assessment typically centers on the motor
dimension, while other competencies—such as the child's ability to identify
objects by name, size, and color, their communication with educators
and peers, and their demonstration of values during the activity—are
frequently neglected.
