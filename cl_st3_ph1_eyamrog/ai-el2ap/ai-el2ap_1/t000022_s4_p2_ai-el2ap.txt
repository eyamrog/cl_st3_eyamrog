The corpus of documents analyzed in this study was constructed
from a database that integrates information from two major indexers
of Latin American and Caribbean scientific journals: SciELO and Redalyc.
This integration, facilitated by the collaborative efforts of both institutions
and CLACSO, enables a comprehensive examination of the sustained contributions
made by these open access publishing platforms. The analysis highlights
the existence of a substantial body of Latin American scientific
output that meets high quality standards, yet remains underrepresented in
prevailing academic assessment frameworks. A key finding is the notable
longevity and diversity of the journals included, with some titles
originating in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Additionally,
the corpus encompasses a wide range of disciplinary fields, collaboration
patterns, publication languages, authorship types, geographic affiliations of authors, and
publishing institutions, reflecting more than a century of scientific production
in the region.
