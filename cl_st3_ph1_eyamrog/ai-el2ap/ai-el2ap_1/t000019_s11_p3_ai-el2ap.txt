Another prevalent conception of technology, often linked to postmodernist perspectives,
is technological determinism. This view characterizes technology not only as
a neutral entity but also as a force that exerts
control over humans, shaping society according to the imperatives of
efficiency and progress (Feenberg, 2003, p. 7). Within this framework,
there is a tendency to assert that technologies can resolve
a wide range of problems, frequently without adequate consideration of
their socio-historical contexts.
