Infrastructure improvements were achieved through the acquisition of high-quality cassette
tape recorders, microphones, laptops, and solar equipment via research projects.
In 1996, the World Bank’s Centers of Excellence program provided
Digital Audio Tape (DAT) players, Hi-8 video recorders, a Hi-8
editing suite, and professional storage cabinets. Building on this foundation,
Goeldi linguists, including both fellows and affiliates, successfully secured funding
from international documentation programs that prioritize projects in developing countries.
In the early 2000s, additional equipment and expertise were obtained
through projects funded by the Endangered Languages Documentation Programme (ELDP)
and the Dokumentation Bedrohter Sprachen program (DOBES). The process of
documentation and equipment procurement, such as the acquisition of solid-state
recorders with flash memory, continued into the latter half of
the decade with support from USAID, UNESCO, and the Ambassador’s
Fund (US Embassy). In 2007, the Ministry of Science, Technology
and Innovation (MCTI) supplied further equipment, including a server to
establish a digital repository. Documentation and research projects persisted in
the second half of the 2000s with continued support from
CNPq, DOBES, and ELDP. In 2007, these advancements faced significant
opposition from a small group of linguists who criticized the
ProDocLin Museum's linguistic documentation program, as well as international documentation
initiatives and digital archives (Moore and Galucio, 2016, p. 40).
However, this opposition did not gain traction among Brazilian linguists,
and progress continued at both the Goeldi Museum and nationally.
