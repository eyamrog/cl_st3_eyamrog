Two local employment agencies serve as the primary intermediaries for
individuals seeking employment. While Timorese migrants who arrived in the
initial groups were able to secure employment immediately and had
their travel expenses from Portugal covered (Interview with RS and
HA, June 2015), more recent arrivals typically experience a waiting
period of approximately 5 to 8 months before obtaining full-time
positions. There has also been a notable increase in the
casualization of employment, resulting in newcomers initially being offered part-time
work on an irregular basis. One interviewee described the insecurity
and anxiety experienced by himself and his colleagues over an
eight-month period due to the precarious nature of their employment,
stating, “Ne’ebé telefone ami tau deit iha ulun leten …kualkér
tempu deit [sira] liga ona” (We slept with our phones
above our heads …they could call us at any time)
(Interview with CX, June 2015). For those Timorese who do
obtain full-time positions, the working hours are extensive, with twelve-hour
shifts and no additional compensation for overtime, as the work
schedule alternates weekly between five days one week and two
days the following week.
