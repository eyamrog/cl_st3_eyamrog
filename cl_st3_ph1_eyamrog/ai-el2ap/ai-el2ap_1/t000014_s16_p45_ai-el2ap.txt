Legacy materials can be utilized on an ongoing basis, and
their use necessitates interpretation—a process that involves understanding the original
intentions of the creators, considering the potential for new meanings
in contemporary contexts, and recognizing the roles that current users
may play in the materials’ circulation and reception (Dobrin and
Schwartz, 2021, p. 23). A notable example of sustained engagement
with legacy materials is the biennial Breath of Life Archival
Institute for Indigenous California Languages (see Gehr, 2013), held at
the University of California, Berkeley. This event is organized by
the Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival (AICLS) in collaboration
with the Survey of California and Other Indian Languages, which
manages the California Language Archive. The Institute facilitates collaboration between
Indigenous participants and volunteer linguists in the interpretation of archival
materials, many of which originate from the early twentieth century.
This model has been successfully implemented in other regions (Baldwin,
Pérez Báez, and Hinton, 2018), and it may be worthwhile
to consider whether a similar initiative in Brazil could enhance
the accessibility of existing language materials.
