Differences in teachers' emotion regulation were identified based on their
area of training or teaching and their career stage. Teachers
in the basic education area, particularly those with more experience,
demonstrated a greater frequency and variety of emotion regulation strategies,
consistent with findings by Sutton et al. (2009) and BuriÄ‡
et al. (2016), which indicate that more experienced teachers are
generally more effective in regulating their emotions. While strategies related
to situation modification and cognitive change were prevalent across all
groups, there were nuanced differences in the specific strategies employed.
Teachers in the basic education area were more likely to
use strategies aimed at approaching and coping with emotional demands,
whereas those in technical education were more inclined to use
avoidance strategies. These distinctions were more pronounced when comparing beginner
and non-beginner teachers, suggesting that length of career amplifies these
tendencies. Specifically, non-beginner teachers in the basic area appeared to
encounter more emotional demands and exhibited greater variability in their
regulation strategies compared to beginners, whereas in technical education, increased
experience was associated with a stronger tendency toward avoidance strategies.
