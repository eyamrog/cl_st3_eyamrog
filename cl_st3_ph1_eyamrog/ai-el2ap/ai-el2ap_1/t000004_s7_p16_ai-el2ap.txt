Upon relocating to the countryside, his new elderly mestre continues
to instruct him in the street-fighting techniques of capoeira while
also providing comprehensive exposure to the art form’s history, cultural
context, songs, narratives, key figures, and African influences. This cultural
and historical dimension is integral to his development and practice
as a contramestre. During his introductory sessions in Leeds, he
systematically explains in English the historical significance and deeper meanings
of traditional songs and stories, such as the “snake story”
discussed below. Notably, he does not promote a simplistic association
between learning Portuguese and practicing capoeira. Instead, Sandro conceptualizes capoeira
as a multilingual practice, shaped by influences from Yoruba, Crioulo,
and other languages in addition to Portuguese. In this respect,
his approach aligns with the translanguaging perspective adopted in this
study.
