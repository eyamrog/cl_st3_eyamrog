In conclusion, this scheme enabled the systematic description of classroom
talk and the evaluation of dialogicity, both of which were
central to the research questions. Classroom talk was characterized by
comparing the relative frequencies of coded utterances across different contexts
(content, instruction, off-topic), while dialogicity was assessed by analyzing the
proportion of dialogic utterances relative to simple utterances.
