Teachers employ a wide range of emotion regulation strategies primarily
to prevent or mitigate negative emotions before, during, and after
class. These findings are consistent with those reported by Burić
et al. (2016) and Taxer and Gross (2018). The strategies
identified in this study were effectively categorized according to the
five families of the Process Model of Emotion Regulation, indicating
that this model is applicable to the classroom context and
aligns with previous research (e.g., Akbari et al., 2017; Burić
et al., 2016; Sutton, 2004; Taxer & Gross, 2018). Among
these, the families of cognitive change and situation modification emerged
as the most prominent, corroborating the results of Burić et
al. (2016), while Sutton (2004) also reported a high prevalence
of cognitive change. In contrast, Taxer and Gross (2018) found
that teachers more frequently utilize response modulation strategies, such as
suppression, and Akbari et al. (2017) emphasized the use of
situation selection. These varying results highlight ongoing disagreements in the
literature regarding the specific emotion regulation strategies teachers employ in
classroom settings.
