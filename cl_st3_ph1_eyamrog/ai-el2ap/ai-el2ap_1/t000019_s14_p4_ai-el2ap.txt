Documents convey statements about the world that aim to provide
specific representations of reality and propose idealized solutions to identified
problems. It is important to recognize that any discourse, by
prioritizing certain objects and concepts, necessarily excludes others. This selective
emphasis can result in a discourse that supports the interests
of dominant groups, raising questions about whether the resulting benefits
extend to individuals outside these groups (Ball, 1994, as cited
in Shiroma et al., 2005, p. 439).
