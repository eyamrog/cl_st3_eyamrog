The cognitive change family emerged as the most prominent, indicating
that teachers frequently reinterpret events or their own capacity to
manage them in order to mitigate the effects of adverse
circumstances and reduce emotional labor (Akbari et al., 2016; Burić
et al., 2016; Taxer & Gross, 2018). Cognitive change encompasses
several strategies (Mallory & Rupp, 2016). For example, teachers may
attempt to positively reinterpret undesirable situations, such as student demotivation
or inappropriate behavior, by focusing on students’ efforts to improve
academically (Sutton, 2004; Yin, 2016). Additionally, teachers may attribute challenges
to external factors, such as socioeconomic or cultural context, the
educational system, or student characteristics like personality and age, thereby
externalizing causality (Burić et al., 2016). Teachers may also seek
to understand and accept situations by adopting others’ perspectives (Akbari
et al., 2016; Clarà, 2017; Taxer & Gross, 2018). Other
forms of cognitive change include personalization, adjustment of expectations, rationalization,
and self-blame (see Table 2).
