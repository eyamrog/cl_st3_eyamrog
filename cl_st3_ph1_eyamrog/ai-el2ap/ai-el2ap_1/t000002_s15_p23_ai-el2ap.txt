Researchers who work with discursive data and qualitative methods utilize
a range of procedures, including the identification of themes, the
generation and classification of analytical units, the categorization of these
units, the structuring of narratives to describe content, the interpretation
of scenarios, and the construction of theoretical frameworks (Cohen et
al., 2007; Robson, 2002).
