The construction of this integrated database encountered several significant limitations.
The primary limitation was the absence of a unified identification
system for authors, journals, and institutional affiliations across the indexing
platforms. Additionally, information on gender was unavailable, which is typical
for scientific documents and bibliographic records. Another notable challenge was
the compilation of the various segments of indexed published documents
from journals included in both indexing services.
