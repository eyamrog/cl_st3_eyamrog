The secondary data generated in these projects include annotations and
metadata associated with the recordings. Annotations, comprising transcriptions and translations
into Portuguese, were produced using the ELAN program (EUDICO Linguistic
Annotator 2020) and Microsoft Word. Lexicons for both languages were
developed, and several Paresi texts were interlinearized using the FLEx
program (FieldWorks Language Explorer 2019) in accordance with the analysis
presented in the reference grammar. The transcriptions and translations of
the texts were carried out by the speakers. Most transcriptions
were produced during periods when the lead researcher was not
present in the communities; in the case of Paresi, these
transcriptions were subsequently reviewed with the speakers. Paresi speakers received
training in the use of ELAN, whereas EN speakers had
limited interaction with this program and preferred to transcribe using
Word on a computer or mobile device. The notes from
the EN recordings are still being organized, and all material
will be transferred to ELAN to facilitate future publication in
a digital collection.
