By analyzing 25,671 journals that are largely absent from commonly
used journal indexes, including Web of Science and Scopus, this
study provides evidence that scholarly communication is more globally distributed
than is often recognized. These journals, which utilize the open
source publishing platform Open Journal Systems (OJS), have collectively published
5.8 million items and are based in 136 countries, with
79.9% located in the Global South and 84.2% operating under
the OA diamond model (charging neither readers nor authors). A
significant proportion of these journals publish in more than one
language (48.3%), and research is disseminated in a total of
60 languages, with English, Indonesian, Spanish, and Portuguese being the
most prevalent. The disciplinary distribution includes the social sciences (45.9%),
STEM fields (40.3%), and the humanities (13.8%). Despite their geographic,
linguistic, and disciplinary diversity, only 1.2% of these journals are
indexed in Web of Science and 5.7% in Scopus, while
1.0% are listed in Cabells Predatory Reports and 1.4% appear
on Beallâ€™s list of questionable journals. This study aims to
document and contextualize the expanded scale and diversity of scholarly
publishing, with the objective of informing a more comprehensive understanding
of the global research landscape.
