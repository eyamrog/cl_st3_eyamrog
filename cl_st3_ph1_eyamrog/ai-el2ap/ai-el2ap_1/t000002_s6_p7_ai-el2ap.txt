This study adopts a complementary approach within the analytical-empirical dimension,
as the nature of the research questions in educational studies
often necessitates the use of both quantitative and qualitative methods
(Souza & Kerbauy, 2017). Employing a mixed-methods methodology (Tashakkori &
Teddlie, 1998) enables the integration of diverse analytical frameworks to
address research questions in a comprehensive and coherent manner. Consequently,
exploratory research questions are best addressed through qualitative analysis, whereas
questions with a confirmatory focus are more appropriately examined using
quantitative characterizations and comparisons.
