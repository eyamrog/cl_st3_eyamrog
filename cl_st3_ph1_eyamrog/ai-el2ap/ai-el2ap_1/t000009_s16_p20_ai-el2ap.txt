Part 2 consisted of a standard semi-structured interview. Participants were
presented with data derived from the analyzed questionnaire concerning contextual
factors—including sexism, xenophobia, and social and academic bias—that, according to
the 38 respondents, may influence the publication of papers, as
well as information regarding the profile of Brazilian computer scientists
who have published in refereed journals. Subsequently, participants were asked
to interpret these findings (cf. Vieira, 2019b).
