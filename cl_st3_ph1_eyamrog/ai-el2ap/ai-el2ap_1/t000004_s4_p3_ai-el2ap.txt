A potential implication of our study is the development of
strategies to enhance language learning opportunities within capoeira by incorporating
pedagogical approaches that render these opportunities more systematic and accessible.
The transition from initial language exposure to successful language acquisition
is often facilitated by individual initiative, with learners seeking out
additional resources. Various materials are available to support this process,
such as "Portuguese for Capoeiristas" (Whyatt, Barberis, & Paschoal, 2020),
which offers instruction in essential vocabulary, verbs, phrases, and grammar
through 16 lessons centered on popular capoeira songs, and is
accessible both online and in print. However, from our perspective,
Capoeira as an Additional Language encompasses not only the acquisition
of Portuguese—specifically, an Afro-Brazilian variety—but also the embodied practice of
capoeira itself, of which language is a crucial, though not
exclusive, component.
