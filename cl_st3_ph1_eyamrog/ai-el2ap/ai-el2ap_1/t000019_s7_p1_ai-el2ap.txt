The widespread integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) across
various professional sectors, recreational activities, and public services has increased
the demand for computer literacy among both professionals and the
general population. This requirement for technical competence is not limited
to individuals working within the field of Informatics. For instance,
lacking an email account or the ability to use it
may restrict access to numerous public services. This example represents
only a basic level of necessity, as the need for
IT knowledge among citizens extends significantly beyond the requirements for
effective social participation.
