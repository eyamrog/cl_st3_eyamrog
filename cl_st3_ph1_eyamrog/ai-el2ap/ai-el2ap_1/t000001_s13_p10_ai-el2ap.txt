This step is designed to correct as many remaining errors
as possible using only long-read sequencing data. Medaka is recommended
for this purpose, as it has been observed to yield
more accurate results than Nanopolish. Medaka employs a neural network
and provides pre-trained models tailored to specific combinations of Oxford
Nanopore Technologies (ONT) chemistry and basecaller versions; therefore, it is
important to select the Medaka model that most closely matches
the characteristics of the ONT reads being used. Alternatively, long-read
variant callers such as Clair3 can be utilized as polishers
by applying the identified variants directly to the assembly.
