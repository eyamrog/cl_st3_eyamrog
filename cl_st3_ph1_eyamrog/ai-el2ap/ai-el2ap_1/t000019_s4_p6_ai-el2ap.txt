Investments in technological infrastructure in schools, incentives for students to
acquire equipment and internet access, and teacher training in the
use of ICT are not commensurate with the frequent emphasis
on the adoption of ICT and hybrid teaching methods in
Brazil. While the government allocates resources toward the digitalization of
public services, it does not provide sufficient investment in infrastructure
or in the development and dissemination of digital literacy among
the population, which are necessary for effective participation in these
services. Government investment tends to prioritize digitalization initiatives that are
expected to reduce public expenditure, rather than addressing the needs
of the population for access and capacity building.
