The transition from the initial stage of language learning, which
is characterized by repetition of words and phrases and passive
knowledge, to a subsequent stage that requires more active language
production can be challenging. Observations indicate that this progression often
necessitates additional language learning outside the capoeira context. For example,
Sophie demonstrates advanced language acquisition achieved through a combination of
learning from songs (capoeira and Brazilian music), listening to conversations
among native speakers of Brazilian Portuguese, and employing formal language
learning strategies such as using textbooks. Additional contributing factors include
her enthusiasm for capoeira and the Portuguese language, as well
as her prior knowledge of other Romance languages, given that
she is a native French speaker and has studied Spanish.
Marianne, on the other hand, exhibits communicative competence in Portuguese,
applying the language appropriately beyond the context of songs or
isolated vocabulary. Thus, capoeira classes serve as an entry point
for learning Portuguese, while the practice of capoeira itself provides
significant motivation for learners to further develop their language proficiency,
as advanced practitioners are expected to communicate at a higher
level.
