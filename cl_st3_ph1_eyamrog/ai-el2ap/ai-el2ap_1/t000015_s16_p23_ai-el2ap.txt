The relevance of this analysis to the present study lies
in the recent and frequent claims that “predatory journals are
a global threat” (Oviedo-García, 2021; Bagat, 2021; Shrestha, Timsina, &
Subedi, 2021; Grudniewicz et al., 2019; Strong, 2019), as well
as in the tendency of some articles to conflate predatory
publishing with open access (OA) publishing (Krawczyk & Kulczycki, 2021).
This study maintains a clear opposition to deceptive and dishonest
journals, regardless of their geographic location. However, the characterization of
predatory journals as a global research threat may reinforce existing
global inequalities in scholarly publishing, as previously noted by Cetto
(1997), without effectively addressing the underlying issues. A potentially more
constructive and less detrimental approach to global science would involve
establishing publishing standards that promote transparency in journal integrity, an
area in which preliminary tests have already been initiated (Willinsky,
2022).
