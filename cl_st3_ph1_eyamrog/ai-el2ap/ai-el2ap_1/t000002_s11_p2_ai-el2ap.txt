Crotty (1998) posits that the conceptualisation of research should comprise
four key elements: epistemology, theoretical perspective, methodology, and methods. Similarly,
Taber (2013) identifies comparable components when discussing ontological and epistemological
assumptions in research, specifically highlighting theoretical perspective, methodology, research design,
and the systematic application of techniques for data collection and
analysis.
