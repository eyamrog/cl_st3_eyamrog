The material was observed in both lentic and lotic systems,
across a range of trophic states from oligotrophic to supertrophic,
as well as under both acidic and alkaline conditions. Delazari-Barroso
et al. (2007) previously reported its presence in the phytoplankton
of a small water supply reservoir in Esp√≠rito Santo State.
