This paper is based on sociolinguistic ethnographic research conducted with
young migrant workers from Timor-Leste residing in a small town
in Northern Ireland (Cabral & Martin-Jones, 2017). The primary objectives
of the study were: (1) to construct detailed accounts of
the life histories of a small sample of these young
Timorese individuals, considering their educational backgrounds, previous work experience in
Timor-Leste, and their migration trajectories from Timor-Leste to Northern Ireland,
including transit through Portugal or England; (2) to document their
strategies for adapting to local conditions of settlement and employment;
(3) to examine the agentive practices through which they established
new spaces of solidarity and social interaction within the local
community; and (4) to analyze how they utilized various linguistic,
cultural, and semiotic resources—including Portuguese—in the process of constructing new
transnational and transcultural identities within the local context.
