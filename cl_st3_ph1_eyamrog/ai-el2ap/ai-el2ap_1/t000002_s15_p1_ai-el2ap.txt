Analyzing discursive interaction is a process that involves constructing meaning
from the expressions and perspectives of participants, which are influenced
by social, cultural, and situational contexts. This analytical process is
inherently interpretive and is closely linked to reflexivity, as researchers
inevitably introduce their own preconceptions, interests, biases, and agendas into
the analysis (Cohen et al., 2007).
