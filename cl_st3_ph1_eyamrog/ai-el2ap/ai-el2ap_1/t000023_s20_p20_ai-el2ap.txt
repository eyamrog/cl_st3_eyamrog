The cell is approximately 1.8 times longer than it is
broad, with a deep median constriction; the sinus is closed
near the isthmus and open at the extremity. Semicells are
quadrate, with rounded apical and basal angles and a truncate
apex that exhibits a central refractive thickening. The cell wall
is smooth and features three horizontal rows of punctations on
each semicell. Each cell contains a single chloroplast, with one
pyrenoid per semicell. Cell dimensions are as follows: length 19.4–30.7
µm, width 10.8–17.9 µm, and isthmus width 3.5–3.7 µm.
