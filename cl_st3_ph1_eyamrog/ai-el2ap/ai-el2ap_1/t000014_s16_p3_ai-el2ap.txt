The Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi is a research institute affiliated
with the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI) and
is located in Belém, Pará. The institute specializes in research
on the Amazon region. The Linguistics Area, which is part
of the Human Sciences Division, has experienced significant challenges in
its development. In 1986, the Linguistics Area lacked essential resources,
such as audio recorders, computers, and an adequate collection of
books. Consistent with broader national trends, there was minimal investment
in research infrastructure. Despite these limitations, the Goeldi maintained a
strong tradition of scientific collections, which provided a suitable context
for language documentation activities. The involvement of interns, fellows, and
visiting researchers contributed to a gradual increase in research and
documentation activities within the Linguistics Area.
