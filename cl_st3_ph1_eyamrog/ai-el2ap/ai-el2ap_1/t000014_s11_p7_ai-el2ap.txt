Numerous institutions worldwide have committed to maintaining digital archives, contributing
significantly to the preservation of language documentation data. The Digital
Endangered Languages and Musics Archives Network (DELAMAN, https://www.delaman.org/) is a
consortium of member archives specializing in such data. These archives
vary in scope and format; some are exclusively digital, while
others also maintain physical collections. Certain archives focus on specific
geographic regions, such as the Archive of the Indigenous Languages
of Latin America (AILLA), whereas others, like the California Language
Archive (CLA), accept materials from any location. Additionally, some archives
restrict submissions to data associated with particular grants or funding
sources, as is the case with the Endangered Languages Archive
(ELAR), which primarily accepts materials collected through the Endangered Languages
Documentation Programme. Others, such as the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe
Language and Culture Institute, focus on materials pertaining to specific
languages. In response to increased awareness of language endangerment, several
Latin American institutions, including those in Brazil, have established local
language archives; Seifart et al. (2008) provide a detailed account
of the initial development of these efforts. However, many of
these archives have not remained operational over time. Notably, two
repositories in Brazil have continued to function and are discussed
in §3. Furthermore, new archives have been established in recent
years, such as the Archivo de Lenguas, Culturas y Memorias
Históricas del Ecuador, which is institutionally supported by FLACSO Ecuador
(http://languages.flacso.edu.ec/).
