In the latter half of the twentieth century, the limited
number of migrants arriving in Northern Ireland predominantly settled in
major urban centers such as Belfast, rather than in smaller
towns like those examined in this study. Consequently, the local
populations of towns such as Dungannon and Cookstown had minimal
prior exposure to newcomers. However, the first two decades of
the twenty-first century saw a marked increase in labour migration
to these towns. Analysis of the 2011 Census data by
Doyle and McAreavey (2016, p. 59) indicates that, by 2011,
there was a notable concentration of migrants from diverse backgrounds
in specific wards of Dungannon, with four wards exhibiting migrant
populations exceeding 20% and two wards exceeding 30%, representing a
substantial demographic shift within a decade. As a result of
these changes, Timorese participants in this study who arrived in
Dungannon during the early twenty-first century reported experiencing significant hostility
from local residents and frequent exposure to racist language. Additionally,
they reported considerable challenges in comprehending the local variety of
Irish English (Interview with RS and HA, June 2015).
