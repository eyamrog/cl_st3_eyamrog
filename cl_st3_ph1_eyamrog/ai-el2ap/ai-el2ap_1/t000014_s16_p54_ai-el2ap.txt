The primary data consisted of audio and video recordings, saved
in .WAV and .MTS formats, respectively. Each session was documented
using both audio and video. Subsequently, the .MTS video files
were converted to .MP4 format to facilitate more efficient storage
and archiving. File names were structured to begin with the
ISO code for the language (PAB for Paresi and UNK
for Enawene Nawe), followed by the recording date in YYYYMMDD
format, the abbreviations of the recorder and the primary speaker,
and a session-specific keyword; for example, UNK-20200114-WE-YI-Kolito.MTS. These documentation projects
resulted in digital collections comprising over 150 hours of Paresi
recordings and 37 hours of Enawene Nawe recordings, which are
organized into seven categories as shown in Table 1.
