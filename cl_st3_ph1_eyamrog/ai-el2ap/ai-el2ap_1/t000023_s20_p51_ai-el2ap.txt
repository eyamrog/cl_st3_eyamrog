The present variety is distinguished from the typical form by
being approximately half its size and broader than long, as
described by Messikommer (1942). The material examined in this study
differs from the type specimen in exhibiting slightly larger dimensions,
with a length of 8–8.7 µm, a width of 9.3–9.8
µm, and an isthmus of 3 µm.
