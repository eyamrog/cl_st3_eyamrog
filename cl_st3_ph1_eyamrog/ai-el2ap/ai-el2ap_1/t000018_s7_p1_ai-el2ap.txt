Over the past decade, research in early childhood education has
identified several theoretical and methodological limitations that affect the effective
management of the educational process, particularly with respect to ensuring
quality and supporting the development and education of both children
and their families (1-9). These shortcomings have been recognized not
only due to increasing demands for improvement in educational outcomes,
but also because of the necessity to adequately prepare educators,
families, and other stakeholders involved in the educational process.
