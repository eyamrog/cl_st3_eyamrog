The following two extracts exemplify the predominant use of cued
elicitation (Mercer, 1995) and Socratic questioning (Roth, 1996), respectively, both
of which involve restrictive prompts that limit the discourse to
a specific line of reasoning. In these instances, students were
required to provide only brief responses in order to align
with the teacherâ€™s explanation from a scientific perspective. In the
first example, the lesson objective was to compare the evaporation
of water and perfume. Since the evaporation of water was
not directly observable by sight or touch, the use of
perfume served to demonstrate that a substance was leaving the
water and dispersing into the air. The teacher guided the
students through this line of reasoning, as illustrated in Extract
