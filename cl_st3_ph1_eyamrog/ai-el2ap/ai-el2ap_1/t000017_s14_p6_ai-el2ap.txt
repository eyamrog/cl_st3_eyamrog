Content validity was assessed through an item analysis of the
B-PREA-R, which involved evaluating each item's discrimination index (item-total correlation)
and difficulty index. The discrimination index was interpreted based on
the criteria established by Ebel and Frisbie (as cited in
Backhoff et al., 2000): items with values â‰¥ .39 were
considered high quality, values between .30 and .39 indicated good
quality, values between .20 and .29 indicated fair quality, and
values < .20 indicated low quality. The difficulty index was
classified according to Crocker and Algina (1986), with values of
.80 indicating low difficulty, values between .79 and .50 indicating
medium difficulty, and values < .50 indicating high difficulty.
