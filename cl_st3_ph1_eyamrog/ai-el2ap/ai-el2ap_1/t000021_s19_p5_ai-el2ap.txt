Teachers reported employing multiple emotion regulation strategies in response to
each emotional demand encountered. Overall, cognitive change was the most
frequently utilized strategy, often in combination with other approaches. Specifically,
cognitive change was used alongside situation selection (n = 16),
situation modification (n = 32), attention deployment (n = 10),
and response modulation (n = 14). The most commonly reported
sequences of strategy use were: (a) situation selection combined with
cognitive modification, and (b) situation modification combined with cognitive change.
