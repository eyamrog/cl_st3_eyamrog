In response to this issue, two main approaches have been
proposed: the use of selected tests from various neuropsychological batteries
(cross-battery assessment) (Franzen et al., 2022) and the application of
non-verbal neuropsychological tests (Ben et al., 2021). The cross-battery approach
enables examiners to select tests that are more appropriate for
individuals based on their cultural and educational backgrounds (Franzen et
al., 2022; Daugherty et al., 2017; Puente et al., 2017).
These authors recommend this method to reduce diagnostic errors attributable
to cultural or educational factors, and, in some cases, to
prevent inappropriate legal outcomes, such as the imposition of the
death penalty by the US Supreme Court. They argue that
diagnostic and classification standards may differ between demographic groups, such
as between Americans and Hispanic Americans, even when both groups
reside within the same broader cultural context. As a result,
cultural and educational influences can affect both the diagnosis of
neurological disorders and legal decisions. Consequently, misclassification due to inappropriate
diagnostic standards can have significant consequences, including the potential for
individuals with intellectual disabilities or neurological disorders to be wrongly
subjected to capital punishment (Daugherty et al., 2017; Puente et
al., 2017).
