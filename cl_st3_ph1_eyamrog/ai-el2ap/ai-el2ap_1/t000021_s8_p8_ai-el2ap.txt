In a qualitative study conducted within the context of professional
and technological education, contextual emotional demands experienced in the classroom
were identified and classified into three categories: affective interaction events
(such as conflicts with students and inappropriate behavior), technical-pedagogical factors
(including learning difficulties and student demotivation), and intrapersonal factors (such
as frustration and emotional dissonance). These factors have been found
to elicit a range of negative emotions in teachers, highlighting
the need for effective emotion regulation strategies to mitigate their
adverse effects on teachersâ€™ performance and well-being (Morais, Gondim, &
Palma, in press).
