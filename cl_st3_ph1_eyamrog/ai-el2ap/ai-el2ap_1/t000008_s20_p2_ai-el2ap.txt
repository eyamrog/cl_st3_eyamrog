The storage period negatively affected the germination performance of the
study species. The germination percentage of stored pyrenes decreased to
50% or less (Figure 2b). Germination times ranged from 18
to 33 days in freshly harvested pyrenes and were approximately
18 days in stored pyrenes (Figure 2c, d). The speed
index exhibited a similar pattern to the germination percentage (Figure
2e, f). This parameter serves as an indicator of the
rate of germinated seeds or pyrenes (or emerged seedlings) per
day and is also used as a metric for seedling
vigor (Maguire 1962; Ranal & Santana 2006). The initial water
content of the stored pyrenes decreased to 7% after one
year of storage. The results indicate that, although the germination
capacity of Copernicia alba Morong seeds from the Pantanal wetland
declined over time, the seeds remained relatively viable and capable
of germination for at least one year under the conditions
of this study. However, these findings also highlight the limitation
of relying solely on germination tests to assess seed viability.
Viability assessments such as tetrazolium and X-ray tests, which are
widely used in conservation programs (Terry et al. 2003; Gosling
2004; Riebkes et al. 2015), could have been employed to
determine whether non-germinated stored seeds remained viable or had entered
a state of secondary dormancy (Schlindwein et al. 2019). Future
research should incorporate these viability tests and evaluate different storage
conditions to optimize the maintenance of seed germinability in this
species.
