The Low Doce River region has experienced significant anthropogenic impacts
from urban and rural activities, primarily livestock, agriculture, and increasing
industrialization (Barroso et al. 2012), even prior to the Fundão
dam failure in 2015. The rupture of the dam released
approximately 43 million m³ of mining tailings downstream (Carmo et
al. 2017), resulting in substantial alterations to the fluvial system,
including increased erosion, environmental degradation, and iron (Fe) enrichment to
potentially harmful concentrations (Hatje et al. 2017). The scarcity of
floristic studies in this region, combined with evidence that mine
tailing inputs have previously induced taxonomic and functional changes in
various communities—such as benthic fauna (Burd 2002), marine macroalgal flora
(Correa et al. 1999), planktonic algae (Salonen et al. 2006),
and benthic algal communities (Lavoie et al. 2012)—underscores the need
for research on periphyton biodiversity in the area.
