Regardless of the institutional affiliation of those leading a documentation
and archiving initiative, there exists an ethical obligation to clearly
communicate the objectives, procedures, and potential outcomes of the project,
as well as to obtain informed consent from the speakers
and other community members involved. In the following sections, we
examine these ethical requirements and present strategies for addressing them
(§4.1), drawing on a case study from co-author Rosés Labrada’s
work with the Mako people of Venezuela (§4.2). The section
concludes with a discussion of approaches to facilitating community access
to archival materials (§4.3).
