Rhizomes are generally long-creeping and solenostelic, though they are rarely
dictyostelic or polycyclic, and typically bear hairs or, less commonly,
primitive scales. Leaves are monomorphic; stipes often possess epipetiolar buds
and usually contain an omega-shaped vascular strand. Laminae are 2-
to 5-pinnate, and are rarely less dissected. Veins are usually
free, but may rarely be anastomosing, in which case included
veinlets are absent. The indument consists of hairs, glandular hairs,
or may be absent. Sori are marginal or submarginal, linear
or discrete, introrse or extrorse, and are protected by outer
and/or inner indusia, or rarely lack protection. Spores are either
tetrahedral and trilete, or reniform and monolete (Smith et al.
2006).
