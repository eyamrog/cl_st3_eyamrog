The assumption that mere possession of digital equipment automatically results
in comprehensive knowledge is unfounded, as research indicates that knowledge
acquisition depends on multiple factors beyond access to technology, including
formal instruction, favorable teaching conditions, and appropriate psycho-emotional support (Peixoto
& Ara√∫jo, 2012; Luria, 2008; Davydov, 1999). Similarly, for teachers,
access to equipment and the internet alone is insufficient for
the effective pedagogical integration of information and communication technologies (ICT)
within their subject areas; they must also develop the requisite
knowledge and skills to utilize these resources effectively.
