Rosés Labrada observed that the concept of archiving was insufficiently
defined, particularly regarding the implications of online sharing of materials
that identify specific individuals and the available options for sharing
or restricting access to those materials or the names of
individuals. To address this, he implemented measures to ensure that
the community fully understood the archiving process. His objective was
to provide a clear representation of what the archived collection
would entail; however, this effort was complicated by the community’s
limited access to the Internet.
