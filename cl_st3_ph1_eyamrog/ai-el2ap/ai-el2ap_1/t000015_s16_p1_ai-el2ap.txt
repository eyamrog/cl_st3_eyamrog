The JUOJS utilizes an optional PKP Beacon, introduced with the
software in 2015, which allows PKP to inform OJS users
about security patches and other software updates. The beacon also
transmits indexing information about the journal, such as the journal’s
title, ISSN, number of items published, titles, and abstracts. This
study adopted the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ, 2020)
criterion for “active” journals, defined as those publishing at least
five items per year. The resulting publicly available data set
for 2020 comprised 25,671 journals, representing 36.5% of the 70,214
OJS beacons in operation at that time (Khanna et al.,
2021). The number of journals using OJS has demonstrated an
upward trend over the previous decade (Figure 1). In 2020,
journals in the data set published an average of 38.1
items each, totaling approximately 996,000 items for the year, and
have collectively published 5.4 million items since their inception. On
average, a single OJS installation hosts 2.62 active journals.
