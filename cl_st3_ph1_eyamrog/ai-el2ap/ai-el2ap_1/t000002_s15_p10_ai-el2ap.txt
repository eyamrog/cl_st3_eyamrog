Utterances related to the task content were classified according to
their discursive functions, drawing on the IRF (Initiation-Response-Feedback) pattern and
the dialogic features that characterize productive talk (Howe et al.,
2019). Six codes were developed, corresponding to the three moves
of triadic discourse: invitation (INV), dialogic invitation (D_INV), contribution (CON),
dialogic contribution (D_CON), follow-up (FOL), and dialogic evaluation (D_EVA). This
distinction was applied exclusively to content-related utterances, as these are
the primary means through which knowledge construction and conceptual learning
occur.
