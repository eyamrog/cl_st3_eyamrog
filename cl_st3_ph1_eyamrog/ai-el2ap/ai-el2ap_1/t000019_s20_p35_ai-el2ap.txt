According to Davydov (1999), possessing only basic information technology (IT)
knowledge is insufficient for the comprehensive development of individuals. Therefore,
merely owning a mobile phone, regardless of its capabilities, without
understanding how to use it effectively or being aware of
its technical features, does not constitute genuine progress in digital
inclusion or in the acquisition of technical knowledge and access
to IT.
