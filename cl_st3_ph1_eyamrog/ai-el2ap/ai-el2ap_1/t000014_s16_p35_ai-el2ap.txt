Archives have traditionally expanded their collections through proactive donations from
living individuals, often academic researchers, or through bequests from the
estates of deceased individuals. However, the scope and diversity of
archival holdings can be enhanced through additional approaches. Increasingly, speakers
and other Indigenous collaborators are contributing both directly and indirectly
to the archival process, as discussed in §4. Furthermore, researchers,
community members, and archive staff can actively seek out and
preserve legacy materials, a process that may involve collaboration among
multiple stakeholders. This section examines practical considerations in the identification
and archiving of legacy materials—defined as written or audiovisual materials
collected prior to the widespread adoption of digital recording and
archiving methods (§5.1)—as well as considerations related to their subsequent
use (§5.2).
