Similar to spoken conversation, a game of capoeira is characterized
by a specific tone, which is influenced by various factors
such as the occasion and the personalities of the players.
For example, a friendly game at the end of a
class typically differs from a game played in a roda
where participants may seek to impress students from other schools.
During public performances, the emphasis is often on non-confrontational playfulness
and acrobatic movements. As previously noted, the tone and pace
of the game are consistently determined by the music.
