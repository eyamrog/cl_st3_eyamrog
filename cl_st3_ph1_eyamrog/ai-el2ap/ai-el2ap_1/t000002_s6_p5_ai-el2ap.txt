Although quantitative and qualitative methods are often contrasted, both methodologies
serve important and complementary roles in educational research (Snell &
Lefstein, 2011). Systematic coding provides a structured approach for managing
large data sets and identifying general patterns across multiple lessons
or tasks, enabling statistical comparisons and developmental analyses (Mercer et
al., 2004). In contrast, sociocultural discourse analysis facilitates a detailed
and multi-dimensional examination of the complexities inherent in classroom dialogue
(Asterhan et al., 2020). Whereas systematic coding reduces discursive interactions
to measurable variables consistent with a positivist framework, sociocultural discourse
analysis captures the complexity and interpretative depth of discursive exchanges.
