Ex-situ conservation of palm seeds has been consistently associated with
a decline in seed viability over time (Broschat 1994, Orozco-Segovia
et al. 2003, Nascimento et al. 2010, Jacob & Decruse
2015, Oliveira et al. 2015, Felix et al. 2017, Beltrame
et al. 2018, Bastos et al. 2021). The viability of
tropical palm seeds during storage is influenced by several external
factors, including temperature and storage duration, as well as intrinsic
factors such as seed moisture content, degree of seed maturation,
and desiccation sensitivity (recalcitrance) (Roberts 1973, Orozco-Segovia et al. 2003,
Baskin & Baskin 2014, Sano et al. 2015). Recalcitrant seeds
are unable to tolerate water loss below a threshold of
approximately 12%, resulting in rapid viability loss under laboratory storage
conditions (Hong & Ellis 1996) and limited potential for persistence
in soil seed banks (Oliveira et al. 2015). In contrast,
orthodox seeds can maintain viability during long-term ex-situ storage when
kept under appropriate environmental conditions (Hong & Ellis 1996). The
longevity of stored palm seeds varies among species, and optimal
ex-situ conservation conditions generally involve reducing metabolic activity by maintaining
relatively low humidity and temperature levels (Pivetta et al. 2011).
Laboratory studies have recommended storage temperatures between 18 and 23Â°C
for most palm seeds (Broschat 1994), and these conditions have
been tested for certain tropical species, such as Acrocomia aculeata
from the Cerrado savannas (Ribeiro et al. 2012) and Copernicia
alba from Brazilian wetlands (Masetto et al. 2012).
