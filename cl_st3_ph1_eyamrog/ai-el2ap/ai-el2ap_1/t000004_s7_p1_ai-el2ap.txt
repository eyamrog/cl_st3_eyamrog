The relationship between actual language teaching and learning (LTL) and
theories of language learning has been a subject of ongoing
scholarly interest. Structural approaches were originally informed by Bloomfieldian structural
linguistics and behaviorist theory. This paradigm was subsequently challenged by
Chomsky’s mentalist perspective, which emphasized the cognitive processes of the
learner and has influenced LTL research for several decades. In
the past two decades, there has been a sociolinguistically informed
shift that conceptualizes language learning as a contextual process. Notable
contributions to this perspective include "The Classroom and Beyond" (Wagner,
2004) and "The Social Turn in SLA" (Block, 2003). These
approaches have contextualized the language learning process and provided a
more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the learner, drawing on
developments in pragmatic and discourse analysis as well as research
on both language and culture learning. The focus on “authentic
language” and efforts to define it for classroom application exemplify
issues arising from this contextual perspective. More recently, there have
been calls to integrate external, real-world elements into classroom learning
(Roberts & Baynham, 2006), as well as approaches that advocate
for language learning experiences outside the classroom environment, referred to
as learning “in the wild” (Eskildsen & Theodórsdóttir, 2015).
