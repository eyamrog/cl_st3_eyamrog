Another proposed solution is the use of multiple visual-type tests,
as these are generally considered to impose a lower cultural
and educational burden. Respondents are expected to complete such tasks
using strategies that require minimal specialized knowledge, such as distinguishing
between up and down, right and left, shallow and deep,
or differences in size and color. However, it should be
noted that nonverbal tests are not entirely free from cultural
bias, since cognitive frameworks can differ across cultures. Despite this
limitation, visual-type tests are regarded as an appropriate solution for
use with child populations.
