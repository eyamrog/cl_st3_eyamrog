In seeking a more comprehensive analysis of the relationship between
technology and human beings, Feenberg (2003) argues that technologies should
be subject to more democratic and participatory processes that recognize
them as cultural artefacts, taking into account their socio-historical and
relational dimensions. According to Feenberg, such an approach would enable
collective control over technological use, informed by an understanding of
both its potential benefits and risks.
