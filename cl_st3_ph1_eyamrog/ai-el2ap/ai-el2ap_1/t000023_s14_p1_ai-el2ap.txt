The study was conducted in three cities in Espírito Santo
State: Baixo Guandu, Colatina, and Linhares. Detailed information regarding the
study area and sampling design is provided in Zorzal-Almeida et
al. (2021). For taxonomic and ecological analyses, at least five
non-permanent slides were prepared for each sample. Observations and photographs
of the material were obtained using a Motic Panthera L
digital binocular upright Olympus microscope and a Moticam 3.0 MP
camera, respectively. The following taxonomic characteristics were examined for identification
and description: cell shape, number and position of chloroplasts and
pyrenoids, cell wall structure, and metric data including cell length,
cell width, and isthmus width. Measurements of cell length (L),
cell width (W), and isthmus width (I) were performed using
Motic Image Plus 3.0 software. Identification was based on classical
literature (e.g., Ralfs 1848; West & West 1895, 1902; Croasdale
1956; Scott & Grönblad 1957; Krieger 1932) as well as
recent publications (e.g., Coesel & Meesters 2007; Oliveira et al.
2016; Bicudo et al. 2019).
