In CEAP pedagogy, technological devices can be utilized to assess
students’ performance in CEAP tasks, monitor their progress throughout the
course, and evaluate the overall effectiveness of the courses (cf.
Chun, 2009). The introduction of new instructional modalities, such as
computer-assisted language learning (CALL) and distance or blended learning, represents
a significant advantage that information and communication technology (ICT) has
contributed to the implementation of CEAP courses (cf. Arnó-Macià &
Rueda-Ramos, 2011). Furthermore, in the context of CEAP course design,
ICT can support the development of tasks, the structuring of
syllabi, and the conduct of needs analyses, whether for analyzing
the present situation (cf. Vieira & Aranha, 2015a, 2015b; Vieira,
2017; Aranha & Vieira, 2018; Vieira, 2020) or the target
situation (Vieira, 2019b). The following section examines the application of
ICT in target situation analysis.
