O’Hagan was acquainted with Weiss’s work through his own field
research with speakers of the related Caquinte language, but had
previously overlooked the “Design and Method” section of Weiss’s dissertation.
This section indicates that, at least during a certain period,
Weiss maintained field notes, index cards (also referred to as
slips), biological specimens, photographs, and sound recordings. Gerald Weiss later
became a professor of anthropology at Florida Atlantic University, and
as of March 2021, a Google search confirmed his continued
affiliation with the institution as an emeritus professor. Additionally, a
phone inquiry at that time established that all of the
aforementioned materials, along with further documentation from postdoctoral research, were
stored at his residence in Florida (see ANWAR, 2021 for
further information).
