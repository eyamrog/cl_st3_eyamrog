In parallel with critiques of essentialized notions of community, the
social sciences have witnessed the emergence of a new orientation
toward the study of contemporary mobilities. This shift represents a
broad epistemological movement away from “sedentarist approaches” (Hannam et al.,
2006, p. 5) and toward a focus on mobility, deterritorialization,
and the increasing complexity and diversity of transnational population movements.
Sociolinguists conducting research in multilingual contexts have incorporated the concept
of mobility in various ways, adopting new theoretical frameworks. For
instance, Heller (2011, pp. 5–6) contends that research should shift
its focus “from stability to mobility,” necessitating a fundamental reconsideration
of both theoretical and methodological approaches in this field. Heller
(2007, p. 6) further argues that “tools of enquiry refined
when the focus was on boundaries, stability and homogeneity require
refashioning for addressing movement, diversity and multiplicity.” Rather than concentrating
on “stable communities,” she emphasizes the importance of examining the
trajectories of social actors across time and space, and understanding
how their communicative repertoires are shaped within these trajectories. The
concept of trajectory facilitates the analysis of intersecting temporal and
spatial dimensions, moving beyond synchronic perspectives. Moreover, it allows for
a more nuanced account of the complexities inherent in contemporary
transnational movements, including prolonged stays in multiple countries and the
resulting access to diverse linguistic resources and bodies of knowledge.
