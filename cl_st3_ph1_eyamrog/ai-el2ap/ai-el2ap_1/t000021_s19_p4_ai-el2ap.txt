In terms of frequency and definition, the cognitive change strategies
family (n = 135, 30%) was the most frequently cited
and involved efforts to reassess either the situation or the
teacher’s capacity to manage it, with the aim of altering
its emotional impact. Situation modification (n = 117, 26%) was
the second most frequently mentioned strategy family and encompassed attempts
to directly or indirectly modify a situation—such as by seeking
assistance or intervention from others—or to intentionally display emotions (e.g.,
through feigning or exaggeration) in order to influence students or
other stakeholders. Response modulation (n = 69, 15%) ranked third
in frequency and included strategies aimed at influencing the experiential,
behavioral, or physiological components of the emotional response. Attention deployment
(n = 63, 14%) was the fourth most common strategy
and involved redirecting attention, either through distraction or focused concentration,
to modify emotional responses. Situation selection (n = 53, 12%)
involved the deliberate approach or avoidance of specific circumstances (such
as particular methodologies, activities, classes, students, or colleagues) based on
anticipated emotional outcomes. Among preventive strategies, direct modification (n =
89; situation modification) was the most frequently cited, followed by
positive cognitive reappraisal (n = 40), external causal attribution (n
= 28), perspective-taking (n = 27), and cognitive modification. Suppression
(n = 25) was the most emphasized reactive strategy, followed
by social sharing (n = 21; response modulation). Although genuine
expression (n = 19, 4%) is not classified as a
self-regulating strategy—since it does not involve the regulation of emotional
experience or expression—it was identified in focus groups as a
coping mechanism and is therefore included in the present analysis.
