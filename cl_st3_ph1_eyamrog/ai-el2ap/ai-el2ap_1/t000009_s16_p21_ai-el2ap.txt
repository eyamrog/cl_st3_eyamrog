The use of ICT in Phase 2 was significant for
investigating critical issues remotely. It enabled the continuation of research
practices commonly employed in face-to-face interviews, such as audio and
video recording, through the use of widely available free software.
Additionally, screen sharing with participants in Part 1 was essential
for maintaining a second-person perspective during data collection and proved
to be more effective than using printed materials. When participants
have a complete view of the array on the screen,
they can more easily follow the data entered by the
researcher and provide immediate feedback or corrections without the need
to amend paper documents. Furthermore, this approach allows the researcher
to conclude the interview with data already digitized and prepared
for analysis.
