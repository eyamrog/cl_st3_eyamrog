In contrast, strategies such as excessive worry, identification of flaws,
and self-blame—which are associated with psychological disorders (Nelis et al.,
2011)—were most frequently reported by more experienced teachers in the
basic education sector. Notably, these same teachers also reported higher
use of active coping strategies and an approach-oriented attitude. One
possible explanation is that the high frequency and intensity of
interactions with students necessitate substantial emotional labor, which may contribute
to emotional exhaustion over the course of a teaching career
(Yin et al., 2017). Additionally, excessive emotional labor, repeated unsuccessful
attempts, and misdirected efforts—often resulting from trial-and-error approaches—may overload and
diminish emotional and cognitive resources, potentially leading teachers to negatively
reassess their professional competence and self-image. While exposure to emotional
events can be beneficial by broadening the emotional repertoire (Aldao
et al., 2015), it may also have detrimental effects over
time if not managed effectively.
