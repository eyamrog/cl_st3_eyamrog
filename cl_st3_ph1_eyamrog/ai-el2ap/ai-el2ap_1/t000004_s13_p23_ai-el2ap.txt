The speed and style of the game can also be
regulated through the lyrics of the song. For example, Sophie
described that when she felt angry about being caught in
front of everyone, she would begin to play very quickly
and aggressively. At such moments, the teacher or master would
call her to the pé do berimbau (the foot of
the berimbau) using the instrument and sing a song with
the lyrics "devagar, devagarinho," which means "slow down, slow down,"
to encourage her to moderate her pace. Alternatively, the teacher
could choose to allow the aggressive style to continue by
singing a different song, such as "quebra gereba, quebra," which
refers to defeating or overpowering opponents (Interview with Sophie –
audio transcription).
