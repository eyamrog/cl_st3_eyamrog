Despite the potential benefits of flexible service delivery through ICT
for the population, the primary drivers of ICT expansion are
often economic and control interests, particularly in the context of
relations between developed and developing countries. The commercialization of ICT
and its associated services is frequently obscured by rhetoric emphasizing
citizenship. As Brenda et al. (2018, p. 5) note, “citizenship
has been subject to deep forms of marketization. The right
to have rights is therefore conditional on the market and
sharply graded around organized and organizable capacities, resources, interests, etc.”
Consequently, it is important to critically assess the intensity of
recommendations and implementations regarding ICT use in various services. While
increased ICT adoption may reduce government expenditures, it can also
contribute to greater social exclusion and a decline in the
quality of services that depend on human resources, such as
education.
