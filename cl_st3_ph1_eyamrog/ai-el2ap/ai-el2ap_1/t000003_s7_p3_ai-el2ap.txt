This research identified the complex and context-dependent processes through which
Timorese migrants construct their identities, highlighting the active ways in
which they utilize various linguistic, cultural, and semiotic resources. The
findings underscore the necessity to reconsider the design and scope
of current research on language, migration, and deterritorialization. While it
remains important to document how linguistic repertoires and language practices
are influenced by language policies and educational experiences in migrantsâ€™
countries of origin, it is equally essential to examine the
social processes related to reterritorialization, including what Hannam et al.
(2006) describe as mooring, as well as the communicative practices
that emerge during these specific, situated processes. A comprehensive understanding
of how multilingual resources are reconfigured in transnational migration, and
how identities are constructed across different social domains, can only
be achieved by maintaining a dual focus on both migration
and mooring.
