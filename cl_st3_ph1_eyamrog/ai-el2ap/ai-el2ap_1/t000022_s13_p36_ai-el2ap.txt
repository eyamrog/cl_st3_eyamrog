In the other countries, although the ten-year period was also
marked by a decline in the proportion of articles published
in Spanish in favor of English, English did not surpass
Spanish as the dominant language. There is a notable variation
by discipline. In journals classified under Agricultural Sciences, Engineering and
Technologies, and Natural and Exact Sciences, the proportion of articles
published in English increased from 29% in 2009 to 42%
in 2018, while the proportion published in Spanish decreased from
70% to 57% over the same period. Thus, Spanish, the
official language in most Latin American countries, remained the predominant
language of publication.
