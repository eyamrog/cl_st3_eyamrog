The children were randomly selected from several classrooms using lists
provided by school teachers. Selection of both the children and
educational institutions was based on the following researcher-defined criteria: (1)
children were required to score at or above the 50th
percentile on the Raven's Matrices intelligence test, according to Cuban
normative data (Ramírez et al., 2017); and (2) children had
to be native residents of urban areas in the provinces
of Cienfuegos and Sancti Spíritus. All participants were children with
typical development and without any reported medical or neurological conditions.
