The degree of international collaboration by Brazilian researchers in mainstream
journals appears to be influenced by the country's linguistic distinctiveness
within Latin America, its increasing preference for publishing in English,
and its internationalization policies that prioritize North America and Europe.
In contrast, Spanish-speaking Latin American authors demonstrate a more consistent
pattern of intra-regional collaboration. Analysis of the OLIVA corpus indicates
that Brazilian authors are more likely to collaborate with other
Brazilians, whereas authors from Argentina, Mexico, and Chile more frequently
engage in collaborative work with colleagues from other Latin American
countries. Nevertheless, Brazilian researchers also constitute a significant proportion of
co-authors in articles published in journals edited outside Brazil. For
instance, among articles with Argentine authors and international collaboration (n=3,906),
at least one Brazilian co-author is present in 26.5% of
cases; for collaborative articles with Chilean authors (n=5,376), Brazilian co-authorship
occurs in 19% of cases; and for Colombian authors (n=6,729),
the figure is 16.6%. While national collaboration is predominant among
Brazilian authors in journals edited in Brazil, their participation in
co-authored articles published in other countries is also substantial. Further
analysis of the OLIVA database will be conducted to map
international collaboration patterns, with particular attention to the balance between
intra-regional and extra-regional collaboration by discipline and by country. Future
research will also examine whether Brazilian authors are more likely
to collaborate with colleagues from outside the region than with
those from Spanish-speaking countries, and whether this tendency is influenced
by the perceived prestige of the journal.
