The extract above illustrates a rare instance of a verbal
comment occurring simultaneously with singing; however, in the context of
a capoeira class, speaking and singing are typically mutually exclusive
activities. At the start of the class, when Sandro begins
playing the berimbau, this action functions as a signal for
the students to cease their conversations. Shortly thereafter, he initiates
the opening lines of the Ladainha, a song traditionally performed
at the beginning of the roda in capoeira Angola. The
Ladainha is an integral component of the ritual, containing references
to God and prominent mestres, and students are expected to
listen attentively in order to comprehend its message fully (Pinheiro,
2022). Following this, the students join Sandro in singing the
chorus, and without interruption, Sandro proceeds directly to another song.
