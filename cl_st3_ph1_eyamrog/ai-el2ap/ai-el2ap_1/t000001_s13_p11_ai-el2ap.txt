Long-read polishing is performed prior to short-read polishing because it
is less affected by genomic repeats. In this context, a
repeat refers to a sequence that causes reads to align
to multiple or incorrect locations within the genome. For instance,
certain 150-bp short reads may be entirely contained within the
rRNA operon, resulting in their alignment to multiple genomic positions
and classifying the operon as a repeat, which can hinder
the ability of polishing tools to accurately correct errors. In
contrast, 20 kbp long reads are capable of spanning the
entire rRNA operon, allowing them to align uniquely to the
genome. As a result, the operon does not function as
a repeat for long reads, thereby enabling polishing corrections to
be applied accurately to the appropriate instances of the operon.
