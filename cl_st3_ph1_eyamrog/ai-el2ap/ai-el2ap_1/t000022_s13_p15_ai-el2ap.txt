A central issue in current discussions of scholarly publishing concerns
the shift in business models from subscription-based access to author-funded
publication through Article Processing Charges (APCs). We collected data on
publication fees from the official websites of each journal included
in our study. In the majority of cases, journals did
not disclose publication fees. Further analysis indicated that this lack
of information was attributable to their status as diamond open
access journals, which do not charge fees to either authors
or readers. Among the 1,720 journals analyzed, 10% impose APCs,
with the majority of these (60% of the 182 journals
charging APCs) being published in Brazil. This finding contrasts with
the results reported by Appel and Albagli (2019), who, in
examining a broader set of Brazilian journals, found a much
lower incidence of APCs. In the OLIVA database, Brazil is
identified as leading the adoption of the APC business model,
followed, in descending order, by journals published in Mexico, Chile,
Argentina, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela.
