In Cuba, the cultural-historical approach serves as the theoretical and
methodological foundation for assessing comprehensive development in early childhood educational
practice. Within this framework, the educational sciences have established specific
forms of evaluation, as well as methods and procedures for
early childhood assessment, which are systematically outlined in official improvement
documents.
