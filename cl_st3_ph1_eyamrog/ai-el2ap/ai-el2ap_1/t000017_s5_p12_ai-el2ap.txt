Although this study makes a significant contribution to the assessment
of cognitive development in the preschool stage by presenting nine
subtests for educators to administer and providing cut-off points for
evaluating children's progress, its primary limitation is the sample size
relative to the national population. Future research should address this
limitation by including a larger and more representative sample from
various provinces across the country. Additionally, further studies could employ
statistical measures such as the ROC curve and compare the
established cut-off points with those obtained from populations of children
with special educational needs or developmental delays.
