This variety differs from the typical form of the species
by its larger overall dimensions, the presence of an inflated
region visible in the apical view, and the slightly truncate
angles, as described by Krieger and Gerloff (1962). The material
examined in the present study was slightly smaller than the
specimens originally described by Krieger and Gerloff (1962).
