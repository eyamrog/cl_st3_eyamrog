Phase 1 was designed to increase the visibility of the
selected scientists. Phase 2 was divided into two parts, each
with a distinct objective: Part 1 assessed the participants' ability
to produce research articles suitable for publication in high-impact journals,
while Part 2 explored in greater depth certain contextual factors
previously examined in the questionnaire. Finally, Phase 3 concluded the
investigation by analyzing the reviews received by the authors for
papers submitted to computer science journals.
