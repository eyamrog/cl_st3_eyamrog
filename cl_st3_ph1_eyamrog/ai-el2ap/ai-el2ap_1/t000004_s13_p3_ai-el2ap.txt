The conditions on the ships transporting Africans from Africa to
Brazil were extremely harsh, resulting in the death of approximately
10% of those on board (Cohn, 1985; see also Alencastro,
2018). Upon arrival, enslaved individuals were deliberately separated from others
who spoke the same language to prevent communication among them.
They subsequently became the primary labor force, initially working on
sugarcane and cotton plantations, and later in mines and on
coffee plantations.
