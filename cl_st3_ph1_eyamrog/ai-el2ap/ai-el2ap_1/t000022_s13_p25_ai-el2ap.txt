For authors from Chile, certain distinctions in the general trends
observed in the OLIVA database are evident. The proportions of
articles with individual authorship or international collaboration are more than
twice as high as those found in journals from Brazil,
while the incidence of national collaboration is comparatively lower. Chile
exhibits the highest rate of co-authorship with researchers from other
countries among all cases analyzed, which, as discussed below, may
reflect distinctive characteristics of its academic culture within the region.
Among the other countries, Cuba shows patterns similar to Brazil
but with a higher level of international collaboration. In contrast,
Colombia and Mexico resemble Chile, although they demonstrate a greater
proportion of national collaboration.
