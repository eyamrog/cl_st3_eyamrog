This variety is distinguished from the typical form by its
thinner cell wall, more open sinus, and relatively broader cells
(Krieger & Gerloff 1962). In the population examined in the
present study, specimens exhibited a wider range of length-to-width ratios
compared to previous reports; Krieger and Gerloff (1962) noted that
the length of this variety is approximately 1.25 times its
width.
