This study aimed to characterize the emotional labor of teachers
in professional and technological education by examining the emotions experienced
and the emotion regulation strategies employed. Data were collected through
eight focus groups involving a total of forty-one teachers. Both
inductive and deductive categorization methods were used for data analysis.
The results indicate that specific emotional demands elicit distinct emotions
and that teachers employ a range of regulation strategies, either
individually or in combination. Cognitive change and situation modification strategies,
as described in the procedural model of emotion regulation, were
reported most frequently. The findings also suggest that teachersâ€™ regulatory
preferences vary according to career stage and area of training
or performance. Future research could employ diverse methods, such as
observation diaries, to further investigate the dynamic and contextual nature
of emotion regulation and its outcomes, and to develop a
contextualized scale for teacher emotion regulation. These findings have implications
for teacher training programs, educational management, and subsequent research.
