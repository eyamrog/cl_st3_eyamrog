Regarding knowledge of Digital Information and Communication Technologies (DICT), it
is important to note that a lack of such knowledge
affects the general population, including both teachers and students. Analysis
of socioeconomic classes A and B indicates that at least
90% of individuals possess a functional understanding of information technology
(CGI.br, 2019a). In contrast, this is not the case among
lower socioeconomic classes, as public schools—where the majority of these
individuals are or were enrolled—do not yet provide this type
of education. Additionally, financial and employment constraints prevent them from
enrolling in private courses. When asked about their lack of
basic informatics knowledge, individuals from classes D and E cited
the associated costs as the primary barrier (CGI.br, 2019a, 2018a).
