In October 2014, it was identified that there were nine
Timorese men’s and boys’ football teams in the Dungannon/Cookstown area,
as listed in Table 2. The names of these clubs
reflected various aspects of the players’ identities, utilizing different linguistic
resources, including Portuguese. The majority of players in FC Tahi
Calu and FC Moko United were Fataluku speakers originating from
Lospalos in the eastern region of Timor-Leste, and the club
names indicated their regional affiliation. Similarly, the name of FC
Matebian indexed the regional identity of its players, who were
primarily from the Baucau area and the eastern and central
regions, with most players being Makasai speakers.
