A critical factor in Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing is
read depth, which directly influences both genome assembly and polishing
accuracy. Increased read depth facilitates more robust assembly by enabling
the use of multiple independent read sets in tools such
as Trycycler (see Step 3), and it improves consensus accuracy
during polishing (see Step 4). For high-quality assemblies, a minimum
read depth of 100× is recommended, with 200× considered optimal;
depths exceeding 200× may offer marginal improvements but are subject
to diminishing returns. In practice, a single ONT flow cell
often generates more data than required for sequencing a single
bacterial isolate, making sample multiplexing a common strategy in microbial
genomics. While this approach does not generally compromise assembly quality,
potential issues such as barcode leakage should be taken into
account (see Pitfalls).
