This paper investigates the potential of a diasporic capoeira group
based in Leeds, UK, as a context for Portuguese language
learning. Capoeira, as identified in our study, is a practice
characterized by a complex and contested history. We begin by
outlining the historical development and practice of capoeira, and subsequently
consider its potential for informal language learning, focusing on both
the opportunities it provides and the evidence indicating that participants
acquire elements of Portuguese, which may be termed Portuguese for
Capoeira Purposes. The study of Languages for Specific Purposes is
informed by the linguistic concept of register. Our initial research
questions addressed the potential for learning Afro-Brazilian Portuguese language and
culture through capoeira, as well as the linguistic and cultural
knowledge required by novice capoeiristas to participate effectively. However, as
our analysis progressed, the scope of our investigation expanded in
significant ways.
