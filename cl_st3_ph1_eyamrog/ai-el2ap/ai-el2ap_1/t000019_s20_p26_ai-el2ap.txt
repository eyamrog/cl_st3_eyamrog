According to CGI.br (2019b), 56% of teachers report knowing how
to manipulate files and folders, while 29% are able to
create files for a slide show. Although these are basic
digital tasks, the proportion of teachers proficient in them remains
relatively low. Additionally, only 34% of teachers over the age
of 30 have participated in continuing education, whereas 54% of
teachers aged 30 or younger received some instruction in information
and communication technologies (ICT) during their college education. Furthermore, 70%
of teachers use digital information and communication technologies (DICT) exclusively
for pedagogical and academic planning purposes.
