Patients with malignant fungating wounds experience physical, psychological, social, and
spiritual distress, collectively described as "total pain" according to Cecily
Saunders' conceptual framework. The pain associated with these wounds may
result from tumor infiltration and can be nociceptive or neuropathic
in origin. Additionally, pain may arise from moisture-associated periwound skin
damage or from manipulation during wound dressing changes.
