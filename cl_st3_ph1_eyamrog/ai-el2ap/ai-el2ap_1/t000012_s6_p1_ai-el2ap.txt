Cleaning interactions between birds and mammals encompass a wide range
of species and ecological contexts. By analyzing two networks of
differing sizes and geographic locations, this study aimed to identify
patterns in facultative interactions from a broader perspective. Species with
a broad dietary repertoire may participate in various types of
interactions, including facultative associations such as cleaning symbiosis. When a
bird encounters an opportunity—defined here as the presence of a
mammal hosting accessible food resources—the likelihood of exploiting this opportunity
is determined by the species’ natural history. The results indicate
that, for most cleaner species, the capacity to consume diverse
resources is an important factor in engaging in cleaning interactions.
Given the significance of dietary diversity for participation in these
interactions, it was hypothesized that network structural properties, such as
degree centrality, might also be influenced by dietary diversity. The
objective of this analysis was to assess the implications of
resource consumption for community structure. However, the analysis of network
degree centrality revealed no relationship between centrality and the diet
diversity index of bird species, indicating that the ability to
consume a variety of resources does not influence a species’
centrality within the network.
