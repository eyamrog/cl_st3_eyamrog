A simple linear regression analysis was conducted using neuropsychological test
scores from two provinces. Neuropsychological variables served as predictors (independent
variables), while intellectual performance, as measured by the Raven's Progressive
Matrices (nonverbal) for preschoolers, was the dependent variable. Results were
presented using a radial graph to illustrate the neuropsychological profiles,
highlighting relative strengths and weaknesses between the two provinces. Statistical
significance was determined at a threshold of p < 0.05,
with values below this level indicating significant differences.
