In response to this limitation, Ramirez et al. (2018) developed
the PreAcademic Battery (B-PREA), an instrument designed to assess cognitive
development in children aged 4 to 6 years and to
evaluate school readiness. The administration of the B-PREA requires approximately
20 to 25 minutes. The battery is theoretically grounded in
two main sources: (1) Luria's theory as applied to the
preschool stage (Solovieva & Quintanar, 2013; Manga & Ramos, 2006),
and (2) principles from cognitive neuropsychology relevant to the development
of assessment tools for preschool children (Tenorio et al., 2014;
Portellano, 2000). Despite these foundations, the B-PREA remains a complex
instrument for preschool educators to use.
