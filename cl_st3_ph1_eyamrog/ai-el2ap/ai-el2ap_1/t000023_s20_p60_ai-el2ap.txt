The present variety differs from the typical form by possessing
relatively shorter cells, with lengths approximately equal to their widths
(West & West 1908). In this study, two distinct phenotypic
expressions of Cosmarium rectangulare var. hexagonum were observed. Several specimens
exhibited a smaller length-to-width ratio and a retuse apex, consistent
with the type described by West & West (1908), while
one specimen was notably longer than the others and displayed
a very broad, truncate apex.
