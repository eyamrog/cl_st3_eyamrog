After basecalling, quality control (QC) filtering can enhance the quality
of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) reads. The use of Filtlong
with the parameter --keep_percent 90 is recommended to remove the
lowest quality reads, characterized by short length and low accuracy.
In cases where the read set exhibits a low N50
value but high sequencing depth, excluding short reads (for example,
those shorter than 5 kbp) may improve assembly outcomes; however,
this approach may reduce the recovery of small plasmids (see
Pitfalls).
