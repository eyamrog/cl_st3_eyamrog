This study subsequently examines the case of Brazil, which accounts
for 50% of the total articles published in the database
and demonstrates a high incidence of co-authorship among Brazilian authors.
To further investigate this pattern, a detailed analysis of the
SciELO Brazil collection, which includes only journals published in Brazil,
was conducted. The results indicate a strong tendency for scientific
collaboration among authors affiliated with institutions in different states within
Brazil, despite being from the same country. These findings challenge
the assumption that domestic collaboration necessarily reflects academic inbreeding and
instead highlight the complexity and dynamic nature of the Brazilian
academic landscape.
