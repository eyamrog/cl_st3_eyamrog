Gross (2015) argues that research focusing on emotion regulation within
specific work contexts can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms,
contextual applications, and immediate outcomes—such as emotional responses—associated with particular
regulation strategies. Furthermore, Gross proposes that a productive direction for
future research is to examine how individual strategies are operationalized
through specific tactics and how multiple strategies may interact in
sequence, thereby moving beyond traditional models that conceptualize strategies as
decontextualized, isolated, and linear. This context-sensitive approach has practical implications
for teacher education programs and interventions, as it may enhance
the development of teachers’ emotional regulation skills. The following sections
present the theoretical and conceptual foundations, empirical evidence, and recent
research questions that inform and justify the current study.
