With respect to the intellectual development of the groups, the
performance of the Espirituano participants on the Raven test was
significantly higher than that of the Cienfuegueros group. These results
support the view that nonverbal tests are not entirely free
from cultural influences (Ben et al., 2021). Additionally, the findings
indicate that nonverbal tasks involve complex reasoning processes that contribute
to differences in individual performance. Although Ravenâ€™s Matrices can be
solved using relatively straightforward strategies such as scanning vertically or
horizontally, they also require the use of more complex cognitive
strategies, including induction and deduction, inference comparison, classification, hypothesis generation
and evaluation, identification of relationships, and image extrapolation.
