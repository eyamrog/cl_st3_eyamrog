Following water immersion treatments at room temperature and in hot
water, germination trials were conducted. Seeds were placed in rolls
of Germitest® paper that had been pre-moistened with distilled water
at a ratio of 2.5 times the dry weight of
the paper (Brasil 2009). All rolls containing pretreated and untreated
pyrenes were enclosed in plastic bags to minimize water loss
and incubated under a 12-hour photoperiod provided by fluorescent light
(4 x 20 W) with alternating temperatures of 20–30°C, as
recommended for optimal germination of C. alba (Fava & Albuquerque
2011). The rolls were rotated within the incubators four times
per week. Germination was assessed daily for up to 45
days, using the protrusion of the cotyledonary petiole by at
least 2 mm as the criterion for germination (Janick &
Paull 2008; Baskin & Baskin 2014).
