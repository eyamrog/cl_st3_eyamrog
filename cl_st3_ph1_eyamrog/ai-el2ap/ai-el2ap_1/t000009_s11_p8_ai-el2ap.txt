Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), as primary tools for contemporary
human interaction, should be addressed in CEAP classes due to
their significant impact on social systems, including the facilitation of
globalization and the potential to exacerbate social and economic disparities.
In the field of education, following an extended period of
adaptation, the integration of ICT has begun to yield positive
outcomes. Consequently, in addition to serving as a topic for
discussion, the application of ICT in the design, implementation, and
analysis of language courses is expected to increase in the
near future.
