The implementation of these activities by educators facilitates focused observation
of specific aspects such as pencil grip during drawing, the
position and strength of the fingers while gripping, hand preference
during task execution, as well as levels of concentration and
enjoyment. These activities are informed by a comprehensive review of
Luria's neuropsychological factors, with the objective of analyzing the holistic
development of the child from the perspective of educational sciences.
This approach encompasses the assessment of skills, knowledge, and values
relevant to the developmental stage, thereby guiding the educational process
to ensure quality outcomes and preparing both the child and
their family for subsequent educational transitions.
