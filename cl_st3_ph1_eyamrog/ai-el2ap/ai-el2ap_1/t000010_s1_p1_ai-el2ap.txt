The objective of this research was to examine cultural differences
in the performance of neuropsychological tests among preschool children with
typical development from the provinces of Cienfuegos and Sancti Sp√≠ritus
in Cuba, and to identify the neuropsychological functions associated with
intellectual performance. A total of sixty-seven children were selected and
assigned to groups based on their province of origin. The
Raven's Progressive Matrices Intelligence Test and the Luria Initial Neuropsychological
Battery were administered as assessment instruments. The findings indicated significant
differences in intelligence scores and various neuropsychological functions between the
two provincial groups. Furthermore, the neuropsychological variables associated with intellectual
performance differed according to cultural background. Overall, these results indicate
that cultural factors are associated with distinct patterns of cognitive
skills, which in turn influence the development of intelligence and
neuropsychological functions in preschool-aged children.
