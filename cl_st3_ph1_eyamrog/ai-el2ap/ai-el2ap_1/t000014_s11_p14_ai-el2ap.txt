Most digital archives specializing in language documentation data manage rights
in broadly similar ways, although specific practices differ among archives.
Typically, the original rights holders retain full intellectual and/or cultural
property rights. These rights holders grant non-exclusive licenses to both
the archive and its users, with the terms of these
licenses varying depending on the archive and the relevant copyright
laws of the country in which the archive operates. Commercial
use of the data is uniformly prohibited.
