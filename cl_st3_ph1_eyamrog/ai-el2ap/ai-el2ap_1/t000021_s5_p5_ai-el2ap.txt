Although these strategies are topographically distinct, they serve to adjust
cognition according to situational demands and emotional objectives, thereby reducing
contradictions and dissonance. They modify teachers’ attitudes toward events (Clarà,
2017), which in turn diminishes the emotional impact and its
influence on behavior. For instance, teachers may become more engaged
in the change process by adopting the perspective of their
students. Similarly, positive reappraisal can facilitate closer relationships between teachers
and students. Understanding students’ contexts can enhance teacher empathy, engagement,
and flexibility, which contributes to challenging negative stereotypes (Akbari et
al., 2017; Chang & Daves, 2009; Cross & Hong, 2012),
fosters a more positive perception of the teacher-student relationship (Clarà,
2017), and encourages prosocial behaviors (Gross, 2014). These findings are
consistent with evidence indicating that cognitive modification is associated with
positive emotions, improved relationships, and greater teacher well-being (Chang, 2013;
Clarà, 2017).
