In 1998, Ann María Cetto and Octavio Alonso-Gamboa from the
National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) identified the marginalization of
research from the Global South in major journal indexes (Cetto
& Alonso-Gamboa, 1998). Their analysis revealed that the Web of
Science included only 0.5% of journals from Latin America and
the Caribbean (p. 114). In response to this underrepresentation, Cetto
and Alonso-Gamboa collaborated with regional partners to establish Latindex in
1997, which now indexes 24,486 journals, aiming to address the
exclusion of scholarly output from these regions, which Cetto described
as “the large periphery of the present world system” (1997,
p. 40).
