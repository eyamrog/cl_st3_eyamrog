To address the gap resulting from insufficient training, experienced teachers
highlighted the significance of professional experience in developing both emotional
and pedagogical competencies. In contrast, novice teachers tended to depend
on social support; however, this support was not consistently available,
as many reported limited assistance from colleagues and supervisors. These
results support Sutton's (2004) assertion that teachers primarily acquire skills
for regulating negative emotions through direct classroom experience.
