The cell is 1.2 to 1.3 times longer than broad,
with a deep median constriction and a linear sinus. Semicells
are trapezoidal with a truncate, thickened apex and angles that
are rounded to slightly truncate. The cell wall is smooth.
Each cell contains a single chloroplast, with one pyrenoid present
per semicell. Cell dimensions are as follows: length 26.3–28.7 µm,
width 20.3–22.9 µm, and isthmus 6.7–7.3 µm.
