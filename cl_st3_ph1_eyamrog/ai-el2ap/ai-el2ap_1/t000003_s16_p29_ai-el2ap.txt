Colour was also employed symbolically in various elements, including the
design of football shirts, jackets, and the ribbons for medals
and cups, all of which incorporated the red, yellow, black,
and white of the national flag. FC Lao Rai United
additionally commissioned the weaving of a traditional Timorese tais in
yellow, black, and white, with the clubâ€™s name integrated into
the design. At the conclusion of our interview with club
members, two tais were placed around our necks as a
formal Timorese gesture of appreciation. One of these tais is
depicted in Figure 2 below.
