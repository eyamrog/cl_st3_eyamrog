Given the interpretivist orientation of this analysis and the specific
context of the study—namely, primary science education, scientific discourse, and
the topic of evaporation—an additional analytical framework was necessary during
data examination. Specifically, it was important to establish clear criteria
for what constitutes an explanation in classroom discourse within primary
science. Through an iterative process involving both data and relevant
theoretical perspectives, two structural dimensions were identified: forms of explanation
and causation (Braaten & Windschitl, 2011). Accordingly, the analysis focused
on identifying sequences of utterances that represented instances of explanation
(including definitions, descriptions, and reasoning) as well as causation (accounts
that articulate cause-effect relationships regarding observable events). Identifying such examples
enabled the development of typologies, facilitated detailed commentary and description,
and supported discussion of potential implications.
