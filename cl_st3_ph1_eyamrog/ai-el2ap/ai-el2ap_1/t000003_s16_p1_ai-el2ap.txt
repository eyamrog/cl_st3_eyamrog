The first significant outward migration of Timorese occurred following the
Indonesian invasion and occupation of the eastern region of Timor
in 1975. During this period, individuals and families left the
country as refugees, often with assistance from the International Red
Cross, in search of safety and stability abroad. The majority
of these refugees relocated to Australia or Portugal, while others
sought asylum in countries such as Mozambique, which also had
a history of Portuguese colonization. In the 1990s, during the
final phase of resistance against Indonesian occupation, a considerable number
of Timorese students sought refuge in foreign embassies in Jakarta,
Indonesia, as a result of student-led demonstrations in both Timor
and Indonesia (Fernandes, 2011). Most of these students subsequently relocated
to Portugal, where they received financial support to continue their
studies for several years, and some later migrated to the
United Kingdom as workers.
