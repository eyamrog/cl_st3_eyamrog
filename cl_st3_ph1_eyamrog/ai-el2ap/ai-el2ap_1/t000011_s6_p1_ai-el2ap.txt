Although not previously reported for liana species, our results demonstrate
that dehydration significantly alters the biomechanical properties of both stems
and leaves in the widespread liana Amphilophium curcigerum (L.) L.G.Lohmann
(Bignoniaceae), specifically increasing stem bending stiffness and leaf fracture toughness.
The observed increase in bending stiffness renders liana stems more
susceptible to rupture by reducing their capacity for flexion and
torsion. Furthermore, maintaining sample moisture following field collection is essential
for obtaining accurate estimates of biomechanical properties, as discussed below.
