The Linguistics Area digital archive currently holds records for 80
indigenous languages, of which 73 have been fully digitized, catalogued,
and stored using the LAT software. The LAT files occupy
2.49 TB of storage and comprise 1,561 hours of audio
and 474 hours of video recordings. In addition to these,
the archive contains 9 TB of raw recordings, including high-definition
video, which require substantial storage capacity. Edited materials, primarily intended
for community use, account for an additional 1.5 TB, while
photographs and miscellaneous researcher files occupy a further 6 TB.
Metadata for the LAT files is accessible at http://arqling.museu-goeldi.br. The
recordings themselves are not currently available for download, as the
archive is undergoing reorganization and access issues are being addressed.
