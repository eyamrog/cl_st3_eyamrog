Although numerous approaches exist for analyzing discursive data and interaction,
it can be argued that all share the underlying assumption
that researchers must engage in repeated and thorough reflection on
the data in order to fragment and manipulate it in
the search for underlying patterns and meanings (Evans, 2013, p.
158). The extent to which the data is fragmented often
determines whether quantitative or qualitative methods are employed. Furthermore, it
is generally recognized that, when analyzing discursive interaction, researchers typically
reach a stage at which they categorize or code an
utterance, turn of speech, or episode (Hennessy et al., 2020).
