Eleven questions were designed to collect data on the authors’
social, academic, and scientific backgrounds, as well as their perspectives
on the influence of various contextual factors in the publication
process of high-impact journals. A total of thirty-eight authors participated
in this phase, representing 29.92% of the invited experts, which
exceeds the minimum threshold of 10–20% considered sufficient for a
reliable data sample, as established by Oliveira and Grácio (2005).
