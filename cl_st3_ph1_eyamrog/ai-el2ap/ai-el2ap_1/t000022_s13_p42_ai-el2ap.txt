In the absence of data on inter-institutional collaboration, the analysis
of inter-state collaboration in Brazil provides an important perspective on
the patterns of collaboration depicted in Figure 6. As previously
noted, 79.6% of the articles in the OLIVA database with
Brazilian authors are authored exclusively by individuals from Brazil, a
proportion higher than that observed in other countries such as
Argentina (48.3%), Chile (52.7%), and Mexico (56.5%). The documents analyzed
in this section (SciELO 2016-2020) indicate that, when Brazilian authors
are involved, 41% of the cases involve collaboration between authors
from different states, with 31.9% involving two states and 9.1%
involving three or more states. The remaining 59% of cases,
which involve only within-state collaboration, is comparable to the proportion
of exclusively within-country collaboration observed in the aforementioned Spanish-speaking countries.
