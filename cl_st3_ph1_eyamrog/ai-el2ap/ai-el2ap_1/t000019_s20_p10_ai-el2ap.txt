While it is important to acknowledge DICT as an integral
component of contemporary human culture, it is a separate matter
to present them as singular solutions to social problems that
originate from specific socio-historical contexts. Such an approach risks implying
that technological artefacts are capable of resolving these issues independently
and, furthermore, that interactions with these technologies invariably yield positive
outcomes.
