The results indicate that W. cyathiformis plants (Table 2) relocated
as either terricolous or epiphytic did not exhibit significant differences
in survival rates, suggesting that the method of relocation did
not affect survival for this species during the experimental period.
However, survival rates for both relocation forms declined significantly over
time, stabilizing at 60% from 252 days until the conclusion
of the experiment (Table 2). This pattern suggests that W.
cyathiformis experiences stress after 196 days post-transplantation until final establishment.
Jasper et al. (2005) reported a mean survival rate of
67% for 14 bromeliad species relocated following forest clearing for
hydroelectric development, with species-specific survival ranging from 79% to 50%
over a 10-month period. Barrancos et al. (2016) found that
the survival rate of the tank bromeliad Werauhia gladioliflora (H.
Wendl.) J. R. Grant, attached to trunks and branches, varied
between 65% and 95% across sites after nine months, although
their evaluation period was shorter than in the present study
(12.4 months). Similarly, Duarte and Gandolfi (2013) observed a survival
rate of 75.9% for Aechmea bromeliifolia (Rudge) Baker one year
after epiphytic relocation. The vulnerability of epiphytes following relocation is
likely attributable to their reliance on rainfall for water uptake,
as they do not receive supplemental irrigation (Benzing 2000), resulting
in frequent exposure to drought conditions. For example, Carvalho et
al. (2017) demonstrated a 37% reduction in relative water content
(RWC) in Guzmania monostachia (L.) Rusby ex Mez plants subjected
to eight days without irrigation, a response comparable to the
effects observed in the present study.
