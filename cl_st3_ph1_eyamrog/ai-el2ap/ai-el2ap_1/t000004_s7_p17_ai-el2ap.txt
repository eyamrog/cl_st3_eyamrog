Sophie, a French national who has resided in Leeds for
an extended period, has a longstanding interest in Brazilian culture
and the Portuguese language that extends beyond her dedicated involvement
in capoeira. She is recognized as one of the more
proficient capoeiristas in the class, and Sandro frequently selects her
to demonstrate movements for the group, either with himself or
with Tiago, an experienced capoeirista from Mozambique. A former Brazilian
partner questioned her motivation for learning the non-standard variety of
Brazilian Portuguese that she was acquiring through her capoeira practice.
