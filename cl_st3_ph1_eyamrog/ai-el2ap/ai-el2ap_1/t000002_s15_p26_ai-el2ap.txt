Such analysis is typically demonstrated through selected extracts accompanied by
commentary that draws on existing knowledge of the field and
context. It often focuses on the syntax and cohesive structure
of language to examine how knowledge is socially constructed in
classroom settings (Mercer, 2004). Since the dialogue remains unaltered during
analysis, the resulting typologies serve as heuristic tools for interpreting
classroom talk in relation to specific issues (Mercer, 2004). For
example, Mercer’s research identified three types of group talk—disputational, cumulative,
and exploratory—and found that exploratory talk has a positive effect
on student learning. Therefore, the aim is not to reduce
the data to simple categorical counts, but rather to identify
broad features that encompass both the context and the discursive
dynamics relevant to educational learning objectives (Mercer et al., 2004).
The following subsection presents an example of the types of
research questions and findings that sociocultural discourse analysis can yield.
