The economic distribution of JUOJS was examined according to the
four World Bank income groups (Figure 4). Based on gross
national income (GNI) per capita, 81.1% of JUOJS are located
in middle-income countries, while the 27 low-income countries account for
only 53 JUOJS (0.2%). Overall, 81.6% of the journals originate
from countries classified by national income as part of the
Global South (Haug, 2021). From a geopolitical standpoint, using the
five United Nations Regional Groups, 78.1% of JUOJS are situated
in three UN regional groups commonly associated with the Global
South (Dados & Connell, 2012): Asia-Pacific States (54.7%), Latin American
and Caribbean States (21%), and African States (2.4%) (Figure 5).
