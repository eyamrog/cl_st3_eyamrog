With respect to executive functions and other abilities associated with
frontal lobe development, Ardila et al. (1995) identified parental socioeconomic
status as a potential factor contributing to group differences. However,
the literature presents mixed findings regarding its impact on Cuban
child development; while some studies report no significant effect (Jiménez-Colín
et al., 2018), others suggest that socioeconomic status does play
a role (Mora & Anangonó, 2016).
