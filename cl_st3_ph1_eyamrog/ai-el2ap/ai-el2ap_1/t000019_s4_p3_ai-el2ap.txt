The BNCC presents these technologies as primary solutions to the
challenges facing Brazilian education. However, rather than being integrated as
part of the cumulative knowledge developed by humanity, their inclusion
is shaped by specific interests, particularly those driven by market
forces, which may not align with the Brazilian socio-economic context.
The recommendations primarily emphasize the provision of teaching tools, which
should represent only one component of the broader knowledge base
to be conveyed to students in the field of ICT.
Furthermore, the BNCC does not specify the timing or allocation
of investments in school technological infrastructure, nor does it address
the training of teachers to effectively utilize digital technologies at
the required level. Additionally, it does not ensure that students
will have internet access at home.
