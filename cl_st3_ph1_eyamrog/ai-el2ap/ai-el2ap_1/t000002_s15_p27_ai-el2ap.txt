The data for this study were obtained from a previous
project involving a classroom-based intervention designed to promote dialogue. The
second module of the teacher professional development (TPD) program utilized
predefined classroom materials that emphasized student discussion and reasoning, enabling
students to construct their own explanations of water evaporation through
observation and reference to everyday experiences (SPRinG, n.d.).
