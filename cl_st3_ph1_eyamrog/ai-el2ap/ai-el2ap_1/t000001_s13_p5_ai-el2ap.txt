ONT library preparation methods, sequencing chemistry, and basecalling algorithms are
also significant factors influencing sequencing outcomes. Both ligation-based and rapid
library preparation protocols are suitable for bacterial whole-genome sequencing; however,
ligation-based preparations typically yield higher sequencing output, whereas rapid preparations
tend to produce longer reads. ONT currently provides MinION and
GridION flow cells with two pore types: R9.4.1, introduced in
2017, and R10.4.1, released in 2022. The R10.4.1 flow cells
incorporate longer pores, which enhance homopolymer resolution and consensus sequence
accuracy, making them preferable for genome assembly. Basecalling, which involves
converting raw electrical signals from the sequencer into nucleotide sequences,
is subject to ongoing improvements; therefore, it is recommended to
use the latest version of ONTâ€™s basecalling software with the
highest-accuracy model available. If an ONT sequencer equipped with a
GPU (such as a GridION) is not available, access to
a separate computer with a GPU is necessary to perform
basecalling efficiently.
