For experienced members, data collection commonly involves the use of
questionnaires, interviews, and field observations to identify the genres that
students are likely to encounter in the target context, as
well as the specific English language skills they need to
develop (cf. Sarmento, 2012). In contrast, genre analysis primarily focuses
on texts that are produced and utilized within the community.
This analysis can be conducted from a textual perspective, which
examines the linguistic and rhetorical features characteristic of the target
genre(s) (cf. Cheng, 2008), or from an intertextual perspective, which
seeks to identify the genre system through which community members
perform their activities (cf. Molle & Prior, 2008).
