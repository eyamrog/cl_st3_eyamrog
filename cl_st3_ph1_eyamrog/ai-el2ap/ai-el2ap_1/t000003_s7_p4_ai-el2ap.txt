The theoretical framework for this research is informed by scholarship
in multilingualism, the sociolinguistics of globalization, anthropological studies of migration
and diaspora, and recent sociological literature on mobilities and mooring.
The following section reviews intersecting theoretical developments across these fields
and highlights the concepts most pertinent to the study. The
third section outlines the broad temporal and spatial patterns of
transnational migration from Timor-Leste, with particular attention to recent movements
to Northern Ireland. The fourth section details the research methodology,
including the ethnographic, textual, and photographic data collected. The fifth
section examines the diverse backgrounds and migration trajectories of the
study participants, as well as the evolution of their communicative
repertoires. The sixth section provides an in-depth analysis of local
settlement and employment conditions. The seventh section focuses on nine
football clubs, analyzing the use of linguistic and semiotic resources
in their naming, organization, and branding, and discusses how club
organizers and managers utilize cultural resources and various forms of
knowledge. This section also addresses the complex processes of identification
within the sports context and the multiple local representations of
Timorese identity. The final two sections present reflections on the
significance of the findings generated by the research to date.
