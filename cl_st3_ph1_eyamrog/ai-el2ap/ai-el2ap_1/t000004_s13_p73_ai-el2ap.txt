During the game, which is conducted non-verbally, players attempt to
identify and exploit unguarded areas on their opponent’s body. For
example, a player may target the exposed abdomen of an
opponent performing an aú (cartwheel) with a cabeçada, or attempt
to sweep the opponent’s leg while they are executing a
kick. In contrast to many other martial arts, capoeira emphasizes
evasion of attacks rather than blocking them. Typically, an experienced
capoeirista is adept at moving in a manner that minimizes
the exposure of vital areas, requiring their opponent to execute
multiple maneuvers before a viable opportunity for attack arises.
