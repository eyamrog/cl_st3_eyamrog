Further research is required to assess the tolerance of C.
alba seeds and pyrenes to prolonged water immersion in order
to determine whether the observed increase in germination is maintained
over time. Rapid and high germination rates following flooding may
represent an important trait for sustaining monodominance, as the majority
of buried propagules are recruited at the conclusion of the
seasonal flooding period in the Pantanal wetlands (Bao et al.
2018).
