The organization of legacy materials can be challenging when objects
such as field notes or audio tapes lack sufficient metadata,
and when specialists capable of interpreting the language or content
are unavailable. Furthermore, some materials may exist in obsolete or
inaccessible formats, such as analog reel-to-reel tapes commonly used between
the 1950s and 1970s, a period significant for language documentation.
In such cases, it may be advantageous to collaborate with
community members who can assist in interpreting the materials or
to prioritize digitization, either through an external professional audio technician
or as part of an archival donation process. The primary
objective at this stage is to create a basic inventory
of the materials, detailing the quantity and type of objects
(e.g., number of notebooks, tapes) prior to their transfer, thereby
ensuring that all items can be accounted for upon arrival
at their destination. In the absence of metadata, alternative descriptions
of the physical characteristics of the objects (e.g., “two tapes
with red design on cover”) should be provided.
