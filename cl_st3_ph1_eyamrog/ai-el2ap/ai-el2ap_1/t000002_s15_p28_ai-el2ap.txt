This study aimed to investigate the ways in which classroom
discourse supports studentsâ€™ scientific understanding. The underlying assumption was that
a significant portion of conceptual learning in primary science is
achieved through the construction of explanations. Accordingly, the focus of
the research was to examine and analyze how teachers and
students collaboratively construct scientific explanations of evaporation through classroom talk.
