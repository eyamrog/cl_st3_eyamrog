The A. distichantha and W. cyathiformis plants selected for relocation
exhibited an average of 19.61 and 13.65 leaves, respectively, and
were in good phytosanitary condition. Relocation was conducted in November
2015, coinciding with the period of highest rainfall, as recommended
by Lunelli et al. (2015). For epiphytic relocation, bromeliads were
attached to tree trunks or branch forks, irrespective of tree
species, following the methodology described by Jasper et al. (2005).
Trained fieldworkers used ladders to access higher branches and secured
the plants with sisal string to prevent dislodgement. All relocated
bromeliads were labeled with numbered plastic tags for identification. For
terrestrial relocation, bromeliads were removed from pots and transplanted into
holes within the crown projection area of the corresponding trees,
with soil compacted around the base to ensure stability. In
total, 30 individuals of each species were relocated as terrestrials
and 30 as epiphytes, resulting in 60 relocated plants per
species. As illustrated in Figure 4, A. distichantha was relocated
both as a terrestrial (Figure 4a) and as an epiphyte
(Figures 4b and 4c), while W. cyathiformis was similarly relocated
as a terrestrial (Figure 5a) and as an epiphyte (Figure
5b). The allocation of specimens was randomized to reflect standard
field procedures used by technicians during rescue and relocation operations,
without regard to the presence of sprouts, inflorescences, or size
variation, and without distinguishing between reproductive and vegetative stages. Following
random allocation, the distribution of A. distichantha in the reproductive
stage was 20% (12 plants) among epiphytes and 21.7% (13
plants) among terrestrials, while in the vegetative stage, 30% (18
plants) were relocated as epiphytes and 28.3% (17 plants) as
terrestrials, based on a total of 60 relocated individuals.
