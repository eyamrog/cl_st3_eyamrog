In Cuba, research has primarily focused on characterizing preschool children
with typical development as well as those in clinical populations
(Prieto et al., 2020); however, there is a lack of
studies comparing neuropsychological performance across different provinces. Such comparative studies
could inform the development of stimulation strategies tailored to the
specific characteristics and cultural contexts of each province.
