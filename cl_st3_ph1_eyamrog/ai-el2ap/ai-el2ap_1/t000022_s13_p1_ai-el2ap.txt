The OLIVA database, compiled from the Redalyc and SciELO collections,
comprises 908,982 document records from 1,720 journals published between 1909
and May 2019 (see Table 1). Articles constitute the predominant
document type, accounting for 87% of the records, although this
proportion varies across subject areas. The average number of authors
per document is 3.1, and per article is 3.3. Since
multiple authorship is more prevalent in the Exact and Natural
Sciences, Engineering, and Biological Sciences, these data suggest that the
database encompasses a wide disciplinary range. While it may be
assumed that journals published in the region primarily use vernacular
languages and are therefore concentrated in the Social Sciences and
Humanities, subsequent analysis will demonstrate that the corpus is multilingual.
