Cosmarium pseudoconnatum is morphologically very similar to Cosmarium connatum Brébisson
ex Ralfs, with the primary distinguishing feature being the presence
of four chloroplasts in each semicell of C. pseudoconnatum, compared
to two in C. connatum. According to Scott and Grönblad
(1957), the cell walls of both species are identical, exhibiting
a scrobiculate surface with easily visible pores located between the
scrobicules.
