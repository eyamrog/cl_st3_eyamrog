Certain bacterial taxa have experienced an expansion of insertion sequence
elements during their evolution, leading to genomes that contain hundreds
of 1–2 kbp repeat sequences. Accurate assembly of these genomes
is challenging because short-read polishing tools often have difficulty correcting
errors within high-copy-number repeats (Figure 2B). Therefore, it is important
to maximise the accuracy of assemblies generated using Oxford Nanopore
Technologies (ONT) data alone by employing high ONT sequencing depth,
R10.4.1 flow cells, ‘super’ basecalling, and Medaka polishing, thereby reducing
the number of errors that remain for short-read polishing. Furthermore,
the use of mate-pair Illumina sequencing may facilitate the correction
of errors within repeat regions by Polypolish, as it can
decrease the frequency of ambiguous short-read alignments.
