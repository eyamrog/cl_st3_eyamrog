Although a game of capoeira may initially appear to be
an improvised activity, it is, in fact, a highly organized
event in which each participant assumes specific roles. These roles
are determined by the traditions of each school and may
exhibit minor variations; however, the overall structure is consistent across
different schools and styles.
