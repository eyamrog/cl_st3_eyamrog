Plants terrestrial, forming dense thickets. Rhizomes long-creeping, bearing filiform hairs.
Leaves 1.5–4.5 m long; stipes 0.75–2.5 m long, dark brown
proximally and stramineous distally, glabrous throughout. Laminae 0.75–2.5 m long,
proximally 3–4-pinnate-pinnatifid; rachises stramineous and glabrous. Basal pinnae 60–100 ×
25–70 cm, equilateral; pinnae and pinnules distally with free lobes
between segments. Compound distal segments inequilateral, irregularly dissected, and caudate
at the apex; simple distal segments linear, up to 3(–4)
cm long. Costae abaxially with reddish, catenate hairs and adaxially
glabrous; costules abaxially with reddish, catenate hairs and adaxially glabrous.
Veins abaxially lanose, with loose, arachnoid hairs, and adaxially glabrous.
Laminar tissue between veins glabrous on both surfaces. Sori marginal,
linear, located along segment margins and borne at the tips
of multiple veins; inner indusia vestigial; outer indusia linear.
