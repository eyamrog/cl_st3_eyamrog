All members of the core group possessed modest material resources
at the time they decided to migrate north. These resources
were sufficient to cover the cost of a long-haul flight
from Timor-Leste to Europe, as well as their living expenses
while seeking employment. For instance, MFB had worked in an
Indonesian bank during the Indonesian occupation (1975–1999) and subsequently with
a non-governmental organization following Independence in 2002 (Interview with MFB,
June 2015). CX had been employed as a male nurse
with Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) during the three-year United Nations
administration (1999–2002) and later worked for the national health service
in Timor-Leste after Independence (Interview with CX, June 2015). DA
had worked as a driver for a government department after
Independence (Interview with DA, June 2015). AX had been employed
as a porter in a warehouse in Dili, where he
carried sacks of rice, and had also worked as a
construction laborer.
