In subsequent years, additional equipment was acquired and further documentation
projects were undertaken. As the Goeldi Linguistics Area archive developed,
technological advancements led to changes in formats and physical media.
The conversion of all recordings to standardized digital formats has
addressed issues related to longevity and compatibility. Certain devices, such
as microphones, remain functional and are not subject to obsolescence,
while various types of recorders (e.g., DAT, mini-DV) that are
no longer used for active documentation are retained to facilitate
access to legacy recordings and enable their digitization. Original recordings
are preserved on their original media and stored in professional
storage cabinets.
