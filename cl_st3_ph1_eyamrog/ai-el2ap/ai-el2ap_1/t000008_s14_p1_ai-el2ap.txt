Seed Collection and Processing – Fresh, mature, black fruits were
collected directly from 15 Copernicia alba Morong individuals within a
natural population along the Carandazal trail (Fig. 1a), located in
the Miranda subregion of the Pantanal wetland, Mato Grosso do
Sul State, Brazil (GPS coordinates: 19º48’30.1’’S, 57º10’13.5’’W) in July 2011.
Fruit maturity was determined by the presence of a black
exocarp. Harvesting was performed by cutting outer branches and dislodging
fruit bunches using a tree pruner, allowing the fruits to
fall onto plastic sheeting placed on the ground. The collected
fruits were transported to the Seed Laboratory at Universidade Federal
do Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, for further
processing. The exocarp and mesocarp were removed manually by friction,
and the resulting pyrenes were examined for signs of fungal
infection and insect damage. All seeds were combined into a
single lot. The mature fruit is characterized as a dry,
fibrous drupe with an ovoid shape and black coloration, comprising
an exocarp, a fibrous mesocarp, and a stony endocarp that
encloses the seeds (pyrenes), which measure 1–2 cm in length
(Fig. 1b–d). Due to the presence of a thick, rigid
endocarp, the entire pyrene was used as the germination unit
in this study. The initial moisture content of the pyrenes
was determined by weighing two samples of 15 pyrenes each,
followed by oven-drying at 105 ± 3°C for 24 hours,
in accordance with Brazilian seed testing regulations (Brasil 2009). After
processing and initial moisture assessment, a sublot of cleaned pyrenes
was placed in a paper bag and stored in a
dry cold room at 19°C (45 ± 5% relative humidity)
for one year to evaluate viability through germination testing after
the storage period.
