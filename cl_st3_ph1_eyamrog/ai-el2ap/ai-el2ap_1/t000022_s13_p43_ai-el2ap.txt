Collaboration has been a fundamental factor contributing to the significant
increase in publications by Brazilian authors in recent decades. Sidone,
Haddad, and Mena-Chalco (2016) demonstrated that institutions located in the
Southeastern states, particularly SÃ£o Paulo, have played a central role
in facilitating both intra- and inter-regional collaborations within Brazil. While
these states maintain their central position, recent years have seen
a notable rise in collaborative activities among institutions in other
states, both within the same region and across different regions,
with this trend being especially pronounced in the Northeast and
South.
