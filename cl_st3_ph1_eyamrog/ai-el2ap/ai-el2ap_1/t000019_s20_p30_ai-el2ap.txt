An additional factor influencing the feasibility of pedagogical use of
DICT is the consistent presence of a multidisciplinary team, typically
comprising at least a computer technician and a pedagogical facilitator.
From 2006 to 2013, the position of computer technician was
established in the State of Goi√°s, although its implementation varied
across Brazil. The primary responsibility of these professionals was to
support teachers in computer laboratories, particularly in integrating ICT into
pedagogical practices and disciplinary content (Bueno, 2017; Brito, 2008). In
most schools, the facilitator role was filled by a teacher
from any subject area, resulting in a multitasking profile; however,
in some municipalities, this position was occupied by a computer
technician. The broad range of duties assigned to these individuals
often limited their ability to focus on pedagogical functions, a
challenge that was exacerbated when the facilitator did not possess
a background in education.
