If automation is required, modifications to the workflow are necessary.
Flye19 is less likely than other long-read assemblers to generate
large-scale errors that cannot be corrected by downstream polishing tools,
making it a suitable alternative to Trycycler. Prior to polishing
with Medaka, circular Flye contigs should be rotated to either
a consistent starting sequence (such as dnaA36) or a random
starting sequence. This step relocates any duplicated or missing bases
from the termini of circular contigs to the middle of
the sequence, where polishing tools are more effective at correcting
such errors. For short-read polishing, the use of Polypolish followed
by POLCA is recommended, as these tools have the lowest
likelihood of introducing additional errors.
