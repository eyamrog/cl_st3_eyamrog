Data archiving supports collaboration at multiple levels. For researchers collaborating
remotely with speech communities or other researchers, archiving data as
they are generated or as analyses are completed enables the
project team to maintain organization and consistency. Once data are
systematically organized and archived, they become accessible to other researchers,
potentially leading to new collaborative opportunities. Furthermore, data archiving facilitates
the reuse of primary data for a range of research
purposes, including work in natural language processing and linguistic typology.
Archived data can also be cited, which is essential for
ensuring research reproducibility (Berez-Kroeker et al., 2018). Some journals, such
as Language Documentation & Conservation, require that datasets associated with
articles be archived and cited appropriately. Therefore, researchers are encouraged
to cite their own archived data, and it is necessary
for others who use these data to provide proper citation
as well.
