Throughout this article, the term "archive" refers to a repository
of materials that are collected, saved, and preserved by an
organization or institution for potential reuse in the present and
future. An archive may contain analog materials, digital materials (including
both born-digital and digitized content), or a combination of both.
A digital repository is defined as an archive that specifically
stores digital materials or records, while a (digital) language archive
is an archive that focuses on linguistic cultural heritage and
language-related materials or data. In the field of language documentation,
a widely cited definition of an archive is provided by
Johnson (2004, p. 142): “An archive is a trusted repository
created and maintained by an institution with a demonstrated commitment
to permanence and the long-term preservation of archived resources.” Johnson’s
definition does not explicitly address the digital aspect, so a
more recent definition by Trevor Owens, Head of Digital Content
Management at the US Library of Congress, is also considered.
Owens (2018, p. 4) clarifies that a repository is not
merely a software solution, but rather encompasses financial resources, hardware,
staff time, and the ongoing implementation of policies and planning
to ensure long-term access to content; he emphasizes that any
software used for digital preservation is inherently temporary, whereas institutional
commitment enables preservation. In this article, the terms "archive" and
"repository" are used interchangeably. Both definitions highlight recurring themes such
as institutional involvement, commitment, ongoing processes, long-term perspective, and preservation.
These themes will be discussed further in this section, with
particular emphasis on the necessity of sustained institutional commitment for
the creation and maintenance of an archive.
