Duarte and Gandolfi (2013) reported that the size of bromeliad
specimens selected for relocation may affect their survival rates, with
larger individuals of Aechmea bromeliifolia (Rudge) Baker demonstrating greater resistance
to transplantation stress and higher persistence in the environment. In
the present study, bromeliad size was not explicitly considered; however,
only adult specimens were selected for relocation, and smaller plants
were excluded. The average number of leaves, 19.61 for A.
distichantha and 13.65 for W. cyathiformis, was used as an
indicator of the growth stage. Since sprouting typically occurs when
individuals reach the adult stage, these findings suggest that selecting
A. distichantha and W. cyathiformis specimens with sprouts may enhance
relocation success, as these plants are likely to have achieved
sufficient development to tolerate transplantation stress.
