The Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) is an independent
organization supported by libraries, publishers, and other stakeholders, which evaluates
and includes journals based on a comprehensive assessment of their
compliance with established scholarly standards. The Directory of Open Access
Scholarly Resources is managed by the International Center for the
Registration of Serial Publications, which oversees ISSN (International Standard Serial
Number) registration and incorporates data from various sources, including DOAJ,
Latindex, and Scopus. This integration of multiple data sources results
in a higher number of journals indexed by the Directory
of Open Access Scholarly Resources and, consequently, a greater number
of JUOJS entries.
