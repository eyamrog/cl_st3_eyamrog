Data analysis followed the methodology outlined by Aaker and Day
(1990), which involves conducting nominal and ordinal analyses of tabulated
data. Nominal analysis was used to identify the personal, academic,
and professional characteristics of the participants, while ordinal analysis focused
on examining the frequency of recurring features among respondents. The
online format of the questionnaire enabled automatic data tabulation, and
Microsoft Word and Excel were utilized for data description, analysis,
and the creation of tables and charts.
