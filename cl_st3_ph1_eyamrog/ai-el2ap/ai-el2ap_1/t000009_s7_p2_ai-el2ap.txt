The emergence of information and communication technologies (ICT) at the
turn of the century has significantly transformed various social systems,
including education (Warschauer, 2002). The integration of ICT into teaching
and learning processes has had diverse impacts on educational systems
worldwide, initially resulting in disruption and instability. Hara and Kling
(2000) examined the effects of ICT on students and identified
lack of timely feedback and technical difficulties as primary sources
of frustration in a web-based distance language course in the
United States. From the perspective of teachers, Lam (2000) found
that ten language teachers interviewed in Canada attributed the challenges
they faced to institutional pressures to adopt technological innovations without
providing sufficient preparation or training for educators. At the institutional
level, Karagiorgi (2005) documented the difficulties encountered in implementing ICT
across several elementary schools in Cyprus.
