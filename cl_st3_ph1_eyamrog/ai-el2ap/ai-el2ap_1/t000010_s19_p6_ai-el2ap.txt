Although neuropsychological variables are present in both provinces studied, specific
differences were identified that are relevant to the research. In
the province of Sancti Sp√≠ritus, fine motor skills (t =
2.059, p = 0.048), drawing denomination (t = -2.890, p
= 0.007), and speed with the right upper limb (t
= 3.477, p = 0.001) were found to be significant
predictors of intellectual performance in preschool children. The predictive value
for each of these variables ranged from 0.089 to 0.252
(see Table 3). In contrast, the same neuropsychological tasks did
not serve as predictors of intelligence development in the Cienfuegos
group.
