The cell is approximately 1.4 times longer than broad, with
a pronounced median constriction and a linear sinus. Semicells are
quadrate, with the apex ranging from retuse to slightly truncate,
parallel lateral margins, concave apical angles, and rounded basal angles.
The cell wall is smooth, containing a single chloroplast and
one pyrenoid per semicell. Cell dimensions are approximately as follows:
length 22.8 µm, width 15.8 µm, and isthmus 5.1 µm.
