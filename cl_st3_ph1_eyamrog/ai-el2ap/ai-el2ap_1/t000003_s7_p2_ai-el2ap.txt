This paper examines the social world of sport, specifically focusing
on nine football clubs established for men and boys within
a small-town context. The analysis addresses three key aspects of
the social, cultural, and semiotic practices emerging around football in
this setting: (1) the linguistic, cultural, and semiotic practices involved
in the naming and branding of the clubs, which reflect
various Timorese identities associated with different regions of Timor-Leste as
well as connections to globalized football cultures; (2) the language
resources utilized by Timorese club managers—including Tetum, Portuguese, and English—alongside
their organizational practices, ethos, and knowledge bases; and (3) the
significance of scheduling football tournaments to coincide with important dates
in the history of Timor-Leste, a recurring practice that demonstrates
an orientation toward a shared national identity.
