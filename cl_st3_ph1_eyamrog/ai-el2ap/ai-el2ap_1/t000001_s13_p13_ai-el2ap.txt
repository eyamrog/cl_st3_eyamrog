The preceding steps have produced a long-read-only assembly with high
accuracy, estimated at approximately Q50 (one error per 100,000 base
pairs) when R10.4.1 Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) reads are utilized.
The final step involves correcting any residual errors using short-read
data. For instance, long homopolymer regions are challenging for ONT
sequencing to accurately resolve; however, Illumina sequencing does not exhibit
this limitation. Consequently, homopolymer-length errors that remain after long-read polishing
can be corrected through short-read polishing.
