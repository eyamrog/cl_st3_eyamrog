At the conclusion of all germination trials, we determined the
germination percentage (G%) and mean germination time (MGT) based on
the daily count of germinated pyrenes, following the methodologies described
by Labouriau (1983) and Ranal and Santana (2006). Additionally, the
germination speed index was calculated according to Maguire (1962). Non-germinated
pyrenes were categorized as either dormant or dead; however, seed
viability was not assessed using a tetrazolium test. Seeds classified
as dormant or dead were excluded from the data analysis.
