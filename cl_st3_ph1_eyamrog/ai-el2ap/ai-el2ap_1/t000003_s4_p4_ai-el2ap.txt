Fourth, the dual focus on mobility and the processes and
practices involved in mooring allows for a more balanced perspective
in migration studies by complementing accounts of detachment, dislocation, and
precarious positioning with detailed analyses of the specific ways in
which moorings and re-moorings are established, thereby highlighting the agency
of the individuals involved. Furthermore, careful examination of the linguistic,
cultural, and other semiotic practices of particular groups, such as
the football clubs discussed in this study, facilitates a deeper
understanding of the complex mechanisms through which local forms of
mooring activity acquire multiple layers of social meaning.
