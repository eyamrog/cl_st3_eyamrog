Recent publications have reviewed methods for analyzing classroom dialogue (Kershner,
Hennessy, et al., 2020; Kumpulainen et al., 2009; MÃ¤rtsin, 2012).
In response to the growing body of research in this
area, the present discussion paper aims to critically examine the
methodologies and methods used to analyze classroom discursive interaction. Rather
than immediately addressing specific analytical methods, the paper first provides
a comprehensive methodological overview, beginning with a discussion of research
paradigms that incorporates considerations of epistemology and ontology. The second
section of the paper presents methods and procedures for discursive
data analysis, distinguishing between quantitative and qualitative approaches. Both approaches
are discussed and exemplified using cases from previous research.
