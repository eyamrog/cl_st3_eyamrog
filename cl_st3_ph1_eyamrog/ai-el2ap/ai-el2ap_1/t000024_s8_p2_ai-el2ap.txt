Among epiphytes, Bromeliaceae species have been identified as ecologically significant
within their native ecosystems and are considered suitable candidates for
relocation (Jasper et al. 2005; Duarte & Gandolfi 2013). Certain
morphological features of bromeliads, such as the overlapping of leaf
bases that form cisterns or phytotelmata, facilitate the accumulation and
storage of water and nutrients, which are accessible to small
animals (Benzing 2000). Stuntz et al. (2002) reported that the
evaporation of water from bromeliad cisterns can alter the behavior
and niche distribution of arboreal fauna, thereby influencing canopy microclimate
conditions by contributing to lower local temperatures. Additionally, bromeliads provide
other ecological resources, including flowers, fruits, and nectar, to their
surrounding environment (Benzing 2004; Cestari 2009).
