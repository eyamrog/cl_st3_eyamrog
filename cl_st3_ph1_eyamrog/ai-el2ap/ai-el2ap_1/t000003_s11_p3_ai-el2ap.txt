Throughout most of the twentieth century, research in the sociolinguistics
of multilingualism primarily focused on documenting patterns of language use
within local communities, which were typically conceptualized as stable, homogeneous,
and clearly bounded entities. Pratt (1987, p. 60) was among
the first to advocate for a shift away from this
community-centered perspective, proposing instead a "linguistics of contact." She argued
that this approach would prioritize the analysis of interactions and
contact zones between dominant and subordinate groups, individuals with diverse
and multiple identities, and speakers of different languages.
