The fracture toughness of mature leaves of A. crucigerum (mean
206 ± 53 J m⁻²) was at least three times
lower than the values reported for mature leaves of other
dicotyledonous species (Lucas & Pereira 1990), but was similar to
those observed in Piper kadzura, Morus australis, and Trema orientalis
(Hill & Lucas 1996). This lower fracture toughness may be
attributed to differences in leaf anatomy and thickness. Previous studies
have shown that fracture toughness increases with leaf thickness and
fiber content, but decreases with a higher proportion of parenchyma
cells in the mesophyll (Vincent 1990a; Lucas et al. 1995;
Darvell et al. 1996). In the present study, the leaf
lamina of A. crucigerum was found to be thin and
predominantly composed of parenchyma cells, as illustrated in Figure 1,
which likely contributed to the lower fracture toughness observed in
this species.
