Rhizomes are erect or, less commonly, short-creeping, and may occasionally
form small trunks; they are dictyostelic and bear peltate scales.
Leaves are monomorphic, with stipes containing an omega-shaped vascular strand.
Laminae are 1- to 4-pinnate, and veins are free. The
indument consists primarily of caduceus scales, with scattered catenate hairs
occurring rarely. Sori are marginal or submarginal, discrete, and extrorse,
and are protected by both outer (unmodified) and inner (modified)
indusia. Spores are tetrahedral-globose and trilete (Smith et al. 2006).
