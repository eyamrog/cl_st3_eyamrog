In addition to annual tournaments, individual clubs organize friendly matches
with Timorese teams located in other regions of the United
Kingdom. For example, in 2014, the FC Lao Rai United
football team expanded its schedule to include a friendly match
in Northwich, near Manchester, with a Timorese team based in
that area. Since then, additional friendly matches and tournaments have
taken place in locations such as Oxford and Peterborough. Photographs
and video recordings of these matches, as well as the
subsequent celebrations, are regularly posted on social media platforms such
as Facebook and YouTube. These materials are viewed and commented
on—primarily in Tetum—by friends and family members in Timor-Leste, as
well as by members of the Timorese diaspora in the
United Kingdom, Portugal, South Korea, and Australia. Football is a
popular sport in Timor-Leste, which has a national team; as
previously noted, a former member of this team was playing
for FC Lao Rai in Dungannon during the period of
our research. Although football is also played in local schools
in Timor-Leste, there are limited resources available to support the
organization of regional teams. Matches involving leading European football clubs,
such as the national team of Portugal or prominent UK
clubs like Manchester United, are accessible via television or online
in Timor-Leste, and supporting specific football teams has become increasingly
popular.
