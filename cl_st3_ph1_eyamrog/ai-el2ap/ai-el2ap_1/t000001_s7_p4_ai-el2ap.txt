In this study, we present a contemporary method for generating
a high-quality bacterial genome assembly by integrating Oxford Nanopore Technologies
(ONT) long reads with Illumina short reads (Figure 1). These
sequencing platforms were selected due to their accessibility and widespread
use in microbial genomics. Previous hybrid assembly strategies typically employed
a short-read-first approach, wherein a short-read assembly graph was constructed
and subsequently scaffolded with long reads. However, recent advancements in
the yield and accuracy of long-read sequencing have demonstrated that
a long-read-first hybrid assembly—where a long-read-only assembly is generated and
subsequently polished with short reads—can yield more accurate assemblies. This
manuscript adopts the long-read-first approach. Additionally, we provide an online
tutorial (github.com/rrwick/perfect-bacterial-genome-tutorial) with sample data from the hybrid sequencing of
Staphylococcus aureus strain JKD61596 to facilitate replication and further exploration
of this method.
