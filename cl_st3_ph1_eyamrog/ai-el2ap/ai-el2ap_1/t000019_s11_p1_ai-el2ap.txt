Technologies are often understood only in terms of their immediate
and widely recognized features, with public discourse typically emphasizing the
positive outcomes and benefits associated with technological products. This focus
tends to overlook the dialectical nature of technological development, resulting
in limited attention to the socio-historical relationships between humans and
the natural environment. Consequently, this lack of consideration for broader
contextual factors impedes more comprehensive and nuanced analyses of technology.
