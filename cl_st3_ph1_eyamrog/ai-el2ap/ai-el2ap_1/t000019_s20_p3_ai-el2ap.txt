In the BNCC, digital information and communication technologies (DICT) are
emphasized, with goal 5 recommending their integration as a foundational
objective across all levels of basic education and subsequently within
all specific subject areas (Brasil, 2017, p. 9). The transversal
inclusion of DICT in the document facilitates its incorporation throughout
various educational stages and disciplines, thereby establishing it as a
central component of the Brazilian school curriculum.
