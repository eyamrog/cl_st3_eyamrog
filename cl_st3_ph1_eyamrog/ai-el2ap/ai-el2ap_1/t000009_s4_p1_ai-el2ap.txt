This paper examines the benefits of utilizing information and communication
technology (ICT) to conduct a contextual Textual and Situational Analysis
(TSA) remotely. The results indicate that ICT use was essential
for two primary reasons: it facilitated data analysis through various
software programs, including Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and AntConc, and
it enabled the researcher to collect data remotely while maintaining
the specificity, practical application, and critical perspective advocated by Critical
English for Academic Purposes (CEAP) pedagogy.
