Once materials have been archived, significant periods of time may
elapse before they are accessed or utilized by other researchers.
For instance, linguist Catherine Callaghan (1931–2019) recorded Sarah Ballard speaking
Bodega Miwok (Miwokan; California) in 1960 while Callaghan was a
graduate student in linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley
(PhD, 1963). She donated these and additional recordings to the
California Language Archive in 1979 (Ballard and Callaghan, n.d.). Approximately
forty years later, in 2019, linguist Andrew Cowell (Berkeley PhD,
1993) produced time-aligned transcriptions of these recordings using ELAN, which
he also archived in the same repository (Cowell, 2019+). The
two collections are cross-referenced in the archive’s digital catalog, facilitating
their joint consultation. Similarly, linguist Gladwyn Kingsley Noble, Jr. (1923–1994)
recorded speakers of Wapishana and Atorai (Arawak; Brazil, Guyana) during
a field trip to Guyana in 1965. After passing through
the possession of various academics, the 13 tapes were donated
to the California Language Archive around 2006 by Manjari Ohala
(see George et al., 1965). The Atorai recordings, previously believed
to represent a language with no remaining first-language speakers, were
used by O’Hagan (2018) for a preliminary phonological description, which
was further developed by E. Miller (2021) in an undergraduate
honors thesis. In 2021, the texts from these recordings were
translated by remaining speakers now living in Wapishana communities, and
these materials may serve as the foundation for an Atorai
language workshop planned for 2022 (K. Rybka, p.c.).
