The B-PREA-R is a brief and user-friendly assessment tool designed
for use in educational settings, demonstrating adequate psychometric properties for
evaluating cognitive development in preschool children. It facilitates the identification
of individual strengths and weaknesses and supports the planning of
cognitive preparation for entry into primary education. The updated version
of the battery has enhanced validity and reliability, with 96%
of items rated as high or good quality and only
4% rated as fair quality. Additionally, improvements in the number
and quality of subtests enable a more comprehensive characterization of
the childâ€™s readiness for the next stage of schooling. The
features of the B-PREA-R permit its application by educators for
both interim and final evaluations, making it a suitable alternative
for assessing preschool children in accordance with Resolution 238/2014, which
governs the school evaluation system in Cuba.
