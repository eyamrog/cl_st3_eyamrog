The effect of dehydration on stems and leaves is known
to increase the stiffness and toughness of these organs in
self-supporting plant species (Boldrin et al. 2018, Caliaro et al.
2013, Niklas 1992). To minimize dehydration in fresh plant samples
such as stems, roots, and leaves, these materials are typically
transported to the laboratory for biomechanical testing immediately after collection
(Gallenmüller et al. 2004). However, experimental data quantifying the impact
of dehydration on biomechanical properties are limited, and such studies
have not been conducted on lianas. Lianas, or woody climbers,
are significant components of tropical forests, representing approximately 25% of
woody stem species diversity (Gentry 1991, Schnitzer & Bongers 2011),
and contribute substantially to forest dynamics as well as serving
as food sources and canopy pathways for animals (Schnitzer &
Bongers 2002; Putz & Mooney 1991). In disturbed habitats and
forest edges, lianas are particularly abundant, with stems that are
typically thin, flexible, and form dense tangles (Schnitzer & Bongers
2011). Lianas possess distinctive stem anatomies characterized by high flexibility
and a prevalence of parenchymatous tissue, which facilitates torsion and
enhances resistance to damage following injury (Rowe et al. 2004,
Read & Stokes 2006, Rocha et al. 2020). We hypothesized
that fresh liana stem and leaf samples maintained in a
moist condition would preserve their original bending stiffness and fracture
toughness, respectively, whereas gradual dehydration due to air exposure would
result in increased stiffness and toughness within a few hours.
To address this gap in knowledge, we selected a single
liana species as a model to test whether (i) the
structural Young’s modulus of stems and the fracture toughness of
leaves increase during progressive dehydration over time, and (ii) to
determine the duration for which stems and leaves maintain stable
biomechanical properties following field collection.
