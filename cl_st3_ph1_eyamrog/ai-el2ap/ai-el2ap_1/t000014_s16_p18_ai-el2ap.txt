Ethics and ethical best practices have been extensively addressed in
the language documentation literature, with particular emphasis on collaboration (Glenn,
2009; Leonard and Haynes, 2010), community involvement and engagement (Yamada,
2007; Czaykowska-Higgins, 2009; Sapién, 2018; Bischoff and Jany, 2018), and
the relevance of ethical frameworks across different global contexts (Dobrin,
2008; Holton, 2009; Pérez Báez, Rogers, and Rosés Labrada, 2016).
The relationship between archiving and ethics has also been the
subject of significant discussion, as exemplified by Macri and Sarmento
(2010) and Innes (2010), who examined ethical considerations pertaining to
language archives. Within these debates, the concept of informed consent
has been a central concern, with several scholars critically evaluating
the extent to which consent obtained from participants can be
considered genuinely informed (Grinevald, 2006; Robinson, 2010). A summary of
key issues related to informed consent is provided by Dwyer
(2006, pp. 43–48).
