Spatial executions refer to the placement and dimensions of drawings
and figures on surfaces such as paper or the blackboard,
including their orientation along right-left, up-down, and deep-shallow axes in
both motor and perceptual activities. This concept also encompasses the
organization of objects such as toys, clothes, or other items
within a defined spatial area.
