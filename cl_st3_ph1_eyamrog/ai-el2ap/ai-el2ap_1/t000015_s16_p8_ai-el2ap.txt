The significant linguistic diversity among JUOJS challenges the widely held
assumption that English is the sole language of science, as
suggested by a recent headline in Nature (Elnathan, 2021). English
only became the dominant language in research and scholarship during
the latter half of the twentieth century, having previously shared
prominence with French and German. Furthermore, while medieval Latin functioned
as the primary language of learning in Western contexts, the
transmission of knowledge from the Islamic world in Arabic, particularly
through the twelfth-century translation movement, played a crucial role in
shaping scholarly communication (Hunter-Konos, 2015; Willinsky, 2017, pp. 117-152).
