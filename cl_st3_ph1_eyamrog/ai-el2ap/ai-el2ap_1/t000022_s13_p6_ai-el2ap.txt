The evolution of the journals demonstrates two notable periods of
growth: the first between 1998 and 2000, and the second
in 2005, which correspond to the launch years of SciELO
and Redalyc, respectively. Journals published in Brazil contribute substantially to
this trend, as evidenced by a marked increase in the
number of journals in 1998. The overall trajectory remains upward,
with the number of journals rising to 198 in 2004
and 324 in 2005. Similar, though less pronounced, upward trends
are observed in the other six countries with significant publishing
activity, as illustrated in Figure 2. The initial major increase
in these countries occurs between 1999 and 2000, coinciding with
SciELOâ€™s expansion beyond Brazil. For instance, the number of journals
in Mexico increased from 23 in 1996 to 87 in
2000. The most significant relative increase is observed in Colombia,
where the number of journals rose from 4 to 35
during the same period.
