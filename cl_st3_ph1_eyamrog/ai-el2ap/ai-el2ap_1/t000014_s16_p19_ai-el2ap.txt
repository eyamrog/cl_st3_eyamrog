Informed consent is both a legal requirement in many jurisdictions,
including Brazil, and a moral obligation. It is therefore essential
that participants fully understand the nature of their involvement and,
in particular, the implications of digital archiving. A significant challenge
to obtaining informed consent for archiving arises from varying levels
of familiarity with archives, the Internet, and, in some cases,
computers among community members and participants. As Robinson (2010, p.
189) notes, it is questionable whether truly informed consent can
be obtained if participants or their communities have never encountered
a computer, an archive, or the Internet. Two additional issues
are relevant in this context. First, research is inherently open-ended;
while corpora are typically collected to address specific research questions,
the findings may generate new questions, potentially altering the scope
of the project. This raises the question of whether initial
consent remains valid if project goals evolve or new research
directions emerge, particularly given that archived data may be reused
by others in the future. Second, future generations and communities
may require access to these materials for language revitalization, as
discussed by Bomfim (2017). The following section illustrates these challenges
and outlines one possible approach to addressing some of these
concerns.
