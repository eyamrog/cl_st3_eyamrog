The groups of children were selected using a lottery procedure:
all groups were identified by institution, number of children, and
age, and their information was placed into three separate boxes
corresponding to the following age ranges—Group 1: 46–58 months, Group
2: 60–70 months, and Group 3: 72–82 months. Two groups
were then randomly selected by age to obtain a sample
comprising 100 or more children. The study was approved by
the Ministry of Education of the province as part of
the project "Stimulation of Neurodevelopment in Early Childhood" conducted by
the Faculty of Education at the University of Cienfuegos. Inclusion
criteria for participating children were: (1) age between 46 and
82 months, (2) typical development for their chronological age, and
(3) medium socioeconomic status, defined as families in which both
parents receive a salary between 2,100 and 4,000 Cuban pesos.
Parental consent and child assent were obtained as ethical requirements
for participation. The characteristics of the sample are presented in
Table 1.
