Currently, digital recordings are stored on a 32TB Network Attached
Storage (NAS) system. To mitigate data loss in the event
of a hard drive failure, RAID-6 redundancy is employed, resulting
in an effective storage capacity of 22TB. The data from
this NAS is duplicated onto a new 96TB NAS, which,
after accounting for redundancy, provides 72TB of usable storage (see
Figure 4). To protect against risks such as fire or
lightning, the two NAS units are housed in separate buildings.
Audio recordings are preserved in their original .wav format, while
video recordings are maintained in both their highest definition format
and in a compressed .mpg format to optimize storage efficiency.
These compressed video files and audio files are cataloged and
managed using Language Archiving Technology (LAT) software. The majority of
these files are also copied to the server maintained by
the Information and Communication Technology Sector of the Goeldi Museum.
