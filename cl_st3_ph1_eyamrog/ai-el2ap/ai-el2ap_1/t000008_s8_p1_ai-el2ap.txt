Palm seeds frequently exhibit morphophysiological dormancy, which is attributed to
underdeveloped embryos (Baskin & Baskin 2014) and the presence of
a thick endocarp that impedes both germination and embryo development
(Pérez 2009; Ribeiro et al. 2011; Oliveira et al. 2013;
Carvalho et al. 2015; Oliveira et al. 2015; Soares et
al. 2021). Water treatments have been shown to accelerate the
germination of palm seeds by enhancing oxygen uptake and reducing
mechanical constraints imposed by the seed tissues (Bovi 1990; Martin
et al. 1996; Ferreira & Gentil 2006; Fava & Albuquerque
2011; Rubio Neto et al. 2012; Pinto et al. 2012;
Goudel et al. 2013; Ferreira et al. 2021). In contrast,
hot-water treatments at approximately 75°C have been evaluated for their
effects on the germination of tropical palm seeds but generally
do not facilitate dormancy release (Martin et al. 1996; Rodrigues-Junior
et al. 2016).
