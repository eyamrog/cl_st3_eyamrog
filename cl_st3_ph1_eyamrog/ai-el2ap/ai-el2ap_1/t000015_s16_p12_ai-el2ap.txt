The disciplinary distribution of journals indicates that social science research
constitutes the largest proportion among journals, although the STEM fields—particularly
medical and health sciences, followed by engineering and technology—also represent
a significant share by journal count (Figure 8). The presence
of STEM journals is noteworthy, given the expectation that research
conducted outside central institutions reflects a higher degree of cultural
diversity and constitutes a substantial portion of overall research activity
(Figure 9). While social sciences and humanities are often considered
to have a primarily local relevance that can be effectively
addressed by researchers based in those locations, the perceived universality
of the sciences has traditionally facilitated their concentration in central
institutions. However, the current results suggest a more distributed pattern
of research activity within the sciences, technologies, engineering, and mathematics
(STEM) fields.
