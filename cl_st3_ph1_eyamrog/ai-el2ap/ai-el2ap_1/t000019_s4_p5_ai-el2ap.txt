The necessary conditions for effective integration of information and communication
technologies (ICT) in education are lacking in both public schools
and households belonging to socioeconomic classes D and E, which
constitute the primary users of these schools. Most Brazilian public
schools do not possess adequate human or technological resources to
support the development of ICT-based teaching, whether in-person or remote.
In practice, the primary measure implemented, including during the pandemic,
has been the distribution of educational materials via various messaging
applications, with students completing assignments and returning them through the
same platforms. This approach does not constitute distance education, as
the essential requirements for such a modality are not met.
Consequently, although the discourse surrounding the flexibility and benefits of
distance learning and the use of digital devices has been
promoted, there has been no implementation of online education characterized
by meaningful interaction and comprehensive training, as previously noted by
Costa and Lib√¢neo (2018), even prior to the pandemic.
