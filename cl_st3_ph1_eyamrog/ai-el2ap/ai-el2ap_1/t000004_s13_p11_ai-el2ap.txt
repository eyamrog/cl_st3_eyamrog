Each game of capoeira begins and ends in front of
the orchestra, specifically near the berimbau. Typically, the two capoeiristas
seated closest to the orchestra—at the ends of the semi-circle
formed by participants who are not playing in the orchestra—approach
each other and squat in front of the gunga, which
is one of the three berimbaus commonly used in the
orchestra and is played by the individual leading the roda.
They then wait for the signal to commence the game.
The game generally follows an attack-dodge dynamic, with attacks most
often taking the form of non-contact kicks. Head-butts are also
common and are regarded positively, whereas hand strikes are infrequently
employed. The distinction between attack and defense is not always
clear; for instance, while evading an attack, a player may
simultaneously execute a rasteira (sweep). This ambiguity is central to
the concept of malandragem, which involves deceiving the opponent by
feigning one movement and performing another. Through their choice of
techniques, players attempt to place each other at a disadvantage
or to expose vulnerable areas of the body. The attack-defense
dynamic may occasionally be interrupted by ritual performances such as
the chamada or volta ao mundo, or by brief, spontaneous
dance or dramatic displays, which are often humorous in nature.
