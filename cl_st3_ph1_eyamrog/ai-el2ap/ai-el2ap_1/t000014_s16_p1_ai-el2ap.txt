This section examines archiving initiatives in Brazil and their significance
for indigenous language documentation. Given the high number of indigenous
languages in Brazil and their endangered status (Moore, Galucio, and
Gabas, 2008), language documentation is both urgent and broadly supported
by indigenous communities. According to the National Inventory of Linguistic
Diversity’s survey of languages in the state of Rondônia, indigenous
respondents identified documentation as their second highest priority regarding their
languages, following the correction of orthographic errors and the production
of accurate written materials (Galucio, Moore, and Van der Voort,
2018, p. 217). Many indigenous groups have members, particularly young
people, who are proficient in computer use, which facilitates digital
documentation efforts. As a result, there is significant potential for
the production of a large volume of recordings. However, the
long-term preservation and accessibility of these materials require substantial digital
storage capacity.
