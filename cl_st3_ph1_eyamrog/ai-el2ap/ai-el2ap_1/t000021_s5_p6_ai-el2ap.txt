However, cognitive change is also associated with certain drawbacks. For
instance, while attributing external causality may alleviate negative emotions in
the short term, it can undermine long-term performance by reducing
teachers' sense of responsibility for students' development (Pereira, Marinotti, &
Luna, 2004). Additionally, teachers may engage in negative self-assessment by
attributing responsibility for adverse situations to themselves, which can result
in self-blame. This form of evaluation has the potential to
negatively impact teachers' well-being, as it may lead to perceptions
of inadequacy and incompetence, and contribute to feelings of frustration,
distress, and guilt (Clar√†, 2017). Consequently, cognitive change that emphasizes
negative aspects can intensify negative emotions, reinforce feelings of apathy
and helplessness, and diminish teachers' capacity to effectively address challenging
circumstances.
