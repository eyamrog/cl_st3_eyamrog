Despite the diversity in team-specific identification practices, the annual scheduling
of tournaments around dates of national significance in Timor-Leste emphasized
the shared national identity of the players. These tournaments brought
all clubs together in sporting events, which, in the Irish
context, positioned them as members of a single diasporic community
with origins in Timor-Leste. Notably, details of these tournaments were
regularly posted on Facebook and YouTube and were viewed by
individuals in Timor-Leste as well as across the diaspora. These
regular postings formed part of broader digital practices and intensive
use of mobile technology within the transnationally connected Timorese diaspora.
Additionally, the specific migration trajectories, communicative repertoires, and funds of
knowledge possessed by some Timorese individuals in Northern Ireland have
enabled them to assume leadership roles in organizing group activities
with distinctive characteristics, such as football clubs with particular ethos
or cultural groups oriented towards specific aspects of Timorese heritage.
For some individuals, there is significant opportunity to exercise agency
within local contexts, facilitating the creation of spaces for solidarity
and social interaction through organizational practices that involve complex and
context-specific uses of linguistic and semiotic resources. Concurrently, these processes
of adaptation in the new country are contributing to the
development of a strong sense of shared history and belonging
linked to the nation of origin.
