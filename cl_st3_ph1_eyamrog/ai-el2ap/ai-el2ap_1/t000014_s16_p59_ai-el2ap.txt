The archives discussed in this study utilize a system of
graded access codes to designate varying levels of accessibility for
different files. In the ELAR archive, the codes are as
follows: (a) O, indicating open access; (b) U, indicating materials
accessible upon creation of a user account; and (c) S,
indicating materials that are restricted and require explicit permission from
the depositor for access. Files classified under the S code
may contain personal or sensitive information about speakers, such as
recorded conversations or life histories, or may be subject to
ongoing analysis by the depositor. The AILLA collection employs a
comparable system, using numerical codes to represent similar access levels.
Additionally, some archives mandate that users complete a free registration
process on the website prior to accessing any materials.
