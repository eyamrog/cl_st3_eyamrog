The scarcity of trees with accessible branches at approximately 2
m in height, which would facilitate manual attachment of epiphytic
bromeliads without specialized equipment, should be taken into account when
evaluating the feasibility of relocating these species directly to the
ground. This is particularly relevant because larger branches suitable for
attachment are typically found in the crowns of large trees.
If epiphytic bromeliads are capable of surviving on the soil
for extended periods, direct ground relocation may offer a more
practical alternative, potentially supporting continued growth, sprouting, and inflorescence production
(Ara√∫jo 2006). With respect to pollination, Varassin and Sazima (2000)
documented that the hummingbirds Phaethornis eurynome and Ramphodon naevius pollinate
bromeliads in the lower forest strata, suggesting that translocation to
the ground, as opposed to higher tree elevations, may not
negatively impact pollination of the transplanted species. For instance, Nidularium
rubens, a terrestrial species, is visited by P. eurynome (Machado
& Semir 2006).
