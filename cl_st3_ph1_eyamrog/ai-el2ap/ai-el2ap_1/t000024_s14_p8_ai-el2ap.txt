All 60 specimens of W. cyathiformis were successfully relocated, with
100% of individuals observed in the vegetative stage and no
evidence of floral scape development. For Aechmea distichantha, leaf and
sprout data were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model
(GLMM), and means were compared using the Bonferroni test. For
Wittrockia cyathiformis, the number of leaves and sprouts was assessed
for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test; as the assumptions of
normality were not met, the data were analyzed using the
Friedman test, with medians compared by the Pairwise Comparisons test
(Durbin-Conover). All statistical analyses were conducted using JAMOVI software (The
Jamovi Project 2022). Survival analysis for both bromeliad species was
performed using the SISVAR program (Ferreira 2011), employing a split-plot
in time experimental design distributed across three blocks, with the
main treatment factor being the method of relocation.
