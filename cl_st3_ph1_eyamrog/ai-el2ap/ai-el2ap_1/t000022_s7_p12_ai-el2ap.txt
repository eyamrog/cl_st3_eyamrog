Based on these considerations, a manual and systematic revision of
the journals was conducted. Initially, journals indexed exclusively in either
SciELO or Redalyc were identified, and their metadata—including articles, reviews,
and editorials—were aggregated, encompassing both currently active journals and documents
from earlier periods that filled gaps in coverage. For journals
indexed in both platforms, discrepancies in coverage periods were observed,
with each platform sometimes indexing different time spans for the
same journal. To address this, the consistency and completeness of
the data were assessed, and for each case, the version
with the most extensive temporal coverage and the highest number
of documents was retained. It is important to note that
this phase of the project focused exclusively on journals published
in Latin America and the Caribbean.
