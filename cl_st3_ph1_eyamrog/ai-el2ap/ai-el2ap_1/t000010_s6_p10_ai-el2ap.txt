The present research posits that neuropsychological and intellectual development in
preschool children is influenced by sociocultural factors. These factors should
be examined through distinct categories to enhance the understanding of
their impact, including family structure and functioning, parental characteristics such
as educational attainment, parenting style, and the frequency, intensity, and
type of stimulation activities provided, as well as aspects of
educational institutions, such as curricular programs, educator qualifications, frequency of
stimulation, and the nature of activities conducted. Future research should
investigate these variables from the perspective of the sociology of
culture and assess their relationship with the development of neuropsychological
functions.
