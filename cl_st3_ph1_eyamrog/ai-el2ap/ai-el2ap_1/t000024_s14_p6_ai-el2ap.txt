Two independent experiments were conducted using the bromeliad species Aechmea
distichantha and Wittrockia cyathiformis. The experimental design employed a split-plot
arrangement over time, distributed across three blocks, with the primary
treatment being the mode of relocation (epiphytic or terricolous). For
Aechmea distichantha, additional independent variables were assessed, specifically the phenological
stage (vegetative or reproductive).
