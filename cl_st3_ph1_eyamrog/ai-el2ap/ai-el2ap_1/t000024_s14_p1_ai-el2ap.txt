Study area – The plants were collected from Section 4
in Arujá, São Paulo State, and from São Paulo, São
Paulo State, where vegetation clearance was conducted for the construction
of the Rodoanel Mário Covas Trecho Norte, as previously described
by Guardia et al. (2021). The layout of the collection
area is shown in Figure 1a. The relocation site was
situated 4 km from the original collection area (Figure 1b)
(Google Earth 2022). The selected relocation site is located within
the Montane Dense Ombrophilous Forest of Parque Estadual da Cantareira
(PEC), São Paulo State, Brazil. This park covers 7,916.52 ha
and is recognized as one of the largest urban forests
globally, as well as a major forest remnant in the
metropolitan region of São Paulo. The area contains numerous springs
and is designated by UNESCO as the Central Zone of
the São Paulo City Green Belt Biosphere Reserve (São Paulo
2009). Most of the forest is in an intermediate stage
of regeneration, with some areas in advanced and mature stages
(São Paulo 2009). The climate is classified as mesothermal and
humid, with minor rainfall deficits and a surplus of precipitation
during the summer (Cfb classification, Köppen 1948; Alvares et al.
2013). The mean annual rainfall is 1,322 mm, with the
highest monthly precipitation in January (229.8 mm) and the lowest
in August (31.7 mm) (São Paulo 2009). The relocation area
within the forest, specifically along the Macuco Trail (23º24’29” S,
46º34’57” W), exhibited 75% canopy shading as measured by a
Minipa® digital lux meter. Recorded temperatures in this area ranged
from 16.5 ºC (June and July) to 26 ºC (January
and February), occasionally exceeding 32 ºC during the relocation activities
(Figure 2). This temperature range was consistent with conditions during
the plant collection period (2013–2014), which ranged from 15 ºC
to 26 ºC, with peaks above 32 ºC in the
hottest months (INMET 2022). The mean annual rainfall in 2013–2014
was also 1,322 mm.
