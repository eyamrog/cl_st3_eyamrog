Feenberg (2003) argues that in modern society, technology is increasingly
perceived as independent of prior values and is primarily regarded
as a means to achieve human objectives. According to Feenberg,
this represents an instrumental conception of technology, which reduces technology
to the status of a tool subject to human control.
From this perspective, the destructive use of bombs, for instance,
is not inherent to the technology itself but is instead
determined by human choice.
