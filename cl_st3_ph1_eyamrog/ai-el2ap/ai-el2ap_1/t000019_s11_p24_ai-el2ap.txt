According to IBGE surveys (2018), 33% of the Brazilian population
experiences some form of digital exclusion. While this represents an
improvement compared to 2009, when only 39% of the population
had Internet access, a detailed analysis of current data reveals
persistent disparities. Specifically, 50% of individuals in socioeconomic classes D
and E lack Internet access, whereas over 90% of those
in classes A and B are connected (CGI.br, 2019a). These
data indicate that the digital divide in Brazil is primarily
associated with socioeconomic factors rather than generational differences in exposure
to information and communication technologies (ICT). Although individuals classified as
digital natives may have certain advantages, digital exclusion is more
strongly linked to unequal access to digital devices and educational
opportunities related to their use (Conceição, 2019; Krug et al.,
2018).
