The cell is 1.1 to 1.3 times broader than long,
with a deep median constriction; the sinus is closed near
the isthmus and gradually opens toward the extremity. Semicells are
hexagonal with a truncate apex and acute apical angles. The
cell wall is smooth, containing a single chloroplast and one
pyrenoid per semicell. Papillae are present in the mid-region of
the semicells. In apical view, the cell appears diamond-shaped; the
lateral view was not observed. Cell dimensions are as follows:
length 8–9.2 µm, width 10–11 µm, and isthmus 3.2–3.5 µm.
