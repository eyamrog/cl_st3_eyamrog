The photograph on the left depicts the cup with ribbons
draped around it and attached to the medals. The ribbons
are in three colors—red, yellow, and black—which correspond to the
colors of the national flag of Timor-Leste. The photograph on
the right displays the date of the tournament engraved on
the base of the cup, presented in both Portuguese and
English.
