Different research paradigms can involve markedly different assumptions, particularly when
considering the two broadest perspectives. The first paradigm is characterized
as positivist, nomothetic, and confirmatory, indicating a focus on definitive
and objective knowledge, the identification of general patterns or laws,
and the testing of hypotheses. This paradigm is based on
the assumption that it is possible to report unambiguous truth
through observable phenomena and verified facts (Taber, 2013, p. 49).
According to Guba and Lincoln (1994), this approach is grounded
in a realist ontology and an objectivist epistemology. Realist ontology
posits that an apprehendable reality exists, governed by immutable natural
laws and mechanisms (p. 109), while objectivist epistemology assumes that
the investigator and the object of investigation are independent entities,
allowing the investigator to study the object without mutual influence
(p. 110). Consequently, this approach to social science is considered
objectivist and determinist, as it conceptualizes human beings as products
of their environment and as responding to external stimuli (Cohen
et al., 2007).
