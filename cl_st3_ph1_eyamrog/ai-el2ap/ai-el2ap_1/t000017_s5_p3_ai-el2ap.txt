The internal structure validity is maintained in both the previous
and revised versions of the B-PREA. Factor analysis of the
previous version identified three factors: Numerical Cognitive Processing Skills, Executive
Skills, and Linguistic Skills. The revised version also confirmed a
three-factor structure, comprising Executive Skills, Memory Skills, and Linguistic Skills.
In the revised version, Factor 1, labeled "Executive Skills," includes
five subtests: visual selective attention, matrices, story comprehension, graphomotor skills,
and counting quantities. These subtests encompass a range of skills
and actions relevant to the developmental stage and are consistent
with established theoretical models of executive functions (Doebel, 2020; Zelazo,
2020).
