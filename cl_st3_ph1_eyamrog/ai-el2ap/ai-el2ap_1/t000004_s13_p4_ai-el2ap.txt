Not all enslaved individuals accepted their conditions passively. Instances of
resistance occurred as early as the transatlantic voyage, with documented
cases of Africans seizing control of slave ships and attempting
to return to the African coast. In Brazil, acts of
escape, revolt, and resistance persisted throughout the entire period of
slavery. Fugitive slaves established quilombos, which were settlements that varied
in size, longevity, and proximity to other communities, and in
which they developed political, social, and cultural structures influenced by
African traditions (Gomes, 2015). The most prominent of these was
the Quilombo of Palmares, which is estimated to have housed
between 6,000 and 30,000 individuals (Marquese, 2006) and successfully resisted
external attempts at subjugation for an extended period. On agricultural
properties, enslaved people were typically awakened by the sound of
a bell and escorted by landowners to the fields, where
they worked until dusk. They were subjected to corporal punishment
for minor infractions, including whipping, branding, mutilation, sexual violence, and
other forms of torture, some of which were highly systematic
and severe (Aidoo, 2018).
