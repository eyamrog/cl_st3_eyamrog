In this study, we used cleaning interactions between birds and
mammals as a model system to investigate the influence of
opportunism and specialized lifestyles on the structure of ecological networks.
Cleaning interactions, defined as ecological relationships involving a client and
a cleaner, are observed in both marine and terrestrial ecosystems.
In terrestrial environments, several bird species engage in cleaning interactions
with mammalian herbivores. This behavior is exhibited by a diverse
array of bird species worldwide (e.g., Ruggiero and Ewes 1988;
Sazima 2007a). The avian cleaners benefit by feeding on parasites,
injured tissue, or blood from their mammalian hosts (Ivan Sazima
2011). While these interactions generally provide a benefit to the
cleaner, the effects on the client can be negative, neutral,
or positive. For most bird species, cleaning behavior is facultative;
however, certain species, such as some caracaras (Falconidae) and tyrant
flycatchers (Tyrannidae), display stereotyped behaviors associated with cleaning. In contrast,
oxpeckers (Buphagus spp.) in African savannahs are highly specialized cleaners
that derive the majority of their food resources from these
interactions. Therefore, cleaning interactions exhibit considerable variation in the degree
of opportunism and specialization, and we utilized this variation to
examine the relative importance of opportunism in shaping these ecological
relationships.
