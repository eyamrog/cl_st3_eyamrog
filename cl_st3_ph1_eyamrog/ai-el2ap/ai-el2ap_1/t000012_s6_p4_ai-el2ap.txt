In this study, we analyzed the structure of interactions and
the natural history of bird species involved in facultative interactions
to better understand the complexity of bird-mammal cleaning communities. While
both the history of resources consumed and degree centrality are
important for understanding interaction patterns, each factor contributes differently to
community composition. Our results indicate that the factors enabling species
to participate in ecological community networks are distinct from those
that influence their specific roles within these networks. Additionally, factors
such as species abundance can affect degree centrality. Therefore, the
role of a species is not determined by overall structural
generalism, but rather by its natural history and its integration
into various types of interactions.
