Saccoloma is a pantropical genus comprising approximately 24 species (Rojas-Alvarado
2010; Luong et al. 2015; Schwartsburd 2020, 2022). Although the
recognition of the genus Orthiopteris for Paleotropical species is supported
by phylogenetic evidence, it is not corroborated by morphological data;
therefore, it is more practical to include only Saccoloma within
Saccolomataceae (Schwartsburd 2022). In Brazil, nine species are currently recognized
(Schwartsburd 2022).
