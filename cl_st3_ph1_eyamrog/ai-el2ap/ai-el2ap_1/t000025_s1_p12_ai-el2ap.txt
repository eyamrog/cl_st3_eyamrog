This scoping review identified 20 potential topical therapies for pain
associated with malignant fungating wounds, as reported primarily in non-systematic
reviews, case reports, and a limited number of interventional studies.
Of these, eleven studies recommended the application of topical therapies
to the peri-wound skin, which function by establishing a protective
barrier.
