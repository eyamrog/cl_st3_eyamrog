Participants reported a range of emotions in response to the
identified emotional demands (Table 1). While some participants mentioned positive
emotions, the primary focus of this study was on negative
emotional responses. The most frequently reported and significant negative emotions
were anger, frustration, helplessness, and sadness. Interactional demands, including inappropriate
behavior, perceived lack of support, and excessive bureaucracy, were most
commonly associated with anger, frustration, and fear. In contrast, technical-pedagogical
demands, such as student demotivation, learning disabilities, classroom management challenges,
diversity, and academic indiscipline, were more often linked to frustration,
worry, compassion, impotence, and anguish, with demotivation and learning disabilities
being particularly salient. Overall, interactional demands appear to elicit the
most intense and challenging negative emotions to regulate.
