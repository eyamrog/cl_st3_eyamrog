The tempo and style of the game are determined by
the leader of the roda. If a participant does not
conform to the expected style of play, as illustrated in
Sophieâ€™s case above, the leader may prompt them to adjust
their speed by selecting an appropriate song. Additionally, the leader
can influence the dynamics of the game by choosing a
song with a faster rhythm and lyrics that encourage a
more aggressive style of play.
