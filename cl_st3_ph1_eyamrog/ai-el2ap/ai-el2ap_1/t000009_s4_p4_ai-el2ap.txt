This investigation, conducted using ICT tools and instruments, provided the
teacher-researcher with data to more effectively select and organize course
content based on its relevance to manuscript analysis by referees.
The findings informed and substantiated the teacher-researcher’s practice by supplying
pertinent information that was subsequently used to plan, organize, and
implement teaching activities (Vieira, 2019a). As demonstrated in this study,
the use of ICT enables a broader contextual analysis of
the TSA, facilitating engagement not only with local but also
with global academic communities, which is essential for students’ academic
development.
