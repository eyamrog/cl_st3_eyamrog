The family is cosmopolitan and comprises approximately eleven genera and
around 270 species (PPG I 2016; Shang et al. 2018;
Schwartsburd et al. 2020). The clade that includes Dennstaedtia, Leptolepia,
Microlepia, and Oenotrichia requires further taxonomic revision, as Dennstaedtia has
been shown to be polyphyletic (Schwartsburd et al. 2020).
