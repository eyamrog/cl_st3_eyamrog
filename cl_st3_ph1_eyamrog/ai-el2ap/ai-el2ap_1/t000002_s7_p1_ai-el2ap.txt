Extensive research has examined the role of language and discursive
interaction in the knowledge-building process within classroom-based settings (Howe &
Mercer, 2007; Mercer et al., 2020; Resnick et al., 2015;
Schwarz & Baker, 2016). Over the past four decades, this
area of study has developed under terms such as ‘classroom
dialogue’ and ‘dialogic teaching’ (Kim & Wilkinson, 2019; Mercer &
Dawes, 2014), encompassing investigations that seek to optimize the use
of discursive interactions in educational contexts (Alexander, 2008). This approach
in education has been referred to as the ‘dialogic turn’,
which highlights the importance of students’ voice, agency, and participation
in the collaborative construction of knowledge (Wilkinson & Son, 2011).
