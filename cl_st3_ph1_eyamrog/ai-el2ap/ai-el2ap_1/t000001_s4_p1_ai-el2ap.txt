In contrast to previous short-read-first hybrid assembly approaches such as
Unicycler, the method recommended here employs a long-read-first strategy. Long
reads provide a robust foundation for assembly due to their
superior ability to resolve repetitive regions, while short reads are
utilized exclusively for final polishing steps. This approach has the
potential to produce highly accurate genome assemblies with minimal errors.
However, establishing a definitive ground truth genome sequence remains challenging.
Therefore, when assembly accuracy is of particular importance, it is
advisable to generate multiple alternative assemblies that differ in data
sources and methodological parameters, including sequencing platforms, assemblers within the
Trycycler pipeline, read quality control thresholds, and short-read polishing tools.
Concordance among assemblies generated from different data or methods increases
confidence in their accuracy, whereas discrepancies between assemblies should prompt
further investigation, such as visual inspection of read alignments using
tools like IGV.
