Figure 2 presents the distributions of codes for group talk
contexts and discursive functions across tasks. The analysis identified only
a limited number of significant differences between groups. Specifically, a
significant difference in content was observed across contexts (H(6) =
17.575, p = .007), with post hoc comparisons indicating differences
between Tasks 3 and 4 (p = .037) and Tasks
3 and 5 (p = .022). Additionally, a significant difference
in off-topic talk was found (H(6) = 14.007, p =
.029), particularly between Tasks 3 and 5 (p = .046).
No significant differences were detected for instructional talk. Overall, students
engaged in more content-related discussion and less off-topic talk during
Tasks 2 and 3.
