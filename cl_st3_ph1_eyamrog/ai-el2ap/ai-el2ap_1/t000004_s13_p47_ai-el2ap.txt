Sandro explains the concept of fundamento, a central aspect of
capoeira, which refers to the way capoeira imparts ethical values
and guides individuals in living according to these principles (PORTAL
CAPOEIRA, 2022b). In his sessions, this phase typically involves translanguaging
between English and Portuguese, consistently integrated with musical activities. Students
are taught to sing both the melody and the lyrics
in Portuguese. Sandro generally recites a line of the song
in Portuguese multiple times, with students repeating after him. He
also provides translations and clarifies the meaning of the lyrics.
These translations are sometimes beneficial even for advanced speakers of
Portuguese, as some songs include archaic terms, slang, or dialectal
expressions.
