An analysis of the publishing institutions represented in the OLIVA
corpus reveals structural differences compared to mainstream commercial journals, particularly
regarding levels of autonomy and integration with the academic community.
Neubert and Rodrigues (2021) examined Latin American publications indexed in
the Web of Science and found that these articles appeared
in 11,965 scientific journals, with commercial publishers responsible for 56.48%
of the output, universities for 18.30%, and associations for 19.25%.
In contrast, journals indexed in SciELO and Redalyc are predominantly
published by universities, scientific societies, and government agencies, reflecting a
primarily academic orientation and providing editorial services within the public
domain. In Latin America, the establishment and maintenance of journals
have historically been managed by the scholarly community, which continues
to provide material support despite evaluation systems that incentivize publication
in mainstream commercial journals.
