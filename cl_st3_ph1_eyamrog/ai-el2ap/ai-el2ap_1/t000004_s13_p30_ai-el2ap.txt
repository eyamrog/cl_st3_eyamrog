One of the fundamental movements in capoeira is the three-step
ginga, which is performed in time with the music while
tracking the movements of the other participant. The continuous motion
of the ginga serves a strategic purpose by introducing unpredictability
and potentially confusing the opponent, thereby providing an effective foundation
for initiating attacks. Although participants often move in a coordinated
manner, strict mechanical imitation is discouraged in capoeira because it
increases predictability. Skilled practitioners intentionally disrupt the ginga pattern at
intervals; however, these variations are still executed rhythmically and remain
aligned with the musical accompaniment.
