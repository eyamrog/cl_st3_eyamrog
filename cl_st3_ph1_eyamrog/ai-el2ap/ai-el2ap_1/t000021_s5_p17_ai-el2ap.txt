Although less frequently discussed, the situation selection family of strategies
was identified in all focus groups. This approach involves avoiding
circumstances and events—such as specific people, activities, or methodologies—that elicit
negative emotions, while seeking out those that promote positive emotional
responses. Teachers commonly employ situation selection when preparing lesson plans,
activities, and teaching materials, as well as when selecting alternative
resources such as videos, games, and music. These decisions are
made with consideration for students’ developmental stages, challenges, preferences, and
interests, with the aim of being responsive and effective while
minimizing the emotional demands associated with potentially unpleasant events (Taxer
& Gross, 2018; Pereira, Marinotti, & Luna, 2004). Although situation
selection appears to offer benefits for both teachers and students,
it is reportedly used less frequently, possibly because it is
a proactive strategy that requires a broad repertoire of options
and the ability to anticipate both one’s own and others’
emotional reactions (Gross, 2015). Therefore, teachers’ planning, technical and relational
skills, and emotional awareness may facilitate the implementation of these
strategies.
