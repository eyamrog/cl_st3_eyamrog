Cosmarium abbreviatum var. minus was the only species recorded across
all types of environments studied, being present in lakes, lagoons,
and rivers. Most species were found in lentic environments, with
only seven species occurring in lotic systems; among these, Cosmarium
impressulum was the only species that demonstrated a preference for
lotic habitats. Cosmarium granatum var. granatum was the most frequently
observed species, followed by C. abbreviatum var. minus. Limão Lake
and Monsarás Lagoon exhibited the highest species diversity among the
environments studied, with 14 and 12 out of the 22
identified species, respectively. Regarding pH preference, contrary to the prevailing
view that the genus Cosmarium predominantly inhabits clean and acidic
waters (Bicudo & Menezes 2017), only four taxa were found
in acidic conditions, while most species were associated with circumneutral
and alkaline environments. Most species displayed a broad distribution with
respect to trophic state, with 10 species occurring in environments
up to mesotrophic conditions and 12 species present in eutrophic
or more nutrient-rich conditions. Total iron concentrations in the studied
systems ranged from 0.1 to 7.1 mg L⁻¹, with detailed
values for each sampling station provided in Zorzal-Almeida et al.
(2021). The majority of species were found in conditions with
total iron concentrations below 4.5 mg L⁻¹, and nearly half
occurred at concentrations below 1.5 mg L⁻¹. Two species, Cosmarium
norimbergense var. depressum (5.7 mg L⁻¹) and Cosmarium granatum var.
granatum (7.1 mg L⁻¹), were observed under comparatively high total
iron levels. This study provides new ecological and taxonomic data
for the genus Cosmarium Corda, particularly in tropical freshwater environments,
and highlights the need for further floristic research in Brazil,
especially in under-studied regions such as Espírito Santo State.
