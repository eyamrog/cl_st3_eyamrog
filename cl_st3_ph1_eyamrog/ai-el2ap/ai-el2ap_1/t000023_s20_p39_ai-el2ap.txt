According to Biolo et al. (2013), Cosmarium moniliforme closely resembles
Cosmarium contractum Kirchner but can be distinguished by its relatively
more subcircular semicells and an elliptical apical view. Although the
apical view of the specimens examined in this study was
not observed, the presence of subcircular semicells supported their identification
as C. moniliforme.
