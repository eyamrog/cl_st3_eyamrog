Publication in English is associated with a higher average number
of authors per article compared to other languages. Specifically, English-language
articles have an average of 4.3 authors, while Portuguese-language articles
have an average of 3.3 authors, and Spanish-language articles have
an average of 2.7 authors. The relatively high average for
Brazil is also related to the tendency of Brazilian authors
and journals to publish articles with two or more authors.
This pattern, with English having the highest average number of
authors followed by Portuguese and then Spanish, is consistent across
all subject areas.
