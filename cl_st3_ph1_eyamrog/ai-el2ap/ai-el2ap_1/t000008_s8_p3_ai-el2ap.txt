Knowledge of seed biology, including aspects such as dormancy, germination,
and storage, is essential for improving seed conservation techniques (Ellis
et al. 2007; Hay & Probert 2013; Costa et al.
2017) and for supporting restoration programs (Merritt & Dixon 2011;
Le√≥n-Lobos et al. 2012; Kildisheva et al. 2016; Vittis et
al. 2020). In order to ensure the effective conservation of
seeds from a given species, it is necessary to assess
their germination requirements and determine their seed storage behavior category,
which facilitates the identification of optimal storage conditions and the
potential duration of successful storage (Hong & Ellis 1996; Teixido
et al. 2017). However, information regarding seed dormancy, longevity, and
storage behavior remains limited for many wild native species in
Brazil (Ribeiro et al. 2016), and existing research has focused
on a relatively small number of palm species (Jagannathan 2021).
