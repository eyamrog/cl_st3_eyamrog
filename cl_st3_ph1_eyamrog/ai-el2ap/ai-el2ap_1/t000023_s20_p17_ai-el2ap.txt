The cell is 1.2 to 1.3 times longer than broad,
with a deep median constriction and a widely open sinus;
semicells are elliptical with a truncate to slightly rounded apex
and rounded angles. The cell wall is punctate, containing a
single chloroplast and one pyrenoid per semicell. Cell dimensions are
as follows: length 12–16.9 µm, width 9.4–14 µm, and isthmus
2.8–3.9 µm.
