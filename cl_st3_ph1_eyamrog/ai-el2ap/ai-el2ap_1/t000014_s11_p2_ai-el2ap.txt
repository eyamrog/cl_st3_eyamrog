In his influential article that established the foundations of language
documentation, Himmelmann (1998) identifies archiving as one of four essential
steps in the creation of what he terms “a language
documentation” (p. 171), defined as a collection of transcribed and
annotated audiovisual recordings accompanied by relevant metadata. Metadata comprise the
contextual, technical, and administrative information that supports the interpretation of
the data, including any keys such as codes or orthographies
necessary for understanding, analysis, and reuse (Kung et al., 2020).
Woodbury (2003) refers to such a collection of primary data
and its associated metadata as a “corpus,” and includes archiving
among six criteria that determine the overall quality of a
documentary corpus.
