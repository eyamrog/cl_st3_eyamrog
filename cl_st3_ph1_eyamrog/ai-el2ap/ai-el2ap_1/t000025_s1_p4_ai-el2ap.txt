Methods: Comprehensive searches were conducted in CINAHL, LILACS, Embase, Web
of Science, PubMed, Cochrane, NICE, Scopus, JBISRIR, and gray literature
sources, in English, Portuguese, and Spanish, without restrictions on publication
date. Two authors independently screened all citations, with a third
author resolving any discrepancies. Studies were included if they involved
adults with malignant fungal wounds and reported on topical pain
interventions. A data extraction tool was developed to facilitate synthesis
and thematic analysis. The study adhered to the PRISMA-ScR Checklist.
