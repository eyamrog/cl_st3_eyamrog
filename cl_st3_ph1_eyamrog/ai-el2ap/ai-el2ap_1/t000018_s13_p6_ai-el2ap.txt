Another important aspect of Luria's contributions is the emphasis on
information feedback, whereby multiple criteria from different sources are used
to confirm either a weakness or a strength in the
subject. For example, within the educational setting, the educator observes
whether the child is focused on the activity, holds the
pencil correctly, follows instructions, and demonstrates enjoyment during the task.
In addition, the educator is responsible for consulting with the
parents regarding the child's behavior at home, such as whether
the child picks up toys when asked, eats slowly and
uses utensils appropriately, bathes or dresses independently, and plays cooperatively
with peers while respecting rules and demonstrating respect, affection, and
companionship. The triangulation of information between the educator and the
family serves as a valuable tool in the educational process,
as it enables the educator to identify and verify the
needs of both the child and the family, thereby informing
and guiding educational interventions in alignment with established objectives.
