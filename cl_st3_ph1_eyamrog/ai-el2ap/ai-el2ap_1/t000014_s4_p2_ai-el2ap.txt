As demonstrated in this article, archiving constitutes a fundamental aspect
of language documentation. Reliable long-term preservation and accessibility of documentary
materials are achievable only through archiving, particularly when supported by
well-maintained digital repositories with sufficient infrastructure and institutional commitment. In
recent decades, there has been a notable increase in the
number and robustness of documentation projects and archival collections, as
illustrated by the Paresi and Enawene Nawe projects discussed in
the final section of this article (see also Moore and
Galucio, 2016). However, continued participation and investment in archiving are
necessary to sustain the outcomes of such documentary efforts. This
involves contributing to, supporting, and expanding archiving initiatives at multiple
levels, including regional and national projects such as the Museu
Goeldi in Brazil, as well as internationally oriented archives like
AILLA. Additionally, it is important to enhance opportunities for speaker
and heritage communities to access these materials, both independently and
in collaboration with archives. Linguists have both a social and
academic responsibility to archive the materials they produce, to support
the archiving of legacy materials, to maximize accessibility, and to
collaborate with communities to ensure ethical practices throughout the process.
