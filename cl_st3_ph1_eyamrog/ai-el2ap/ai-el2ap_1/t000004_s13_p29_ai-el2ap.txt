The concept of utilizing dance as a form of disguise
persists in contemporary capoeira. For example, Sandro often questioned the
characterization of capoeira as a dance by stating, "if capoeira
is a dance, then dance with me." The primary distinction
between capoeira and dance lies in the combative aspect; capoeiristas
maintain a heightened state of alertness, fully aware that an
attack may occur at any moment.
