Gestures and praxis (t = 6.229, p = 0.000), phonemic
hearing (t = 7.974, p = 0.000), picture vocabulary (t
= 8.187, p = 0.000), and color naming (t =
3.228, p = 0.003) were significant predictors of the variability
in intellectual performance among children from Cienfuegos province, with the
predictive strength of these variables ranging from 0.217 to 0.660
(Table 3). In contrast, the same neuropsychological tests did not
significantly predict the variability in intellectual performance among children from
Sancti Sp√≠ritus.
