To determine the relative water content (RWC; %), five stem
and leaf samples with dimensions identical to those used in
biomechanical tests were analyzed. The RWC at each dehydration level
i was calculated using the formula: [(wi - wd) /
(wt - wd)] × 100, where wi represents the mass
(g) of the sample at dehydration level i (i.e., at
each time interval), wt is the mass at full hydration,
and wd is the dry mass, following the method described
by Scoffoni et al. (2014). Full hydration was achieved by
floating samples in distilled water on trays lined with damp
paper for 24 hours, with mass measurements repeated at least
three times until stabilization. After the imbibition period, samples were
oven-dried at 60 °C for 24 hours and weighed at
least three times until mass stabilization to determine dry mass,
as described by Turner (1981). For anatomical analysis, stem and
leaf samples were sectioned transversely using a sliding microtome after
gradual embedding in polyethylene glycol (PEG 1500) according to Rupp
(1964). To minimize tissue damage during sectioning, expanded polystyrene dissolved
in butyl acetate was applied to the samples, and adhesive
tape was affixed prior to cutting, following Barbosa et al.
(2010). The sections were double-stained with 1% (w/v) Astra blue
and 1% (w/v) safranin to differentiate cells containing cellulose from
those containing both cellulose and lignin, as described by Bukatsch
(1972) and Kraus and Arduin (1997), and permanent slides were
prepared using Canada balsam.
