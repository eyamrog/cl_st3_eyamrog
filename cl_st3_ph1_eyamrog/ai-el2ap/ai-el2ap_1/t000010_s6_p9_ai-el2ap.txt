Frontal lobe development supports the advancement of both motor and
fluid intelligence, as these cognitive domains benefit from the maturation
of associated brain structures (Khng & Ng, 2021). The available
evidence indicates that intelligence can be enhanced not only through
reasoning-based tasks but also through activities and games that engage
perception and motor skills, which in turn facilitate reasoning and
analysis. Similarly, the findings of Fernández-Hernández et al. (2022) demonstrate
that children's physical conditions contribute to the development and performance
of higher cognitive functions. Although this study exercised limited control
over educational and cultural variables, the results indicate significant neuropsychological
and intellectual variability among groups of children residing within the
same country. These findings highlight the importance of considering three
factors when administering cognitive and neuropsychological assessments to children: first,
ensuring the standardization and validity of tests in accordance with
regional characteristics; second, establishing appropriate norms for classification and diagnosis;
and third, evaluating the sociocultural context of the child, including
family environment, parental stimulation, and the role of educational institutions.
