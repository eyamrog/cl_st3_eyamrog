Plant harvesting: Following deforestation, 60 adult individuals of each species,
previously located either on tree branches or on the soil,
were randomly collected by fieldworkers, with efforts made to minimize
mechanical damage to the root systems. The collected specimens were
pooled and randomly transplanted into pots, without regard to their
original substrate (trunk or ground). Plant collection was carried out
by the research group from the Instituto de Botânica of
São Paulo State, Brazil. Subsequently, the plants were cultivated in
a substrate composed of composted Pinus bark and maintained in
a nursery covered with high-density polyethylene black shade cloth providing
50% shading for a period of six to twelve months
prior to relocation (see Figures 3a–b).
