The results indicate that the simultaneous relocation of A. distichantha
and W. cyathiformis as both epiphytic and terrestrial individuals is
feasible. However, relocating these bromeliads to soil substrates can reduce
implantation costs during rescue operations by significantly decreasing the labor
required for their establishment.
