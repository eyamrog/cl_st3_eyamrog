The visibility and circulation of the JUOJS were evaluated by
identifying their presence in 11 research indexes, directories, and lists.
Analysis of the Web of Science Citation Reports and Cabells
Predatory Reports was conducted using Stanford University Library licensing agreements,
with Cabells verifying the inclusion of JUOJS in its database
based on the provided dataset. EBSCOHost, Scopus, OpenAlex, DOAJ, and
Beallâ€™s List were examined using their publicly available journal lists.
The number of JUOJS in ROAD (2022) was determined by
Bianca Kramer, and SerpApi provided assistance in evaluating the indexing
of JUOJS in Google Scholar. For each index, representation of
JUOJS was assessed by measuring overlap through matched ISSNs and/or
matched journal URLs and domain names. The specific matching criteria
applied to each resource are detailed in Table 3.
