Teachers often seek to prevent, anticipate, and prepare for events
that may arise in the classroom (Taxer & Gross, 2018).
Even in situations where they have limited choice or influence,
teachers engage in emotion regulation to adjust both their own
emotional responses and those of their students (Akbari et al.,
2016). When preventive strategies are no longer feasible due to
insufficient resources or when faced with highly adverse circumstances, teachers
typically employ reactive strategies. This approach aims to control impulsive
actions associated with unwanted emotions and to mitigate their effects
(e.g., Sheppes, 2014; Sutton, 2004; Sutton et al., 2009; Taxer
& Gross, 2018). The evidence also suggests that the emotion
regulation process is cyclical, dynamic, and context-dependent, indicating that teachers
utilize a sequence of strategies to manage emotional modulation, consistent
with the Process Model of Emotion Regulation (Gross, 2015). Furthermore,
emotion regulation appears to be influenced by professional factors such
as area of expertise and career stage, as well as
by situational demands (Sheppes, 2014; English et al., 2017).
