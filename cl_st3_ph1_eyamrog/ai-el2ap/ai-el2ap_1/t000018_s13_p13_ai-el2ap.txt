The "simultaneous spatial synthesis" factor, also referred to as visuospatial
ability, is responsible for enabling individuals to accurately perceive and
locate motor actions in space, including directions such as up
or down, right or left, and depth perception (deep or
superficial). Consequently, lesions in the brain regions associated with this
function can impair or restrict the performance of tasks that
require spatial orientation, such as writing, changing lines while reading,
throwing a ball to a specific location, or copying a
drawing.
