From this perspective, instrumental and deterministic views of technology promote
practices that are misaligned with the educational goals of intellectual
and holistic development. These perspectives focus exclusively on technology as
a tool serving human needs, without considering its broader implications.
In educational contexts, while instruction in the operation of technological
tools is not inherently negative, it is inadequate for achieving
comprehensive educational objectives. Such instruction remains limited to practical application
and does not extend to conceptual understanding or the analysis
of socio-historical relationships. Moreover, teaching that is confined to operational
skills tends to reinforce static, everyday knowledge rather than fostering
critical or reflective thinking.
