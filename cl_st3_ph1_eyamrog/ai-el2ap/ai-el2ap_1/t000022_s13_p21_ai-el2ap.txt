Certain countries exhibit distinct authorship patterns in their academic journals.
In Brazil, for example, Medical and Health Sciences journals report
that single-author articles constitute 5% of publications, whereas articles with
4 to 8 authors account for 61.8%. This trend toward
multi-authored articles is consistent across other subject areas in Brazilian
journals. In contrast, Colombian journals display a higher proportion of
articles with two or three authors, diverging from the more
common pattern of 4 to 8 authors observed elsewhere. Specifically,
articles with two or three authors comprise 56.3% in Agricultural
Sciences, 41.7% in Medical and Health Sciences, 59.9% in Natural
and Exact Sciences, and 63.8% in Engineering and Technology. These
proportions in Colombian journals are substantially higher than the corresponding
averages for other countries presented in Table 3.
