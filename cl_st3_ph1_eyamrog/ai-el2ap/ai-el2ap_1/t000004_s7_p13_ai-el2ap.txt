Sandro described experiencing frequent physical bullying from other children at
school. He recounted that, while selling ice cream from a
trolley on the streets one day, he observed a group
of individuals in a local park engaging in activities such
as kicking, backflips, and cartwheels. Upon inquiring about their activity,
he was informed that they were practicing capoeira. When he
asked about the presence of an instructor, he was told
that there was no formal teacher; instead, participants with more
experience assisted others in learning. Sandro noted that this group
was the only one that offered him support without judgment
regarding his identity. (Interview with Sandro â€“ audio transcription)
