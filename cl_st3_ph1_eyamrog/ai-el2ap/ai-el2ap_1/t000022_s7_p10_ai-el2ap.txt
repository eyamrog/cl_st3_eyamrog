The OLIVA project database comprises data collected from journals indexed
by SciELO and Redalyc, as well as revised information from
published documents. Both indexing systems contributed their historical databases, updated
to June 2019. The data underwent cleaning and deduplication to
address overlapping journals. The resulting integrated bibliographic database is intended
for statistical analysis and includes, at the document level, information
on document type, publication date, language, and the authorâ€™s country.
Citation data are not included, as this falls outside the
scope of the project.
