In the state of Minas Gerais, the family Dennstaedtiaceae is
represented by 14 species, Lindsaeaceae by 11 species, and Saccolomataceae
by three species (Pena et al. 2020; Schwartsburd 2020; Schwartsburd
& Pena 2020; Schwartsburd 2022). In this study, we provide
a taxonomic treatment of these families for the region of
Viçosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil, as part of an ongoing project
on the fern flora of this region. Previous fascicles from
this project have been published, including Miranda & Schwartsburd (2016)
on Salviniales, Rabelo & Schwartsburd (2016) on Schizaeales, and Gonçalves
da Silva & Schwartsburd (2017) on Polypodiaceae, with additional fascicles
currently in preparation.
