Neither example demonstrates clear evidence of exploring or deepening students’
ideas. Instead, the teachers appeared to have specific objectives and
worked collaboratively with the students to achieve them. The teachers

perfume evaporation and in emphasizing a microscopic explanation of the
evaporation process. Student contributions were minimal and appeared to align
with the teachers’ line of reasoning.
