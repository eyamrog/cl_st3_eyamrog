While more than 70% of all interviewees reported having a
good or very good command of English for academic writing,
and 65% indicated prior international academic experience, the participant from
northern Brazil assessed his English academic writing skills as poor
and stated that he had never had any international experience.
This discrepancy may be attributable to various factors, including individual
circumstances. Notably, disparities in government investment in education across different
states in Brazil may also contribute to such differences.
