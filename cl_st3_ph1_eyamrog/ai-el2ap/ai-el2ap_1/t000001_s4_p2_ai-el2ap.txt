Although perfect bacterial genome assemblies are now achievable, their production
remains complex. Ongoing advancements in Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) chemistry,
basecalling algorithms, and polishing tools are expected to enhance assembly
quality; however, it is currently unclear whether these improvements will
be sufficient to achieve consistently perfect assemblies using ONT data
alone, thereby eliminating the need for supplementary Illumina reads. Additional
software development is required to eliminate manual intervention, facilitating fully
automated pipelines capable of generating high-quality assemblies even in challenging
scenarios, such as genomes exhibiting heterogeneity. The overarching objective is
to establish assembly methods that are sufficiently robust and user-friendly
to render the production of perfect genomes routine and unremarkable.
