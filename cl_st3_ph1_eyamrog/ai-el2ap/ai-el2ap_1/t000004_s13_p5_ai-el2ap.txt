Capoeira is believed to have originated under these conditions in
the northeastern state of Bahia, which was the center of
Brazil’s sugar-based economy and the location of its capital, Salvador
da Bahia. The precise time and circumstances of capoeira’s emergence
remain subjects of considerable debate. The earliest documented references to
capoeira date to the 19th century and include chronicle articles,
accounts from foreign visitors to Brazil, newspaper reports, and a
single engraving that may depict the practice of capoeira (de
Abreu, 2005).
