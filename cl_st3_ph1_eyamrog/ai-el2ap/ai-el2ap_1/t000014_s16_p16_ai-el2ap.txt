However, the majority of archival projects include at least some
speakers who do not interact directly with the archive and
may lack prior familiarity with archiving practices or their implications.
The “Kawahiva Language Documentation Archive” (Dos Santos, 2017–present) exemplifies this
situation; the collection, which is continuously developed, comprises audio and
video recordings of stories, conversations, songs, elicitation sessions, meetings, field
notes, and photographs. In this project, two speakers regularly record,
transcribe, and submit files for monthly archiving, which, according to
Dos Santos (personal communication), fosters a sense of ownership over
the archive among the contributors. Additionally, the depositor, Wesley dos
Santos, has produced a video to instruct community members on
how to access the materials through the California Language Archive.
