At least three key considerations are relevant to the adoption
of a research paradigm. First, the chosen paradigm should provide
a consistent and coherent framework throughout all stages of the
study (Taber, 2013, p. 55). Second, different paradigms are associated
with distinct purposes and methodologies, which in turn produce different
outcomes (p. 68). Third, every study is informed by a
paradigm, whether this is made explicit or remains implicit in
the formulation and investigation of the research questions (p. 68).
These considerations highlight the necessity of carefully evaluating the alignment
between research objectives and the selection of appropriate methodological approaches.
