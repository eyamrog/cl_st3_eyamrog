In summary, the two documentation projects described have resulted in
the establishment of the Paresi and Enenawe Nawe archival collections,
which are accessible to both the academic community and indigenous
community members. During the Covid-19 pandemic, such archival collections have
proven particularly valuable for researchers who were unable to conduct
fieldwork in indigenous communities. Furthermore, these collections contribute to the
preservation of traditional knowledge, a need that has become more
pressing due to the loss of many indigenous elders during
the pandemic. It remains essential to archive language documentation materials
that have not yet been deposited to ensure their long-term
preservation. A key future objective is to enhance the accessibility
of these collections for indigenous peoples in Brazil, thereby enabling
indigenous teachers to utilize the materials in community classrooms and
in academic contexts within indigenous higher education institutions.
