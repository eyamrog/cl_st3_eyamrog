These elements collectively constitute what is commonly referred to as
the research paradigm, which represents a fundamental worldview or set
of basic beliefs that determines the value attributed to research
and informs the investigatorâ€™s selection of methods as well as
underlying assumptions (Guba & Lincoln, 1994; Treagust et al., 2014).
The research paradigm functions as a conceptual framework or philosophical
stance that integrates beliefs, values, and methodological approaches within the
research process (Taber, 2013; Treagust et al., 2014). In practical
terms, paradigms shape the way researchers conceptualize and interpret their
studies.
