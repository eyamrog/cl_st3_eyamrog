While labour migration to England has been a significant and
established trend since the mid-twentieth century, large-scale migration to Northern
Ireland is a comparatively recent development. Notably, Northern Ireland began
to experience a marked increase in inward migration at the
beginning of the twenty-first century. According to Doyle and McAreavey
(2016, p. 52), between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, the
proportion of non-UK/Ireland migrants in Northern Ireland tripled, rising from
1.6% to 4.5% of the local population. Two primary political
developments contributed to this increase: first, the culmination of the
Peace Process in Northern Ireland on December 2, 1999, which
led to changes in the region’s political economy and attracted
inward investment in infrastructure; and second, the accession of several
Eastern European and Baltic states to the European Union from
2004, which facilitated labour migration from countries such as Poland
and Lithuania to both the Republic of Ireland and Northern
Ireland (Corrigan et al., 2015; Doyle & McAreavey, 2016). However,
following the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union on
31 January 2020, migration from the European Union to Northern
Ireland has been significantly restricted.
