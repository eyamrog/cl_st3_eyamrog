Several long-read assemblers suitable for bacterial genomes have been developed,
including Canu, Flye, NECAT, NextDenovo, and Raven, each employing distinct
algorithms that confer specific advantages and disadvantages. Regardless of the
assembler selected, most long-read bacterial genome assemblies contain avoidable errors,
and different assemblers applied to the same read set are
likely to generate assemblies with varying error profiles. Trycycler addresses
this issue by generating a consensus sequence from multiple alternative
assemblies of the same genome, which enables the reduction of
structural errors, the removal of spurious contigs, and the accurate
resolution of circular sequences without missing or duplicated bases at
their termini. Based on these capabilities, the use of Trycycler
is recommended for producing long-read bacterial genome assemblies. It should
be noted, however, that Trycycler is not fully automated and
requires user input and decision-making during the assembly process.
