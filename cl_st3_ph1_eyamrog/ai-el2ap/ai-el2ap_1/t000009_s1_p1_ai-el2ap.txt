This paper examines the advantages of utilizing information and communication
technologies (ICT) for conducting contextual target situation analysis at a
distance in the design of online Critical English for Academic
Purposes (CEAP) courses. It presents a contextual analysis of the
publishing process in high-impact computer science journals, with the objective
of identifying factors that may affect the publication success of
Brazilian researchers. The study investigates the beliefs and experiences of
Brazilian authors involved in this process through electronic questionnaires and
remote interviews. Additionally, the reviews of research articles were analyzed
to determine the criteria used by the academic community for
accepting or rejecting submissions. The use of ICT enabled a
broader contextual analysis by facilitating participation from individuals in various
geographic locations. The findings offer insights into the processes of
researching and publishing in the field, which can inform the
development of tasks aimed at enhancing students’ critical academic literacy.
For developing countries such as Brazil, the use of ICT
in the design of CEAP courses can result in time
and resource savings, thereby allowing for the provision of more
relevant instruction that better addresses students’ contextual needs and objectives.
