The results indicated that the leaf number of A. distichantha
bromeliads, whether in vegetative or reproductive stages and transplanted as
either terricolous or epiphytic forms, did not differ significantly (p
> 0.05) at any observation period during the experiment (Table
3). Therefore, neither the relocation form nor the phenological stage
had a significant effect on leaf production. However, in both
phenological stages and relocation forms, the number of leaves significantly
decreased (p > 0.05) after 252 days and then remained
stable until the end of the experiment. The observed reduction
in leaf number in A. distichantha and W. cyathiformis may
represent an adaptive response to abiotic stress, such as leaf
senescence during establishment in a new environment, as previously described
(Leopold 1975; Freitas et al. 1998). Although leaf sprouting is
a normal part of the bromeliad life cycle, environmental stress
may have accelerated this process. Additionally, many bromeliads, such as
Vriesea neoglutinosa Mez, cease leaf production and initiate new sprout
formation upon reaching maturity (Sampaio et al. 2002). Water deficit,
particularly during drought periods observed in July and September 2016
(Figure 2), may have contributed to reduced leaf emission across
all relocation forms. Despite leaf loss, survival rates remained high.
It is important to note that bromeliads can absorb water
both from the soil via the root system and from
water retained in leaf axils (Nievola & Mercier 1996). Although
the transplantation method used did not allow precise measurement of
new root emission, it is reasonable to assume that root
development contributed to mineral nutrient uptake, supporting adequate growth and
development.
