In the case of authors from Chile, 75% have published
in journals based in their own country, which, while a
substantial proportion, is lower compared to other national contexts. Chilean
authors also frequently submit to journals from Colombia, Brazil, and
Mexico, indicating these countries are significant regional publication venues. This
distribution pattern may be associated with the assessment practices of
Chilean academic institutions, which often discourage publishing in nationally edited
journals and instead provide direct incentives for international collaboration, as
previously discussed in relation to Figure 3. Conversely, authors from
Colombia, Cuba, and Mexico also tend to submit to journals
edited in their own countries, although not to the same
extent observed among Brazilian authors.
