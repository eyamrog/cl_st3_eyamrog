A critical approach to English for Academic Purposes (EAP) redefines
the roles of teachers and students, positioning teachers as transformative
practitioners (Morgan, 2009) and students as legitimate members of the
academic community who are also capable of acting as agents
of change (Benesch, 1996), rather than viewing them solely as
technicians and novice participants. In this context, Critical English for
Academic Purposes (CEAP) represents a valuable strategy in developing countries,
as it prepares university students not only for effective academic
communication but also for active engagement in the pursuit of
scientific equity.
