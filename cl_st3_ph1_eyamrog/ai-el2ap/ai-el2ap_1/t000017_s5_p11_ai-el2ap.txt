The internal consistency of the B-PREA-R demonstrated acceptable values for
a psychometric instrument comprising multiple subtests, with a Cronbach's alpha
of .85 and alpha values ranging from .83 to .86
when individual items were removed. The previous version of the
instrument also exhibited satisfactory internal consistency, with alpha values between
.78 and .81 when items were removed, and test-retest reliability
coefficients ranging from .82 to .94. Therefore, it is recommended
that future research include an assessment of internal consistency using
the test-retest method.
