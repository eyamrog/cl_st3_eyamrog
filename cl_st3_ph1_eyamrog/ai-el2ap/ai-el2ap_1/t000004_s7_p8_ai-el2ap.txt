The capoeira group provides several opportunities for the learning of
Portuguese. Participation in group activities exposes learners to authentic language
use in both formal and informal contexts, including instructions, songs,
and conversations. The group environment encourages interaction with native speakers,
facilitating the development of listening and speaking skills. Additionally, the
cultural practices associated with capoeira, such as music and rituals,
introduce learners to specific vocabulary and expressions relevant to Brazilian
Portuguese. Overall, the capoeira group serves as a context-rich setting
that supports language acquisition through meaningful social engagement and cultural
immersion.
