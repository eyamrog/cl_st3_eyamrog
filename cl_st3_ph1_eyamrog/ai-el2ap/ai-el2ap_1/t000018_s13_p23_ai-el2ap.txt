From this perspective, the analysis of activity through neuropsychological factors
and the application of evaluative methods proposed by Luria can
be effectively utilized in preschool education. In psychological sciences, Luria's
theory serves as a foundation for assessing children with neurodevelopmental
disorders, highlighting the importance of neuropsychological factors in explaining the
maturation of brain regions associated with mental development. In the
field of education, these neuropsychological factors are employed to examine
conceptual, attitudinal, and procedural content in preschool children, which constitute
key pedagogical foundations and support the implementation of a comprehensive
educational approach.
