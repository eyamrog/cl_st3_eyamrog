Plant relocation following vegetation removal is a significant conservation strategy.
This study aimed to evaluate the simultaneous relocation of the
bromeliads Aechmea distichantha Lem. and Wittrockia cyathiformis (Vell.) Leme in
both epiphytic and terricolous forms. Individuals of these species were
collected from areas cleared for highway construction and subsequently transplanted
either onto tree trunks or forks, or directly into the
soil within a Montane Dense Ombrophilous Forest in Parque Estadual
da Cantareira, SÃ£o Paulo State, Brazil. After one year, A.
distichantha exhibited a 100% survival rate when transplanted as terricolous
and 83.33% as epiphytic, whereas W. cyathiformis showed a 60%
survival rate in both forms. These results indicate that both
species can be successfully relocated as either epiphytes or terricolous
plants. Additionally, direct transplantation into the soil is more practical,
as suitable trees with accessible forks for manual attachment are
limited in availability.
