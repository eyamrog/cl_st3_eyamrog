Sandro emphasized that the movements should be fluid, resembling the
unsteady motions characteristic of intoxication. He explained that older mestres
would sometimes feign drunkenness to appear harmless. According to Sandro,
individuals would approach these mestres and invite them to play,
offering money as an incentive. The mestres would accept the
money and subsequently demonstrate their superior skill by decisively outperforming
their challengers. During this explanation, Sandro moved around the room
with an unsteady gait before abruptly executing several highly precise
attacks (Fieldnotes).
