This section focuses on the systematic coding method, which is
widely used by researchers to analyze interaction as a turn-taking
system and to categorize each instance of interaction. In this
approach, the analytic process involves reducing discursive data by marking
relevant points that align with the research objectives. This procedure,
commonly referred to as ‘coding,’ allows researchers to organize and
structure the data, translate raw data into specific conceptual references,
and identify connections between different categories (Evans, 2013, pp. 158–159).
Objectivity is essential in systematic coding, as it requires the
development of an unambiguous coding scheme; the criteria for coding
must be sufficiently clear to ensure that different observers assign
the same code or category to each discursive unit (Galton
et al., 1980). Codes are often derived from an existing
theoretical framework or previous research. When the analytical framework is
informed by a theoretical perspective from the outset, the research
can be described as ‘template’ analysis, as the analyst has
predefined criteria for identifying relevant data (Robson, 2002; Taber, 2013,
p. 293).
