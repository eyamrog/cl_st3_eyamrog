The research was conducted over three sessions, each lasting between
45 and 60 minutes, with a 5-minute rest period provided
as needed by the children. During the first session, the
Raven's Progressive Matrices test was administered, while the Luria Initial
Neuropsychological Battery was conducted in the second and third sessions.
This distribution was designed to minimize mental fatigue and reduce
the risk of decreased motivation associated with prolonged testing.
