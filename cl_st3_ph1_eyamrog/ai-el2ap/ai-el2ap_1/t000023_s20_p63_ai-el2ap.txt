According to Bicudo et al. (2019), Cosmarium trilobulatum var. abscissum
is distinguished from the typical variety by its broader lateral
lobes and a wider apical lobe, characteristics that correspond to
the specimens examined in the present study. Although this variety
closely resembles Cosmarium pseudoretusum F. Ducellier, it can be differentiated
by its less prominent apex.
