In ecological communities, interactions among individuals of different species play
a central role in shaping population dynamics (Macarthur 1955; Jordano
2016) and evolutionary processes (Drossel et al. 2001; Guimarães et
al. 2011), thereby influencing the maintenance of biodiversity at the
community level (Paine 1966; Fontaine et al. 2006; Hale et
al. 2020). These interactions frequently give rise to ecological networks,
in which species are connected through direct or indirect interactions
(Pascual & Dunne 2006; Jordano et al. 2006). Various types
of interactions, including mutualisms between plants and their seed dispersers
or pollinators (Bascompte et al. 2003), predator-prey relationships among mammals
(Pires & Guimarães 2013), facilitative interactions among plant species (Verdú
2010), and cleaning interactions among fish (Guimarães et al. 2007),
contribute to the formation of species-rich networks that exhibit a
range of nonrandom structural patterns. Notable among these patterns are
nestedness (e.g., Guimarães et al. 2007; Bascompte et al. 2003)
and modularity (e.g., Olesen et al. 2007).
