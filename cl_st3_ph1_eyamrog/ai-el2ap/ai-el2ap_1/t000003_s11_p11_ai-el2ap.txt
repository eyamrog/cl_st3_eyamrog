Accordingly, the broader research project examines the various social environments
navigated by the young Timorese migrants who participate in this
study. While the primary focus of this paper is on
the spaces of conviviality that these individuals establish within their
local contexts, the formation of multiple identities within these contexts,
and the use of digital resources to communicate these practices
and identities to family and friends in Timor-Leste, the larger
project also considers their everyday experiences in small-town settings and
their efforts to access different workplaces. Additionally, the study investigates
how these migrants are positioned within workplace environments, with particular
attention to the language resources and funds of knowledge they
possess.
