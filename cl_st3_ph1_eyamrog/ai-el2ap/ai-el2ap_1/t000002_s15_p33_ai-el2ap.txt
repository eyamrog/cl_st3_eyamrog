While ‘exploring explanations’ involved advancing, extending, and elaborating on students’
ideas, ‘guiding explanations’ referred to instructional sequences directed toward the
scientific explanation, including efforts to use scientific terminology with greater
precision. These two categories were further subdivided into four more
specific typologies. Finally, ‘providing explanations’ described sequences in which the
teacher delivered explanations directly to the students. In this sample
of talk-intensive lessons, such direct instruction was highly interactive, with
students contributing occasionally, although the teacher was primarily responsible for
the conceptual development.
