The dehydration effect in plant organs composed primarily of parenchymal
tissues has been recently documented (Caliaro et al. 2013, Kampowski
et al. 2018). These studies demonstrated that water loss in
petioles and hypocotyls leads to a reduction in bending stiffness.
In contrast, for stems and woody roots of self-supporting plants,
which are mainly composed of fibers and conducting cells (vessels
and/or tracheids), dehydration results in increased bending stiffness, thereby making
branches more brittle (Niklas 1992, Wang & Wang 1999, Niklas
& Spatz 2010, Boldrin et al. 2018). For instance, in
Picea sitchensis, a 23% decrease in bending stiffness is observed
when the moisture content increases from 12% to 24% in
woody stems (Niklas 1992). Overall, the present results are consistent
with previous findings in trees and extend this analysis to
liana stems. Furthermore, the effect size of stem dehydration on
bending stiffness in A. crucigerum is six times smaller than
that reported for Picea sitchensis stems. This reduced change in
bending stiffness with dehydration in liana stems may be attributed
to their distinctive anatomical structure. Lianas typically possess wide vessels,
fewer fibers, and a higher proportion of parenchyma cells and
soft tissue, which enhances water storage capacity (Tyree & Yang
1990, Campanello et al. 2016) and results in more compliant
stems (Rowe 2018, Gerolamo et al. 2020). Specifically, A. crucigerum
exhibits phloem wedges, large vessels, and wide rays, as shown
in Figure 1, which contribute to increased stem flexibility and
mitigate the impact of dehydration.
