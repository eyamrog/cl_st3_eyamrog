Of the 6,086 research articles published between 2011 and 2016
in the seven journals analyzed, 67 were authored or co-authored
by 127 Brazilian researchers. Table 2 displays the number of
articles published by each journal during the study period, as
well as the number of Brazilian researchers involved. In cases
where author contact information was not available in the published
article, the Google search engine was used to locate their
profiles in the Brazilian Lattes database for researchers and institutions.
Subsequently, each author was contacted via email and invited to
participate in the study by completing an online questionnaire hosted
on Google Docs; the email included a direct link to
the questionnaire.
