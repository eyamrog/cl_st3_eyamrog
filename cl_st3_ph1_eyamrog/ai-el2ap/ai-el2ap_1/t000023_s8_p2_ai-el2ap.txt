The genus Cosmarium has been documented globally in numerous taxonomic
surveys. From classical 19th-century literature (e.g., Brébisson 1856; Lundell 1871;
Nordstedt & Wittrock 1876; Ralfs 1848; West & G.S. West
1895) to more recent studies, records of Cosmarium have been
reported from various countries, including Nigeria (Biswas & Nweze 1990),
Colombia (Duque & Donato 1996), Canada (Elster et al. 1997),
Bangladesh (Islam & Irfanullah 2006), India (Dhande & Jawale 2009;
Bansod & Patil 2019), the Czech Republic (Šťastný 2009), and
South Korea (Lee 2015), among others. In Brazil, over 600
Cosmarium taxa have been recorded (Biolo & Bicudo 2018), with
the genus being particularly well-studied in the southern region, where
numerous taxonomic investigations have documented its occurrence in both phytoplankton
and periphyton of reservoirs and rivers. Recent floristic studies in
Brazil have reported the presence of Cosmarium in several states,
including Paraná (Silva & Cecy 2004; Bortolini et al. 2010;
Felisberto & Rodrigues 2010; Biolo et al. 2013; Menezes et
al. 2011; Carvalho et al. 2015; Moresco et al. 2015;
Aquino et al. 2016; Osório et al. 2018; Rodrigues &
Moresco 2021), São Paulo (Bicudo et al. 2019; Felisberto &
Rodrigues 2010), Bahia (Oliveira et al. 2010; Oliveira et al.
2011; Oliveira et al. 2016; Ramos et al. 2018; Ramos
et al. 2021), Goiás (Felisberto & Rodrigues 2004), Distrito Federal
(Estrela et al. 2011), Amazonas (Saturnino et al. 2020), Sergipe
(Burle et al. 2020), Mato Grosso, and Rio de Janeiro
(Kanetsuna 2004). In the past decade, five new Cosmarium species
have been described from Brazilian material: Cosmarium bahianum G.J.P.Ramos, C.E.M.Bicudo
& C.W.N.Moura; Cosmarium bromelicola G.J.P.Ramos, C.E.M.Bicudo & C.W.N.Moura; Cosmarium diamantinum
G.J.P.Ramos & C.W.N.Moura; Cosmarium imperiale G.J.P.Ramos & C.W.N.Moura; and Cosmarium
oliveirae G.J.P.Ramos, C.E.M.Bicudo & C.W.N.Moura, along with several new taxonomic
varieties. Despite the presence of one of Brazil’s most significant
coastal lake systems (Barroso et al. 2012), the algal flora
of Espírito Santo State has received limited attention. To date,
Delazari-Barroso et al. (2007) remains the only floristic study documenting
the genus in Espírito Santo, reporting four Cosmarium taxa: Cosmarium
asphaerosporum var. strigosum Nordstedt, Cosmarium cf. capitulum J.Roy & Bisset,
Cosmarium pseudobroomei Wolle, and Cosmarium pseudoconnatum Nordstedt.
