Multivariate normality was assessed by estimating skewness and kurtosis indices;
the assumption of normality was considered satisfied when the values
of these indices fell within the threshold of Â±1.5 (Cuadras,
2016) (see Table 4). Additionally, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test yielded
a value of 0.81, indicating that the data were suitable
for factor analysis.
