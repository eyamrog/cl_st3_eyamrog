In Brazil, pedagogical discourse related to technology is largely characterized
by instrumental and deterministic perspectives (Peixoto & Ara√∫jo, 2012). The
instrumental view regards information and communication technologies (ICT) in education
primarily as didactic tools, subordinate to human control. In contrast,
the deterministic perspective attributes a dominant role to technology, positioning
it as a solution to educational challenges. According to these
viewpoints, shortcomings in school education are attributed either to teachers'
insufficient technological proficiency or to the lack of comprehensive technological
integration within schools, which is presumed to be transformative. These
approaches tend to attribute responsibility solely to individual actors, neglecting
the broader social contexts of students and their families, absolving
public authorities of their responsibilities, and failing to critically examine
the underlying reasons for institutional choices in educational settings.
