The presence of multiple research paradigms is not inherently problematic,
particularly in the context of educational research. Treagust et al.
(2014) argue that such diversity facilitates the development of more
comprehensive knowledge and encourages broader scholarly engagement. Similarly, Taber (2013)
recognizes that each paradigm possesses distinct strengths and limitations, indicating
that all paradigms are capable of generating valuable insights and
may be utilized in complementary ways.
