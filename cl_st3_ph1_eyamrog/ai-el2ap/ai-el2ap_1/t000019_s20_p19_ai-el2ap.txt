Significant investments were made in public spaces providing access to
computers and the internet, particularly between 2002 and 2012 (Bueno,
2017). However, in recent years, only 45% of these facilities
remain operational, and their conditions are inadequate, similar to those
observed in schools (CGI.br, 2018b, 2019b). These public spaces include
libraries and technology centers, such as the Educational Technology Center
(NTE). For several years, these venues were accessible to the
public at no cost, allowing individuals to conduct internet research,
print utility bills, enroll in public services and tenders, and
access various digital services. Additionally, basic computer courses were offered
to both community members and teachers (Bueno, 2017). Although these
locations were not the primary resource for students, they provided
important supplementary support for both students and the broader population.
