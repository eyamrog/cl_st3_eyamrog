There is a relationship between the country affiliation of authors
and the language of publication. Articles authored exclusively by researchers
from outside Latin America and the Caribbean, which constitute 8.5%
of the 643,929 articles with identified country affiliation, account for
16.9% of the articles published in English. Additionally, articles produced
through collaboration between at least one author from the region
and one from outside the region represent 4.7% of the
total articles. In both authorship categories, English is the predominant
language of publication, comprising 49.9% of articles resulting from international
collaboration (30,307 articles) and 52.4% of articles authored solely by
researchers from outside the region (54,700 articles).
