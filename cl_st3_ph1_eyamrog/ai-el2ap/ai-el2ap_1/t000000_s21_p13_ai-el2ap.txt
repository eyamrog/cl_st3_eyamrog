Rhizomes are short-creeping and bear primitive scales. Leaves are small
to medium-sized, approximately 20 cm to 1 m in length,
with laminae ranging from simple to 3-pinnate. Indument is either
absent or consists of two-celled glandular hairs. Veins are generally
free. Sori are marginal or submarginal, elongate, and borne on
commissural veins. The inner indusia are modified and elongate, whereas
the outer indusia are unmodified (Smith et al. 2006).
