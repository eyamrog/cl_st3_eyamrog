According to data from the National Institute for Educational Studies
and Research “Anísio Teixeira” (INEP), as reported by the website
Terra (n.d.), the state of Amazonas in northern Brazil invested
R$ 3,075.89 per student annually, whereas Santa Catarina, a southern
state, invested R$ 6,829.52 per student. Given the complexity of
educational systems, it cannot be conclusively stated that students from
the North are less prepared for international academic writing than
those from the South solely due to differences in public
education funding. Nevertheless, contextual factors such as economic and political
conditions should be taken into account during the needs analysis
for courses in English for Academic Purposes (CEAP). As demonstrated
in this study, information and communication technologies (ICT) can assist
teachers and course developers in remotely investigating how these contextual
factors affect specific educational environments.
