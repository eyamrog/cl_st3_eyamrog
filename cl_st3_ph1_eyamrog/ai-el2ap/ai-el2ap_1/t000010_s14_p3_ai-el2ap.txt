The Raven's Progressive Matrices Intelligence Test comprises 36 problems presented
in a paper booklet, each featuring an incomplete figure that
the participant is required to complete. This test is widely
recognized for assessing fluid intelligence. The Cuban norms established by
Ramírez et al. (2017) were applied in this study. The
instrument demonstrates adequate reliability within the Cuban context, with analysis
indicating that 91% of the items possess good item-total discrimination
indices (Ramírez et al., 2017).
