The data indicate that both urban and rural schools in
Brazil face significant physical and technological limitations that hinder the
effective pedagogical integration of digital information and communication technologies (DICT),
with rural schools experiencing even greater challenges. Although 64% of
urban public schools reportedly have computer laboratories, these facilities are
generally inadequate in terms of capacity, as they are unable
to accommodate a typical class size of 30 students. Specifically,
78% of these laboratories are equipped with fewer than six
computers, and only 9% possess slightly more than 21 computers
(CGI.br, 2018b, 2019b). Furthermore, most classes in the second phase
of elementary education in Brazil consist of more than 35
students, exacerbating the mismatch between available resources and actual classroom
needs.
