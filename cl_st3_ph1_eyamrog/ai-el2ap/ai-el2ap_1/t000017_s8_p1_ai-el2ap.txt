Cognitive development during early childhood is a critical determinant of
subsequent educational trajectories and is associated with academic and occupational
outcomes in adulthood (Doebel, 2020). In many low- and middle-income
countries in Latin America, over half of children exhibit delays
in cognitive proficiency upon entering primary education (Abufhele et al.,
2021; Borrescio & Valenzuela, 2021; Vollman & Richland, 2020). These
delays are linked to insufficient school readiness and increased challenges
in academic settings. Additionally, recent decades have seen a rise
in the prevalence of learning and behavioral disorders related to
disruptions in early cognitive development (Albes et al., 2021). Early
identification of cognitive development difficulties is essential to enable timely
interventions and to mitigate persistent disparities in academic achievement, socioeconomic
status, and social mobility. Despite this need, there is a
lack of culturally validated assessment instruments for cognitive development in
Latin America. The present study addresses this gap by focusing
on the Cuban context, where the promotion of optimal cognitive
development in early childhood is a priority for both educators
and researchers.
