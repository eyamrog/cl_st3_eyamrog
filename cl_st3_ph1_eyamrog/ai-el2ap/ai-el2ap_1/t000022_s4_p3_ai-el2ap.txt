The analysis of collaboration structures within the OLIVA corpus addressed
the complexities of national collaboration by differentiating between co-authorships within
the same institution and those involving multiple universities, particularly across
different states. This approach enabled an examination of the geospatial
dynamics of national scientific production. Focusing on Brazil, which accounts
for one-third of the journals and approximately half of the
authors and articles in the OLIVA database, the results indicate
a high level of collaboration among researchers from different states.
Additionally, the analysis identified states that, due to their prominence,
play a central role in the corpus while also maintaining
substantial collaborative relationships with colleagues from states that have a
comparatively smaller presence in the Brazilian scientific system.
