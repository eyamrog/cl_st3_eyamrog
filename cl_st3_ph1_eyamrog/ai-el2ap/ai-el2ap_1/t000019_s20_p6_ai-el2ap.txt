The document is notable for its lack of critical analysis,
as it affirms digital culture as a determining factor and
presumes that the population is already digitally included. This uncritical
stance toward technology can be attributed to the adoption of
deterministic and instrumental perspectives, which either present technologies as definitive
solutions to societal problems or shift responsibility onto individuals regarding
their use or non-use of these technologies (Feenberg, 2003), without
considering whether individuals possess the necessary skills to engage with
them effectively.
