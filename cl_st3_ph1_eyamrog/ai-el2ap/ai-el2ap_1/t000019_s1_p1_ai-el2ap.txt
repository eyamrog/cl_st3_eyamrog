The recommendation to integrate Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) into
Basic Education in Brazil has become increasingly prominent with each
curricular reform, based on the argument that such knowledge is
essential for active participation in the 21st century. The Covid-19
pandemic in 2020 further accelerated the adoption of these technologies
to support various forms of education, commonly referred to as
emergency remote education. In this context, the present article aims
to examine the conceptualization of technology within the basic education
curriculum and the actual conditions of access to ICT. To
this end, a literature review and documentary analysis were conducted.
The study analyzed the National Common Curricular Base (BNCC) for
Brazilian education and data from the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee
census regarding ICT access in schools and households. Findings from
research conducted in public schools over the past eight years
have already highlighted insufficient investment in technology and inadequate teacher
training for ICT use in these institutions. The increased visibility
during the pandemic merely brought wider public attention to the
longstanding deficiencies in Brazilian public schools. The prevailing theoretical approach
in the BNCC is instrumental rather than holistic. Although national
curriculum guidelines increasingly advocate for the use of ICT in
educational settings, the current level of investment in both human
and technological resources remains insufficient, even for limited instrumental instruction,
despite the recognized social relevance of the issue.
