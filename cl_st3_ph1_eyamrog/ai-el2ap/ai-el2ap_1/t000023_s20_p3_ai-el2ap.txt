This variety exhibited substantial morphological plasticity, particularly in the length-to-width
ratio and the shape of the lateral margins. Bicudo (1988)
discussed the polymorphism observed in Cosmarium abbreviatum var. minus and
its implications for the taxonomic identification of small desmids, suggesting
a high likelihood that several taxa, including Cosmarium succisum G.S.West
var. jaoi Willi Krieger & Gerloff and C. abbreviatum var.
minus, may represent morphological variants of a single species. The
specimens examined in the present study demonstrated the same range
of morphological variation as reported in the referenced literature.
