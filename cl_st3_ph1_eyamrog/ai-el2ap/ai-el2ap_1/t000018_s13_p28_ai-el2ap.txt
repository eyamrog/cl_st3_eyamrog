Luria and his followers proposed a method for evaluation that
addresses the question of how to assess individuals. This method
involves the use of observation, interviews, and specific tests, with
the analysis of results based on neuropsychological factors that serve
as indicators for interpreting human actions and the effects of
neurological damage. However, when this approach is applied within the
field of education, the focus shifts away from syndromic analysis.
Instead, educators are guided to assess the overall development of
the child using evaluative methods common in educational practice, such
as observation and the analysis of pedagogical situations.
