Computer ownership in Brazilian households reached 56% in the years
prior to 2016 but currently remains below 40% among households
with public school students (CGI.br, 2018, 2019a). Data from 2011
to 2019 indicate that the increased accessibility of cell phones
has corresponded with a decline in computer ownership, likely due
to households opting for cell phones over computers. This preference
is attributed to the lower cost, communicative capabilities, and greater
portability of cell phones. Consequently, Internet usage has increased primarily
through cell phones, while the number of computers per household,
as well as the availability of public telecenters and school
computer labs, has declined.
