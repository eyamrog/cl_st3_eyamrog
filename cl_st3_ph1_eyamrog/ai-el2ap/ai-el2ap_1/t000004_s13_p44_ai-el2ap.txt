The class begins with Sandro assembling the students in a
circle, during which the history and culture of capoeira are
typically discussed. The songs are used as an entry point
for these discussions, as many have evolved over centuries and
contain numerous historical and cultural references. Since the songs are
performed in Portuguese and include some African linguistic elements, they
also facilitate discussions about language. In this context, Sandro explains
the multiple meanings associated with references to snakes in one
of the songs.
