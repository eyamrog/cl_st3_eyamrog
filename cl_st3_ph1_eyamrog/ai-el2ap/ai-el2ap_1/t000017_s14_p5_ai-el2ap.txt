The Pre-Academic Battery for Educators (B-PREA-R) was utilized in this
study. This instrument is based on the original Pre-Academic Battery
developed in Cuba to assess the cognitive development of preschool-aged
children within the Cuban context (Ram√≠rez et al., 2018). The
B-PREA-R comprises nine subtests, encompassing a total of 199 items
that evaluate various cognitive abilities, including attention, language, working memory,
numerical cognitive processing, motor skills, and thinking. These subtests facilitate
the assessment of children's cognitive development through activities characteristic of
the preschool stage, such as drawing, listening to stories, and
role-playing. The activities are designed to measure the skills and
knowledge associated with each educational and developmental dimension as specified
by the methodological guidelines for the enhancement of early childhood
education in Cuba (Gallo et al., 2018), as detailed in
Table 2.
