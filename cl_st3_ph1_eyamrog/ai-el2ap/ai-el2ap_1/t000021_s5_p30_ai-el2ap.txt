The results of this study indicate that emotion regulation strategies
cannot be classified as inherently "good" or "bad," although some
may be considered more adaptive in certain contexts (Gross, 2015).
The effectiveness and appropriateness of these strategies depend on various
factors, including the specific context, available resources, anticipated outcomes, and
the temporal scope of their effects (immediate or long-term) (Aldao
et al., 2015; Gross, 2015; English et al., 2017). From
a contextual perspective, the form and function of the strategies
employed by teachers align with the second generation of emotion
regulation research, which emphasizes situational variability. This perspective highlights that
each strategy entails both costs and benefits, and therefore, categorizing
them as adaptive or maladaptive without considering context may be
inconsistent. Furthermore, these findings support the view of Sheppes (2014)
and Aldao et al. (2015) that effective emotion regulation is
characterized by the flexible selection of strategies in response to
varying emotional demands.
