English for Academic Purposes (EAP) has been effectively applied to
the teaching of academic discourse for both native and non-native
students. Because it addresses the specialized language required for academic
contexts, EAP is often considered essential for preparing students for
academic communication. However, in many countries, including the United States,
EAP is frequently perceived as a subordinate service discipline whose
primary function is to facilitate students’ communication within academic settings
(Benesch, 2001). To address this marginalization, the critical perspective of
EAP (CEAP) seeks to highlight the complexity of language teaching
and learning in higher education and to demonstrate the capacity
of EAP pedagogy to foster students’ social awareness in addition
to their linguistic competence.
