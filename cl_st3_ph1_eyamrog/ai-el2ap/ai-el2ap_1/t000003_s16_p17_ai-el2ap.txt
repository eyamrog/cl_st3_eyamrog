Timorese migrants arriving in Dungannon or other nearby towns typically
secure employment in one of the regionâ€™s factories. The largest
facility, Moy Park, is located in Dungannon and specializes in
the processing and packaging of chicken products for supermarket distribution.
Although Moy Park was originally an Irish company, fieldwork conducted
in 2015 revealed that it had been owned by a
Brazilian corporation since 2010, reflecting the increasingly globalized nature of
food production in the area. Additionally, two smaller factories in
Cookstown focus on packaging pork and cheese for the retail
sector (Interview with DA, in Tetum, June 2015). The region
also includes a rendering plant that produces animal feed (Joint
interview with RS and HA, June 2015).
