Porto et al. (2021) demonstrated the significance of parental language
and its impact on the neuropsychological development of children. These
authors suggest that parental educational level is a reliable predictor
of positive developmental outcomes in children and can be used
to distinguish between children with varying conditions. While this perspective
is well-supported, it was not the primary focus of the
present study. In Cuba, according to the most recent population
census, 70% of adults are professionals. Consequently, parental educational level
may not adequately explain the observed differences between the Cienfuegos
and Santi Sp√≠ritus groups. Nevertheless, this variable warrants further examination,
as highly educated or professional parents may have limited time
and may delegate aspects of their child's education to non-professional
caregivers.
