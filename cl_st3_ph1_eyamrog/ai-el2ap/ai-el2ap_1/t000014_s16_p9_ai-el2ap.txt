To support the documentation of indigenous languages in Brazil, linguists
at the Goeldi Museum provide intensive training on relevant technologies
and methodologies, including recommendations for equipment. This training is also
extended to members of indigenous communities. Additionally, the archive offers
digitization and storage services for legacy audio recordings (see ยง5
below). For instance, the Goeldi team is currently collaborating with
an anthropologist to digitize a collection of 115 cassette tapes
(both sides) containing recordings of two Nambikwara dialects. These recordings,
some of which date back to the 1970s, include music,
a dictionary, conversations, and minimal tone pairs. The materials are
being digitized and, in cooperation with the anthropologist, will be
catalogued and deposited in the digital linguistic archive. The anthropologist
will receive copies in .mp3 format, which require minimal storage
space and can be shared with Nambikwara communities. The original
cassette tapes may either be deposited in the archive or
returned to the researcher. Individuals interested in these services are
encouraged to contact the Goeldi Linguistics Area (linguistica@museu-goeldi.br).
