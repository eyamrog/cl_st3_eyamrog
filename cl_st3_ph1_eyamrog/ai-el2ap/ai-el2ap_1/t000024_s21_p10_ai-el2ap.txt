The results suggest that A. distichantha may exhibit greater adaptability
following relocation compared to W. cyathiformis. Nevertheless, the survival rates
observed for both species were consistent with those previously reported
for other relocated bromeliads. Additionally, the form of relocation implemented
for these species (i.e., epiphytic or terrestrial) may influence the
attraction of pollinators, seed production, and the establishment of new
populations. W. cyathiformis is a facultative bromeliad that is visited
by birds (Cestari 2009) and pollinated by hummingbirds (Kaehler et
al. 2005), while A. distichantha, also facultative (Mania 2010), can
be pollinated by either bees or hummingbirds (Scrok & Varassin
2011). With respect to pollination, Varassin and Sazima (2000) documented
the hummingbirds Phaethornis eurynome and Ramphodon naevius pollinating bromeliads in
the lower strata of the forest.
