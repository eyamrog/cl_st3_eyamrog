Prior to the practical component of the class, Sandro or
one of the students plays recorded capoeira music. The practical
session sometimes begins with a warm-up, during which students individually
perform ginga movements while following Sandro and facing the same
direction. A significant portion of the session is also dedicated
to practicing in pairs. In the practical part of Sandro’s
classes, there is a noticeable shift from the predominantly verbal
communication characteristic of the theoretical component to increased reliance on
communication through physical movement, which is consistently synchronized with the
rhythm of the music. When spoken communication is used, it
primarily serves instructional purposes and is frequently accompanied by demonstrations
of the corresponding physical movements, facilitating comprehension through a combination
of verbal and non-verbal cues. Exercises are segmented into smaller
parts to enhance clarity, with verbal instructions provided in conjunction
with the physical activity. Sandro’s initial verbal instruction (“troca” –
change) is followed by a brief pause during which he
maintains the position he expects students to replicate. Subsequent instructions
(“rolê” – roll, “troca” – change) are delivered immediately before
the corresponding movements. These instructions are deictic and can only
be accurately interpreted when paired with the demonstrated action. Although
the instructions are given in Portuguese, comprehension is not hindered
due to the simultaneous demonstration of the movements.
