Therefore, initiatives that improve students' access to knowledge about the
digital world and digital culture practices should be prioritized, as
they have a direct or indirect impact on students' daily
lives across various social contexts and foster their interest in
and identification with digital information and communication technologies (DICT). The
integration of these technologies in educational settings facilitates both technical
and critical engagement with digital resources and contributes to meaningful
and autonomous student learning (BNCC, 2017, p. 487, emphasis added).
