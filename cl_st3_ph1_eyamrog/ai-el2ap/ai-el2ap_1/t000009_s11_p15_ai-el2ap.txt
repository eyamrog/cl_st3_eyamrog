For distance education in large territories such as Brazil, conducting
in-person procedures can be time-consuming and resource-intensive; however, these challenges
can be addressed by utilizing information and communication technologies (ICT)
for data collection, as proposed in this study. The following
two sections present a contextual task and situation analysis (TSA)
for the design of an online CEAP course intended for
Brazilian computer science graduate students. Particular emphasis is placed on
the use of ICT for data collection and its role
in facilitating the investigation of critical issues in a remote
context.
