Cosmarium galeritum var. subtumidum is distinguished from the nominate variety
by its more rounded semicells, as described by Borge (1903).
The specimen examined in this study exhibited a rounded to
slightly truncate apex, a morphological characteristic consistent with the variation
depicted in Borgeâ€™s (1903) illustration, which served as the basis
for its identification.
