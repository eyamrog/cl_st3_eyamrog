Regarding information and communication technologies (ICT), although many individuals use
cell phones on a daily basis, a significant proportion are
unable to perform basic tasks such as accessing their email
on a computer. This is often due to a lack
of understanding of fundamental concepts such as browsers, websites, or
email accounts, as well as uncertainty about login credentials. On
mobile devices, these functions are typically accessed through applications that
are already installed and require minimal technical knowledge for routine
use. However, familiarity with everyday use does not equate to
proficiency or the ability to utilize these tools effectively in
more complex contexts, such as professional or academic settings, which
may demand a higher level of digital literacy (Souza et
al., 2020; Peixoto, 2010).
