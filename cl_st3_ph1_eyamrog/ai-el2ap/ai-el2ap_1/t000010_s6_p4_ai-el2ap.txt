Building on this idea, Fernández-Hernández et al. (2022) found that
limited parental participation in recreational and sports activities with their
children is associated with a negative impact on the development
of executive functions in those children. This raises relevant questions
regarding the frequency and types of play activities that parents
in Cienfuegos and Espiritu engage in with their children. Addressing
these questions may help to explain some of the findings
of the present study and suggests potential directions for future
research on the development of executive functions in preschool children.
