Learning through capoeira can be understood as a process that
integrates verbal, embodied, and musical elements into a cohesive assemblage.
This approach recognizes that capoeira is not solely a physical
activity but also involves the use of language, music, and
movement, each contributing to the overall learning experience. Verbal communication
occurs through the exchange of instructions, songs, and dialogue among
participants, facilitating the transmission of cultural knowledge and technical skills.
Embodied learning is evident in the physical execution of movements,
the development of motor skills, and the adaptation to the
dynamic interactions within the roda. Musical components, including rhythm, melody,
and instrumentation, provide structure and context, guiding the tempo and
style of play while reinforcing communal bonds. Together, these elements
form an interconnected system in which learning is distributed across
multiple modalities, highlighting the complex and multifaceted nature of capoeira
as a practice.
