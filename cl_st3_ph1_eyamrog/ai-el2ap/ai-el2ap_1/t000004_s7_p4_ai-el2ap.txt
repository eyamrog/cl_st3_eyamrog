The concept of assemblage facilitates the analysis of how diverse
semiotic resources collectively function as a spatial repertoire, contributing to
the effectiveness of an activity without privileging language as the
exclusive or superior medium. Assemblage challenges the traditional focus on
non-verbal resources in multimodality research by emphasizing that semiotic resources
are not compartmentalized into distinct modes (Canagarajah, 2018, p. 39).
