Overall, water treatments had a positive effect on germination. Freshly
harvested pyrenes achieved 100% germination following immersion in water for
48 and 72 hours (Figure 2a). Stored pyrenes exhibited 32%
germination after 24 hours of soaking, increasing to approximately 50%
after 48 and 72 hours (Figure 2b). Water treatments of
48 and 72 hours also reduced the mean germination time
(MGT) of freshly harvested pyrenes to around 20 days, compared
to 25 days in the control group (Figure 2c), indicating
faster germination. In contrast, no significant differences in mean germination
time were observed among treatments for stored pyrenes (Figure 2d).
Therefore, immersion in water for two to three days enhances
the germination of freshly harvested C. alba pyrenes, which may
facilitate more rapid germination and seedling establishment in nursery settings.
The number of seeds germinated per day, as measured by
the speed index, was also increased by water immersion for
48 and 72 hours, particularly in freshly harvested pyrenes (Figure
2e). Similar positive effects of water immersion pretreatments on germination
have been reported for Butia capitata (Mart.) Becc. pyrenes from
the Cerrado (Soares et al. 2021) and Copernicia prunifera (Mill.)
H.E. Moore seeds from the Brazilian Northeast (Reis et al.
2011), both of which are species associated with flooded environments
and may possess flood-tolerant seedlings (Arruda & Calbo 2004). These
findings suggest that enhanced germination following water immersion may improve
the competitive performance of these species after flooding events in
their natural habitats.
