In 2012, Garcia and Infante published a study examining the
impact of gestures on the mathematical environment during workshops in
higher education settings. Their findings indicated a correlation between the
use of diagramming and both dynamic and static gestures. These
gestures were identified as integral components of students' constructive thinking
processes, particularly in relation to problem-solving and the development of
diagrams. The data suggested that students employed gestures more frequently
when confronted with more challenging problems. Additionally, some students were
influenced by the gestures of their peers, leading to the
adoption and adaptation of these gestures over time.
