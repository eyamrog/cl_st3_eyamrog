In Brazil, politicians at various levels collaborate to achieve both
electoral and governance objectives. Recent scholarship has examined these interactions
using broker theories developed within the field of comparative politics.
This article explores the micro-foundations of alliances between state representatives
and local politicians, assessing the extent to which existing broker
theories are applicable to the Brazilian context. The analysis draws
on survey data from state representatives and interviews with their
advisors, with a focus on the processes by which alliances
are formed, sustained, and dissolved. The findings indicate that mayors
and city councilors serve as significant brokers for state representatives.
Nevertheless, the observation that legislators and local brokers occupy dynamic
positions and often assume dual roles highlights the limitations of
principal-agent theories in fully capturing these relationships. Based on these
results, the article proposes directions for further research on the
dynamics of interest intermediation and the multilevel linkages among political
actors.
