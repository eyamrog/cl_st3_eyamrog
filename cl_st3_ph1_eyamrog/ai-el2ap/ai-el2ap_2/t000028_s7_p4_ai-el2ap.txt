A review of journal platforms for studies addressing the EAL
learning and teaching processes for blind students reveals a notable
lack of discussion on this topic within the field of
Applied Linguistics. This scarcity of research not only highlights a
significant gap in the literature but also poses challenges for
teachers seeking effective adaptation strategies. Consequently, there is a clear
need for research focused on the development and evaluation of
adapted didactic materials for blind students, including the identification of
tangible and audible resources suitable for this population.
