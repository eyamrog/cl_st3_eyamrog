An average score of 9.8 was obtained for the phonetic
criterion during the final evaluation of the upper dentures in
the present study, which differs from the findings of Kawai
et al.13, who reported significantly lower scores for both conventional
and simplified techniques in an evaluation conducted six months after
denture placement. This discrepancy may be explained by the timing
of the evaluations, as the present study assessed patients one
year after denture installation, allowing for a longer adaptation period
compared to the six-month follow-up in Kawai et al.'s study.
Additionally, the extended duration of edentulism experienced by patients in
the current study may have contributed to a greater perceived
improvement in quality of life following treatment, regardless of the
magnitude of the change.
