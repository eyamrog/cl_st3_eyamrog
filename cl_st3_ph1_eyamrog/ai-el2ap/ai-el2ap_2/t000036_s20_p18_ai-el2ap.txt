In contrast, the second group, consisting of salaried workers and
farmers, and the third group, comprising public employees, merchants, exporters,
and agricultural landowners, experienced changes in purchasing power during the
Great Depression that followed the two previously described trends: an
increase in purchasing power until 1932, followed by a continuous
decline until 1939. By 1937, wage levels were only comparable
to those of 1928, indicating that purchasing power did not
increase over the course of the decade. According to Feiker
(1931), Ecuador, with an estimated population of approximately two million
at the time, exhibited a low level of purchasing power,
comparable to that of a Nordic country with a population
of only two hundred thousand.
