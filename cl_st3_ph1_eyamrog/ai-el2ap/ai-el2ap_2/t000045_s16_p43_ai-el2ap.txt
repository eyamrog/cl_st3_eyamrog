All interviewees reported that the legislator maintains a regional office
and/or employs advisors in one or more municipalities relevant to
her constituency. The total number of employees across these offices
is approximately 20, with only a small proportion (between 1
and 4 individuals) assigned to the regional office. In one
instance, nearly half of the staff (9 individuals) were based
in the region and were expected to join a new
office that was in the process of being established. The
primary responsibilities of these regional advisors include identifying local needs,
compensating for the legislatorâ€™s physical absence in the region, conveying
the perspectives and concerns of citizens, and serving as intermediaries
between the regional population and the legislator (Chief of Staff
4).
