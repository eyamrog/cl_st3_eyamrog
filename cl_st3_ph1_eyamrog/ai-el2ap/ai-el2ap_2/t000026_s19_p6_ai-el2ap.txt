Table 4 indicates that, during the data collection period, participants
reported the use of twenty-one distinct medications. Anxiolytic benzodiazepines (specifically
Diazepam and Clonazepam) were the most frequently used, followed by
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants (Escitalopram, Citalopram, and Fluoxetine),
and tricyclic antidepressants (Amitriptyline). These findings identify the medications most
commonly utilized by the survey participants.
