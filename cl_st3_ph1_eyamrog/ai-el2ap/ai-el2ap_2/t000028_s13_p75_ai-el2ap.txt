To facilitate the internalization of greetings vocabulary, students can be
instructed to communicate with each other using the terms introduced
in the song. The teacher may present specific scenarios, such
as those outlined in the textbook (e.g., greeting, parting, and
inquiring about well-being), and allow students to engage in role-play
based on these situations. This approach is intended to promote
both inclusion and interaction among all students, including those who
are blind, while providing a contextualized and engaging learning experience.
Additionally, this activity aims to help students recognize the use
of the target language as a form of social practice,
rather than solely as a set of grammatical rules.
