Data analysis was conducted using content analysis of the interviewees’
statements, following the phases outlined by Campos (2004, p. 614).
These phases include pre-exploration, which involves identifying key aspects of
the material through comprehensive reading; selection of units of analysis
by extracting sentences or transcribing paragraphs relevant to the study’s
objectives; and categorization, defined as the grouping of statements that
encompass a range of themes aligned with the research objectives.
A non-aprioristic approach to categorization was employed, whereby categories were
developed inductively based on the researchers’ engagement with the analyzed
material.
