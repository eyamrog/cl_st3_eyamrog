Our findings have several analytical implications for the study of
mediation dynamics among political actors operating at different levels. They
indicate potential research directions, including the application of innovative network
analysis methods, the utilization of social media data to identify
and examine multilevel alliances, the implementation of longitudinal analyses to
assess factors related to stability and change, and the use
of qualitative research techniques to investigate the mechanisms underlying these
relationships. Additionally, the adoption of comparative (cross-country or subnational) and
multi-method research designs is essential for enhancing the inferential strength
of analyses in this area. It is important to note
that some of the questions addressed in this study are
based on interviews conducted within a single state and with
a specific legislator profile. Employing comparative research designs that incorporate
both quantitative and qualitative evidence would facilitate a more comprehensive
exploration of the research avenues identified in this study.
