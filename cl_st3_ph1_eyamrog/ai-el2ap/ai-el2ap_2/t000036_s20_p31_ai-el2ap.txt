This Pension Fund provided various benefits to workers, including reimbursement
of contributions, income support in cases of disability, work-related accidents,
and occupational illnesses, as well as access to medical assistance.
The retirement system allowed for pension eligibility either at the
age of 75 or after completing 20 years of contributions.
Additionally, if a worker became unemployed or withdrew from the
Fund for any legally recognized reason, their contributions were returned
in full (Instituto Nacional de Previsi√≥n 1939:7).
