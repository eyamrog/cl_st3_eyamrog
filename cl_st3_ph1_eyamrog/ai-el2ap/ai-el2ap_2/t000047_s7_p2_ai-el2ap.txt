The miniaturized elements of micro-linguistics can provide a useful framework
for explaining the concept of mode. In this context, micro-linguistics
refers to the subfields of phonetics/phonology, morphology, grammar/syntax, and semantics.
These areas focus on the analysis of the smallest units
relevant to each domain, such as phones/phonemes in phonetics/phonology, morphemes
in morphology, and lexemes in grammar/syntax. Additionally, semes are recognized
as fundamental components within the field of semiotics.
