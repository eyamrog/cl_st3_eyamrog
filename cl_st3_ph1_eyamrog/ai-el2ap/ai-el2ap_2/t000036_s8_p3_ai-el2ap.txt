Eichengreen and Temin (2000) argue that the Great Depression led
to two distinct effects on the prices of goods and
products in countries adhering to the gold standard. The first
was a deflationary trend resulting from a contraction in the
money supply (Drinot & Knight, 2014). Deflation compelled industries to
lower production costs, either by reducing wages or by decreasing
the workforce (Arnaut, 2010). This deflationary trend ceased when countries
abandoned the gold standard, as was the case in Ecuador
in 1932. Subsequently, an inflationary trend emerged, as the removal
of the gold standard eliminated legal constraints on the issuance
of new currency.
