In routine dental practice, radiographic assessment of the mandibular canal
(MC) is most commonly conducted using periapical, panoramic, and cone-beam
computed tomography (CBCT) images, with reported visibility rates of 28%,
32%, and 98%, respectively [24]. On conventional two-dimensional (2D) radiographs,
the MC is typically visualized as a radiolucent area bordered
by two well-defined radiopaque lines, located inferior to the roots
of the mandibular molars and premolars [25]. This characteristic appearance
results from the principles underlying radiographic line formation, whereby a
radiopaque line is produced when the primary X-ray beam is
perpendicular to the interface between two tissues of differing densities.
In the case of the MC, these density differences are
attributable to the contrast between the trabecular bone and the
inferior neurovascular bundle.
