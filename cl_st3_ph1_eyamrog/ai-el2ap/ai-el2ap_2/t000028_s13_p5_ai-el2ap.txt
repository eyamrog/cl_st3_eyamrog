This section presents an exploratory review of previous studies on
the adaptation of didactic materials for blind students. A search
was conducted across various Applied Linguistics journal websites using keywords
such as “blind,” “blind students,” and “blindness” in both English
and Portuguese; however, no relevant results were identified. These findings
highlight a significant gap in the literature and underscore the
need for research focused on the adaptation of educational materials
for blind students, which is essential for supporting teachers in
the effective inclusion of these students in all didactic activities
within mainstream classrooms.
