the quality of life among rehabilitated Patax√≥ patients indicates that

dentures fabricated using conventional techniques. Notably, dentures provided within a
single day by primary care dentists without specialized training in
prosthetics resulted in measurable improvements in the quality of life
of indigenous patients.
