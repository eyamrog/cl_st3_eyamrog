Our interviews indicate that legislative offices may allocate resources both
to constituents who have previously demonstrated electoral support and to
those who may provide support in future elections. Legislators may
adopt this forward-looking approach when seeking to expand their political
influence into new regions. Although this is not standard practice,
a representative may proactively allocate resources to a locality without
a formal request from the mayor and without securing a
prior commitment of political support. Additionally, chiefs of staff and
other advisors contribute to the cultivation of new alliances by
leveraging their professional and personal networks to connect the representative
with mayors and local political groups.
