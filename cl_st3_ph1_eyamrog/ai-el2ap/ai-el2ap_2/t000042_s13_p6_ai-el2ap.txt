In early August, when Brazil reported three million COVID-19 infections
and 100,000 related deaths, ABRASCO, the Oxfam Brazil Office, and
leaders of the National Health System (SUS) publicly accused the
government of criminal actions and began employing the term "necropolitics."
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the concept of necropolitics had
primarily been applied in studies examining police violence in favelas
and the mass incarceration of Afro-Brazilians in the context of
the "war on drugs." During the pandemic, the Bolsonaro administration
implemented policies that disproportionately affected marginalized populations, effectively compelling low-income
individuals to choose between the risk of hunger due to
isolation and the risk of COVID-19 exposure due to unprotected
work.
