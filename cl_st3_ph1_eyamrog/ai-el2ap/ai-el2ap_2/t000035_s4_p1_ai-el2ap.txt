The Dentures in One Day technique demonstrated feasibility, effectiveness, and
benefits in the rehabilitation of edentulous indigenous populations, contributing to
the reduction of barriers that limit access to comprehensive oral
health care. This approach was associated with improvements in patients'
quality of life and yielded satisfactory outcomes regarding denture quality
and chewing ability as assessed one year after prosthesis placement.
