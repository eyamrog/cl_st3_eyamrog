The primary finding of this study indicates that 58.8% of
health students with high trait anxiety and 60.5% of those
with moderate state anxiety reported using anxiolytic drugs. Furthermore, students
enrolled in public universities demonstrated a higher prevalence of anxiolytic
drug use compared to their counterparts. These results are consistent
with the findings of Marchi et al. (2013), who reported
that 34% of nursing students at a public university exhibited
mild anxiety, and 16% of these students either currently use
or have previously used anxiolytic medication.
