The SIL is a remote area, and the entomological survey
was conducted by multiple teams in coordination with routine operations
carried out by FUNAI. A total of 1,428 sand fly
specimens were identified to either the genus or species level.
Specimens represented ten genera and 33 species, with Trichophoromyia being
the most prevalent genus (57%), followed by Psychodopygus (20%) and
Nyssomyia (5%). The most abundant species were T. ubiquitalis (25%),
T. octavioi (9%), and Ps. davisi (8%).
