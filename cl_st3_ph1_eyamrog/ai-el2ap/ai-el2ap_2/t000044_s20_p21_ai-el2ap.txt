Scherr (2008) extends previous research on gestures in higher education
by investigating whether students' gesticulation not only supplements their verbal
communication but also provides significant insights into their cognitive processes.
Specifically, his study examines how gestures can reveal students' understanding
of physics concepts at a given moment. Scherr (2008) argues
that physics education offers a valuable context for further exploration
of these issues and suggests that researchers in this field
can both benefit from and contribute to ongoing studies on
the role of gesture in thinking and learning.
