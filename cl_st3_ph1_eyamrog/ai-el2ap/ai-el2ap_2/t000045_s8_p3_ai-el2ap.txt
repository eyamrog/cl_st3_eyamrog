To address these research questions, we combined survey data collected
from state representatives in twelve Brazilian states with qualitative evidence
obtained through in-depth interviews with the advisors of these representatives.
This approach enabled us to examine the relationships between state
legislators and local brokers across a diverse set of states
and to identify the micro-foundations and mediation dynamics that characterize
these alliances. Rather than conducting a systematic hypothesis test, this
study adopts an exploratory design aimed at uncovering the mechanisms
underlying interactions between legislators and brokers. The primary contribution of
this research is to propose new theoretical and empirical directions
for the field. Additionally, our study distinguishes itself from existing
literature by focusing on state representatives, rather than federal legislators,
thereby highlighting both the similarities and differences between these two
levels of legislative actors.
