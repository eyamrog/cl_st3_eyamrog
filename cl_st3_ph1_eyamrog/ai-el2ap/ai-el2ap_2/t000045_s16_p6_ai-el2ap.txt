The interviews indicate that mayors (prefeitos), local councilors (vereadores), former
mayors, and former councilors—individuals who currently hold or have previously
held office—are the most significant brokers for state legislators. The
survey data support this finding. When respondents were asked about
the sources of support most relevant to their electoral success,
mayors from the region emerged as the second most important
category in both waves of the state legislator survey. Combining
responses for the first and second most relevant sources of
support, at least 30% of respondents in both survey waves
identified “mayors from their region” as one of the two
most important sources (36.5% in 2007 and 30.3% in 2012).
These findings are consistent with previous research that emphasizes the
role of mayors as key local brokers (Mares and Young,
2016; Gingerich, 2020).
