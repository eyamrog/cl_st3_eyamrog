While Uliana (2013) focuses on tactile resources, Oliveira and Reily
(2014) investigate the use of auditory materials in music education
for blind students. Drawing on Pring and Ockelford (2005), Oliveira
and Reily (2014) state that there is a strong relationship
between the development of language, cognitive, and motor skills and
exposure to environments conducive to musical engagement, which benefits both
sighted and blind students (Oliveira & Reily, 2014, p. 408).
The authors propose various didactic materials for blind students, including
interactive activities designed to increase student engagement, as well as
embossed materials, Braille, voice synthesizers, screen readers, and other assistive
technologies that support learning. Additionally, Oliveira and Reily (2014) emphasize
the significance of encouragement from family, teachers, and the community
in promoting the educational development of blind students.
