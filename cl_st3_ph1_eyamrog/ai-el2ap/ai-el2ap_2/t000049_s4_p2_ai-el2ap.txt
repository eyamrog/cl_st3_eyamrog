The exploratory nature of this research facilitated the identification of
key considerations for planning educational interventions aimed at fostering critical
thinking processes. Specifically, this approach highlights essential questions that require
clarification and can inform both educational and instructional decisions. For
example, it is important to determine which strategies are most
effective in promoting the development of complex scientific attitudes, as
well as which methods best encourage children's verbalization and cooperation
during the investigation of phenomena. Additionally, it is necessary to
identify ways to recognize and prevent routine practices that may
result in automatic responses, where adults either replace or fail
to acknowledge children's contributions.
