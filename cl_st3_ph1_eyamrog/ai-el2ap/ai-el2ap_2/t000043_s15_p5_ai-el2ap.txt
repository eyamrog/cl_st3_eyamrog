In this initial proposal for the assessment tool, studies receiving
3 stars are classified as "poor quality," those receiving up
to 6 stars as "moderate quality," and those receiving 7
to 10 stars as "high quality." This grading system is
intended as a suggested framework for evaluating overall study quality;
however, users of the tool may adapt these criteria as
appropriate to the specific research questions and contexts of the
studies under analysis.
