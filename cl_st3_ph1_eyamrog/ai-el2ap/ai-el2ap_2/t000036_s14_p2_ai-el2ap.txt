Although the methodology employed in this article aligns with approaches
commonly found in Social History and Economic History, the research
is conducted according to the principles of historical objectivity, acknowledging
the inherent limitations of such an approach. This perspective is
consistent with the school of thought associated with Leopold von
Ranke, who emphasized the importance of presenting historical facts as
they occurred, rather than using history to judge the past
or instruct future generations (Iggers 2011:86). Accordingly, the article is
structured to first examine the economic context, followed by an
analysis of the legal system, and finally, a discussion of
issues related to the minimum wage.
