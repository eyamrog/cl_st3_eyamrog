Based on these considerations, the research questions guiding this study
are as follows: How can a blind student learn an
additional language without access to printed didactic activities and adapted
materials in mainstream classrooms? Can visual and printed activities be
adapted using everyday materials? What strategies are available to teachers
to make English as an Additional Language (EAL) printed activities
accessible to blind students? To address these questions, this study
proposes adaptations for didactic activities, drawing on a review of
the literature concerning the teaching and learning processes of blind
students, which is presented following the Methodology section.
