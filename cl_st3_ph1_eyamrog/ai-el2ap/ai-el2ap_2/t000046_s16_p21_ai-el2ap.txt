Health is associated with happiness and well-being, and is often
perceived as feeling comfortable in one’s own body. An ideal
state of health is rarely attainable, particularly among adolescents, whose
bodies are still developing and may fluctuate between being overweight
or underweight. For example, there was a student who expressed
interest in using anabolic steroids to achieve certain physical outcomes.
Adolescents are exposed to various media influences and often pursue
an unattainable ideal of physical perfection. Ultimately, health can be
understood as an individual balance unique to each person (Larissa
