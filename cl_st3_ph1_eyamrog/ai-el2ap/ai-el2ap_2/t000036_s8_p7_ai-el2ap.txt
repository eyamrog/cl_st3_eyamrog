The transformation of farms and the expansion of production within
the large-scale farming sector in several countries necessitate consideration of
an alternative development trajectory, wherein large farms are the primary
agents of production growth. This requirement is further underscored by
the widespread expansion of large-scale agricultural operations, which has occurred
even in countries that have implemented agrarian reforms, including cases
of significant structural change such as those observed in Mexico
and Bolivia (Murmis 1980).
