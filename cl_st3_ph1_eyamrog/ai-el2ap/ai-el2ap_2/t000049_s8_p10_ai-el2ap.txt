The ability and willingness to utilize the body of knowledge
and methodologies used to explain the natural world are essential
for identifying relevant questions and drawing evidence-based conclusions. Technological competence
is defined as the application of this knowledge and methodology
to address identified human needs or wants. Competence in science
and technology also encompasses an understanding of the changes resulting
from human activity and the associated responsibilities of individuals as
citizens (Recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council
on Key Competences for Lifelong Learning, 2006, p. 15).
