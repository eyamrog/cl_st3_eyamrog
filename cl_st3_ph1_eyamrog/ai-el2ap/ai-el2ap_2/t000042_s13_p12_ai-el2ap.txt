Initially, Modi and several Indian authorities characterized COVID-19 as a
universal threat, emphasizing its potential to infect individuals regardless of
religion, race, or nationality. However, public health directives regarding social
distancing, home quarantine, and hand-washing did not adequately consider the
impact of caste-based disparities on access to sanitary housing and
potable water. Effective home quarantine necessitated the availability of a
separate, well-ventilated room for those isolating, yet 17% of Dalit
households lacked adequate ventilation, and nearly 71% of Dalits could
not afford frequent hand-washing with soap. Consequently, pre-existing social inequalities
contributed to varying levels of exposure to the pandemic among
different social groups in India.
