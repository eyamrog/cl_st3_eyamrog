Walkington, Chelule, Woods, and Nathan (2019) argue that gestures are
integral to mathematical reasoning, serving as evidence that mathematical understanding
is embodied and closely associated with action, perception, and the
physical body. During collaborative mathematical discussions, students employ various discourse
practices, including explaining, refuting, and building upon each other's reasoning,
frequently combining speech with gesture to communicate their ideas.
