These data can be utilized to address challenges in the
control of leishmaniases and to enhance understanding of the epidemiology
of this disease. As control measures in Brazil rely on
disease surveillance and monitoring within territorial units that consider biological
and environmental characteristics, our dataset offers valuable contributions to expanding
current knowledge. Specifically, our data include occurrence records from previously
undocumented areas that are typically not surveyed by public health
system control programs for American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) implemented by
the Brazilian government. These records can support the modeling of
both vector and disease distribution across spatial and temporal scales
and help identify priority areas for ACL surveillance and control
efforts.
