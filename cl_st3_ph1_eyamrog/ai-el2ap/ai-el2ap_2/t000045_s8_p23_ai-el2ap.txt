Principal-agent theories have served as a significant framework for analyzing
the relationships between brokers and principals. These theories are widely
utilized in Political Science, particularly in research influenced by rational
choice theory, to explain situations in which one actor—the principal—creates
incentives for another actor—the agent—to make decisions and undertake actions
that align with the principal’s objectives and interests, based on
the assumption of conflicting goals between the two parties (Gailmard,
2012). To reduce agency losses and deter opportunistic behavior or
defection by brokers, principals employ a range of mechanisms, including
the allocation of rewards and punishments such as promises of
career advancement, appointments to public sector positions, support for local
allies in candidate recruitment, and the provision of financial resources
during elections, among other private benefits (Camp, 2015; Novaes, 2018).
