The discourse surrounding Putin’s war is reiterated in this context.
Scholz’s stated objective is to differentiate the will of the
Russian people, presumed to be consistent with Western democratic values,
from that of the Russian president, thereby isolating him. At
a more implicit level, this approach simplifies the conflict by
framing it in binary terms of good versus evil, preemptively
countering more nuanced perspectives that might historically justify Russia’s actions.
The discourse is conveyed through a combination of affective language
(e.g., “verzweifelten Lage” [‘desperate situation’]) and evaluative judgement, as Scholz
claims that Ukrainians are not only defending their homeland but
are also fighting for “Freiheit und ihre Demokratie, für Werte,
die wir mit ihnen teilen” [‘freedom and democracy, for values
that we share with them’], thereby positioning them as both
democrats and Europeans. By supporting Ukraine, Scholz asserts that “we”
are “auf der richtigen Seite der Geschichte” [‘on the right
side of history’], a phrase that references Germany’s historical experience
and its previous alignment with morally condemned actions. Consequently, the
policy shift regarding arms deliveries is presented as both morally
justified and historically necessary, explicitly contrasted with the perceived immorality
of “Putins Aggression” [‘Putin’s aggression’].
