The use of gestures in second language instruction can enhance
the presentation of new vocabulary, influence assessment practices, and facilitate
stronger connections between gestures and target words. In the context
of inclusive education, gestures may offer additional opportunities for research
and serve as a valuable resource to support both teachers
and students with disabilities or learning disorders. Furthermore, in science
and mathematics education, gestures function as a tool to aid
in the instruction of concepts that are typically regarded as
abstract and complex.
