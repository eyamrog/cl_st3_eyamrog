In this floristic survey, herbs represent the predominant growth form,
accounting for 108 species, which contrasts with findings from other
plant surveys (Silva et al. 2015, Gadelha-Neto et al. 2018)
where woody plants are more prevalent. Several factors may explain
the predominance of herbs in this study, including environmental conditions
that may favor herbaceous species or a potential underrepresentation of
herbaceous taxa in previous studies due to limited collection efforts
targeting this stratum in similar environments.
