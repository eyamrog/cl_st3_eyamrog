Utterances are influenced both by previous uses of specific discourses
and by anticipated future uses (Voloshinov, 1973 [1929], p. 86),
such that all discourse engages in dialogue with prior discourses
on the same subject as well as with potential future
discourses, whose responses it predicts and accommodates (Todorov, 1984, p.
x). Discourses that pertain to the anticipation of a response
are referred to as the not-yet-spoken, while those comprising previous
utterances on the topic are termed the already-spoken (Morson &
Emerson, 1990, p. 137). In this context, discourse is defined
as “a system of meaning—a set of propositions that cohere
around a given object of meaning” (Baxter, 2011, p. 2).
Within any utterance, discourses are considered to be in competition
when the meanings they promote are mutually negating in some
respect (Baxter, 2011, p. 2).
