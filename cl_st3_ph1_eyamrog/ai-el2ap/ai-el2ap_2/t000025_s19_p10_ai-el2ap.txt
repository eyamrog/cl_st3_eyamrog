Ten studies (14.2%) investigated the use of absorbent dressings for
managing pain associated with malignant fungating wounds (MFWs). The study
designs included non-systematic reviews (50%), case studies (20%), a guideline
(10%), a randomized clinical trial (10%), and a survey (10%).
The majority of these studies (90%) did not specifically aim
to evaluate the effectiveness of absorbent dressings for MFW-related pain
control. Instead, some studies referenced absorbent dressings as an option
for patients experiencing pain due to high exudate levels, with
the intention of reducing pain associated with periwound moisture and
potential dermatitis. In all cases, absorbent dressings were used in
conjunction with other therapies, such as opioids, anesthetics, and antiseptics.
None of the studies described a standardized protocol for the
use of absorbent dressings or reported outcomes related to pain
management when these dressings were used as a sole intervention.
