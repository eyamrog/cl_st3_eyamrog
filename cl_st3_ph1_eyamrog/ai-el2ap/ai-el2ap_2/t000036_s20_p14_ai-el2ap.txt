In the third group, which consists of the economically active
population employed in the public sector, industry, and commerce, data
from Naranjo (2017) indicate that the lowest-paid employees and workers
earned an average monthly income of 91 sucres during the
1920s. However, these wages declined significantly during the international economic
crisis; specifically, the Great Depression led to a reduction in
unskilled wages by approximately 25 sucres between 1929 and 1935.
As anticipated, this group, due to its direct involvement in
the local market and national trade, received higher remuneration compared
to the other groups.
