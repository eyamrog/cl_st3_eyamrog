Our findings challenge the notion that friendship and reciprocity are
insignificant in the relationships between legislators and local brokers. Data
from the 2007 and 2012 survey waves indicate that legislators
did not attribute their ability to secure the support of
mayors and councilors to a single predominant factor. Instead, personal
and family relationships were frequently cited as the main factor
(25.6% in 2007 and 32.4% in 2012), alongside the implementation
of public works in the locality (26.7% in 2007), channeling
resources to the region (15.3% in 2012), party relations (14%
in 2007 and 21% in 2012), and supporting the campaigns
of mayors and councilors (11.6% in 2007 and 15.3% in
2012). These results suggest that, contrary to the emphasis in
recent literature on party relations, the factors influencing these relationships
are more varied.
