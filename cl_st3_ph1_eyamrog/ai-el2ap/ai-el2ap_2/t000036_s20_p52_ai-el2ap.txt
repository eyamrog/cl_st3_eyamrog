The Constitution approved on November 10, 1937, established that Brazil
recognized the necessity of a "minimum wage capable of satisfying,
according to each region, the normal needs of work" (Owen
1938:326). To implement this provision, several commissions were formed to
determine minimum wage levels based on geographic divisions. The resulting
differentiated wage rates were subsequently authorized through an executive decree.
