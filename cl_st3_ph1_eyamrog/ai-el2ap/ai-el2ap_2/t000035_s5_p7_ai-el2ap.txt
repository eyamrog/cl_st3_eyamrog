Most patients reported that eating difficulties were primarily due to
tooth loss. After one year, high scores were recorded for
the ability to chew food, with a median value of
10 for all foods except coconut flesh, which had a
lower mean score of 7.2. Coconut flesh, characterized by its
firm texture, has previously been identified as difficult to chew
among denture users. All foods assessed are commonly consumed by
indigenous populations and are also present in the diets of
urban residents. These findings are consistent with previous research demonstrating
improved self-assessment of chewing function following the provision of new
dentures.
