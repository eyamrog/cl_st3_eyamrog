Municipal and general (state and national) elections in Brazil are
held alternately every two years. In municipal elections, mayors and
councilors are elected in 5,568 municipalities, while in the subsequent
general elections, state and national legislators, senators, governors, and the
president of the Republic are chosen. Executive positions at all
levels are filled through a majoritarian electoral system, whereas legislators
and councilors are elected using an open-list proportional representation system.
In state and national elections, with the exception of the
presidential race, the electoral districts correspond to the twenty-seven federation
units. Consequently, even national representatives are elected within their respective
states, and their electoral campaigns are organized at the state
level.
