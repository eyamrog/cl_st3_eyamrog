A total of 20 proposals for the topical management of
malignant fungating wound (MFW)-related pain were identified. These proposals are
organized into two main categories: topical therapies applied directly to
the wound and topical therapies applied to the periwound skin.
Figure 2 presents the distribution of topical therapies across the
70 included studies. Figure 3 provides an overview of the
identified topical therapies, categorized by the sources of MFW-related pain,
and highlights the primary research gaps in this area.
