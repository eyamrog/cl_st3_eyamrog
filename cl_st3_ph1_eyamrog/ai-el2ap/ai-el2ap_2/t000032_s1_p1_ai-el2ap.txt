Athletes' mood states may fluctuate according to match contexts. This
study examines variations in present mood states over time among
18 male youth soccer players (Mage = 15.4 Â± 0.266
years) during a competitive season. The Present Mood States List
(PMSL) was administered to assess mood states 40 minutes prior
to each event, which included both training sessions and matches.
For each event, the presence values of each PMSL factor
were calculated for each player. Distinct patterns of mood state
changes were identified over time. Additionally, the pattern of change
in certain mood states varied depending on the event's relation
to specific matches. These findings highlight the significance of considering
the temporal dynamics as an influential variable in the assessment
of changes in athletes' mood states.
