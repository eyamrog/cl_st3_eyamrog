The cards may be utilized by blind students as supplementary
materials or as part of an educational activity in which
the teacher shuffles the cards and the student arranges them
to match the corresponding word and numeral. In this way,
the activity supports not only the development of speaking and
listening skills but also reinforces the recognition of the written
forms of the words.
