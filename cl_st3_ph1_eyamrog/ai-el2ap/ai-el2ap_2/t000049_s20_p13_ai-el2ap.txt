The data presented in Tables 3, 4, and 5 indicate
that groups A (promotion from within) and B (promotion from
within and subsequent discussion) differ from group C (no intervention
to promote scientific attitude), particularly in the categories of experimentation
(A=6, B=10, C=1) and problem detection (A=10, B=5, C=0). In
contrast, differences among the groups are minimal in the categories
of phenomenon detection and exploration. These findings suggest that while
providing children with stimulating materials and opportunities for free exploration
is important, such measures alone are insufficient to foster more
complex scientific behaviors. Notably, the more advanced scientific attitudes associated
with Dewey’s inquiry process were observed primarily in groups that
received both access to materials and adult support, with interventions
grounded in Bruner’s (1967) tutoring framework and Vygotsky’s (1934; 1938)
concept of the zone of proximal development. These adult-led interventions
were designed not only to encourage the emergence of scientific
attitudes but also to support their development and enrichment by
facilitating learning processes.
