Patterns of change in present mood states, as represented by
PMSL Factors II (Fatigue), VII (Interest), and XII (Serenity), were
observed across different events (TR-PRE, MATCH, and TR-POST), indicating that
these temporal patterns of mood state changes are recurrent over
time. Specifically, the presence of Factor VII (Interest) increased as
the match approached, while the presence of Factor II (Fatigue)
decreased correspondingly. Torres-Luque et al. (2013) also reported a decrease
in the Fatigue Factor of the POMS prior to competition,
followed by an increase after the event, which aligns with
expectations following physical and mental exertion during training sessions and
matches. Similarly, Nogueira (2009) found that youth soccer players reported
high levels of fatigue, as indicated by the statement “I
am tired,” which has the highest loading on Factor II
(Fatigue), immediately after matches regardless of the outcome. In the
present study, although assessments were conducted 48 hours post-match (TR-POST),
elevated levels of Factor II (Fatigue) persisted after competition. Russell
et al. (2019) noted inconsistencies in the literature regarding mental
fatigue in sports, particularly concerning its impact on performance, and
emphasized the need to improve the ecological validity of research
in this area. They suggested that one way to address
this issue is to examine the effects of mental fatigue
on performance over the course of a season.
