From the outset, researchers encountered a complex environmental and intercultural
context in which the mere intensification of standard health service
measures was insufficient and, at times, incompatible with the health
principles and concepts of the indigenous group. Limited access to
villages hindered the mapping and documentation of potential transmission sites.
Additionally, the long incubation period of ACL, the intricate mobility
patterns of the Wajãpi within their territory, and constraints within
the health services—including insufficiently trained personnel, inadequate funding, and limited
infrastructure—rendered the identification of transmission foci, as recommended by Ministry
of Health surveillance protocols focused on individual risk factors, largely
ineffective.
