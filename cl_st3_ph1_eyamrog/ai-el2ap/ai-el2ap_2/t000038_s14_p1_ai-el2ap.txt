Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed to empirically determine the
factor structure of the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) (Qiu
et al., 2020). The analysis utilized the FACTOR software, which
supports various procedures relevant to EFA, including the determination of
the number of factors or components to retain, the application
of both factor and component analysis, and the implementation of
different rotation methods (Lorenzo-Seva and Ferrando, 2013). As an initial
step, the SOLOMON procedure was applied to divide the sample
into subsamples in order to evaluate whether both subsamples exhibited
a comparable amount of common variance (Lorenzo-Seva, 2021).
