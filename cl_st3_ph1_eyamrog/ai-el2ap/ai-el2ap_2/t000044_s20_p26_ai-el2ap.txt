Özçalışkan, Adamson, Dimitrova, and Baumann (2018) found that both children
and parents produced similar types of gestures and gesture-speech combinations.
In their study of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD),
Down syndrome (DS), and typical development (TD), they identified diagnosis-specific
differences in gesture production among the children. However, only the
children, and not the parents, demonstrated diagnosis-related variability in the
frequency of producing each type of gesture and gesture-speech combination.
