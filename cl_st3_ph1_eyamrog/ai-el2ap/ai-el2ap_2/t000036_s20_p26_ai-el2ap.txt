Law of Civil Responsibility for Labor Compensation: In addition to
the eviction law, which established the requirements for compensation and
evictions, the Law of Civil Responsibility for Labor Compensation was
enacted. This legislation linked the provision of compensation to the
severity of cases resulting from work-related accidents (Albornoz 1931).
