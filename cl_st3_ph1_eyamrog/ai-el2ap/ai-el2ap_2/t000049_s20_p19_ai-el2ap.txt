Certain meetings can be characterized by the presence of data
that deviate from the general trend observed within a group.
In groups A and B, specific meetings display data that
indicate the emergence of particular situations. For instance, in group
B, there was a marked decrease in the use of
verbal communication methods, the social dimension, and the percentage of
time allocated to scientific conduct during the second meeting. Conversely,
the fourth meeting in group B was notable for a
substantially high percentage of time devoted to scientific activities (87%),
a phenomenon that will be further examined in relation to
the adult's role. In group A, more complex scientific behaviors
were observed beginning with the second meeting (see section 4.2).
In contrast, such developments were not evident in group C,
where the children did not appear to engage in more
complex epistemic behaviors, advanced verbal communication modalities, or increased collaborative
social interactions.
