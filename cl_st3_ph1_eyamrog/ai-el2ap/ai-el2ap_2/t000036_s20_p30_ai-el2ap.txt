For peasants and segments of the indigenous population living under
the huasipungo system, the structure of the labor arrangement did
not reflect their actual living conditions. Many individuals within this
group were effectively landless and homeless, lacking personal property, and
were often bound to labor contracts for life in exchange
for minimal compensation, with debts that were rarely, if ever,
settled (Albornoz 1931:47). Adaptation to this labor system occurred gradually
over subsequent decades, coinciding with improvements in the national economy
and the expansion and proliferation of companies. In 1928, Ecuador
established social security as a state-regulated system, originating from the
Pension Fund, which primarily provided retirement, civil, and mortuary benefits
to civil and military officials (Instituto Nacional de Previsi√≥n 1939:5).
