The consideration of inanimate objects as modal devices encompasses a
range of complexities due to their inherent natural and scientific
associations. Each mode within this category is supported by specific
theoretical frameworks (Heitzmann, 1998; Howells, 2003; O’Toole, 2011; Ravelli &
McMurtrie, 2016; Bateman, Wildfeuer & Hiippala, 2017; Forceville, 2020). Consequently,
the selection of modes for analysis determines the relevant conceptual
frameworks to be employed. No single dataset can accommodate all
theoretical perspectives within the theory of modes (Modics), indicating a
conceptual division of labor in the study of multimodality. Color
and music represent recent additions to the range of modes,
with van Leeuwen’s parametric and rhythmic principles (2010, 2011, 2014,
2016) providing significant analytical approaches for these modalities. All elements
listed in Figure 1 are classified as modes because they
meet the criteria established by scientific analysis for generating substantial
meaning potential. The diverse manifestations of modes in human society
underscore the complexity and scope of multimodality as a field
of study. This reflects the prevailing academic framework for understanding
meaning production in dialogue, interaction, conversation, and communication more broadly.
