Modi paid limited attention to existing social disparities and the
potential for stigmatization when implementing social distancing and quarantine measures.
In the second half of March 2020, after the virus
had spread to thirteen of the twenty-eight states, Modi announced
a nationwide lockdown modeled after those in Europe. The government
mandated home quarantine for all incoming international travelers, instituted a
three-week national lockdown, and suspended all inter-state train and bus
services. The announcement received positive attention internationally. It is notable
that the "lives versus livelihoods" debate was less prominent in
India than in Brazil. Nevertheless, the implementation of the lockdown
in India faced several challenges: it was announced abruptly, prepared
with limited planning, involved minimal testing, provided inadequate temporary shelters
for migrant workers, and recommended hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a prophylactic
for healthcare workers. Additionally, longstanding tensions between state and central
government authorities during epidemics were exacerbated, leading to accusations that
Modi was exercising authoritarian control.
