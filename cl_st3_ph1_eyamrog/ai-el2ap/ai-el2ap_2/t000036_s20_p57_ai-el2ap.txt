The Superior Labor Council initiated discussions on a proposed minimum
wage bill, which was approved in March 1935 for submission
to the national congress. The bill stipulated that the minimum
daily wage should be set at no less than two-thirds
and no more than three-fourths of the prevailing or standard
wage in each region of the country.
