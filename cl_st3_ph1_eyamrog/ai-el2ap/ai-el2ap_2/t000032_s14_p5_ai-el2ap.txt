Statistical analysis was conducted using the Event Series value, defined
as the mean presence of PMSL factors in TR-PRE, MATCH,
and TR-POST for the same championship round. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
indicated that the data were normally distributed (p = 0.068).
Comparisons were performed using a multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA)
with repeated measures in a mixed-model design. When significant differences
were identified, the Bonferroni post hoc test was applied. The
significance level was set at p â‰¤ .05, and all
calculations were performed using SPSS version 20.0 for Windows.
