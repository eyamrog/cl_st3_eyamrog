Scientific education is defined as the promotion of critical and
reflective thinking, with an emphasis on developing knowledge related to
living organisms and the natural environment. These competencies are fostered
within the subject through an inquiry-based process, which, according to
Dewey, involves identifying and examining relevant issues. This process requires
systematic observation, the formulation of hypotheses, the proposal of solutions,
and the subsequent verification of these solutions.
