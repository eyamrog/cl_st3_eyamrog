Originally developed in 1995 for the evaluation of vaccine safety
in pharmacoepidemiology, this study design is now applied in general
epidemiology as well (1,6,7). It is a derivative of the
cohort study design, in which individuals who have experienced the
event of interest are observed over a predefined observation period,
and both their exposure history and the occurrence of the
event are recorded. Within the observation period, distinct risk and
control periods are established, which typically differ in duration. The
risk period is defined a priori as the interval during
or following exposure when individuals are presumed to be at
an altered risk (either increased or decreased) for the event
of interest. The control period encompasses any time within the
observation period that does not overlap with the risk period,
and may occur before, after, or between risk periods (1,2,8).
For instance, in a study assessing the risk of Guillain-Barr√©
Syndrome (GBS) following Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in England, the
risk period was defined as the interval from the day
of vaccination (day 0) to day 91, while the control
period included all other times outside the risk period (9).
