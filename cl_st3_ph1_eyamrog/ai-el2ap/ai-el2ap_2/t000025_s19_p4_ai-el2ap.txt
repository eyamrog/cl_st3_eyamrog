Of the studies reviewed, 32 (45.7%) were non-systematic literature reviews,
20 (28.5%) were case studies, and 18 (25.8%) employed other
methodologies, including controlled trials, systematic reviews, cohort studies, guidelines, and
surveys, as detailed in Table 4. Only seven studies on
malignant fungating wounds (MFW) (10%) identified pain management as a
primary outcome. Sample sizes across the studies ranged from 1
to 60 patients.
