The question of whether gestures facilitate student learning beyond merely
directing visual attention has been investigated by Wakefield et al.
(2019), who employed eye-tracking technology to examine the commonly proposed
mechanism of gesture-guided attention. Drawing on prior research by Singer
and Goldin-Meadow (2005), which demonstrated that new concepts can be
taught through gestures accompanying speech, Wakefield et al. assessed how
gestures influence students' allocation of visual attention during instruction. Their
findings indicate that children who participated in math lessons incorporating
gestures distributed their visual attention differently compared to those in
lessons without gestures: they spent more time analyzing the problem
being explained, less time looking at the instructor, and were
more likely to synchronize their visual attention with the information
conveyed in the instructorâ€™s speech.
