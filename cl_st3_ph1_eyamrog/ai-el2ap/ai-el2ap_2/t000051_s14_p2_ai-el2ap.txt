The analysis consists of two steps. In the first step,
I identify both already-articulated and not-yet-articulated discourses within the speech
using thematic analysis. These discourses may be either manifest, meaning
they are explicitly stated, or latent, meaning they are implicit
and function as unspoken presuppositions or assumptions that are taken
for granted (Baxter, 2011, pp. 158â€“159). Latent discourses can be
identified by considering what background knowledge a listener requires to
interpret a given textual segment, specifically which sociocultural and interpersonal
discourses must be invoked to understand its meaning (Baxter, 2011,
p. 159). To facilitate this process, I draw on the
resources of attitude from Appraisal Theory (Martin & White, 2005,
p. 42), as these can reveal what is considered typical
or normative; as noted by Baxter (2011, p. 160), judgments
made in discourse are often grounded in implicit discursive systems
of meaning. Both already-articulated and not-yet-articulated discourses can be classified
as proximal or distal: proximal discourses are produced by directly
involved parties, whereas distal discourses are those circulating more broadly
within the culture and are articulated by individuals other than
the immediate participants (Baxter, 2011, p. 53).
