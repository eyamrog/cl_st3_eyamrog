Encouraging students to use gestures while explaining a problem may
provide additional insight into their understanding of the problem's development,
which may not be fully apparent in their verbal explanations.
The gestures produced by students can serve as diagnostic tools
for teachers, enabling them to assess students' current knowledge and
to identify concepts for which students are prepared to learn
next.
