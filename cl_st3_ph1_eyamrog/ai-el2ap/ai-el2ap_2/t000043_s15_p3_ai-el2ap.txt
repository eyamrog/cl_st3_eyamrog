The proposed quality assessment tool is organized into three sections:
Selection, Comparability, and Outcomes, as presented in Table 1. In
the Selection section, the tool assesses the representativeness of the
selected cases in the SCCS/SCRI relative to the total cases
from the study population, the clarity of case definitions, the
method of exposure ascertainment, and the absence of the outcome
of interest at the beginning of the observation period. The
Comparability section evaluates the consideration of time-varying confounding factors, such
as age and seasonality, and requires that studies report whether
these factors were addressed and if any adjustments were made
in the analysis. The Outcomes section examines the methods used
to ascertain the outcome of interest, the explicit identification of
risk and control periods, and the adequacy of the observation
periods.
