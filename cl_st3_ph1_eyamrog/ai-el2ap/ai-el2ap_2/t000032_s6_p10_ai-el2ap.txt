In the present study, analysis of Present Mood States indicated
significant differences in their presence values across the time sequence
of the competition, suggesting that the use of an instrument
such as the PMSL, which was developed in Brazil for
the Brazilian population, may be more suitable for investigating these
aspects. The PMSL includes a broader range of positive and
negative mood states compared to instruments like the POMS, thereby
expanding the potential for examining relationships with other variables in
the sports context that are associated with changes in athletes’
Present Mood States. The PMSL is also characterized by its
rapid applicability and has been used to assess concordance with
other instruments such as the PANAS (Pires et al., 2013).
The findings are consistent with those reported in previous studies
utilizing the PMSL (Bueno and Di Bonifácio, 2007; Dias-Silva, 2013;
Di Bonifácio, 2013; Nogueira, 2009; Silva, 2013). The presence of
Factors III (Hope) and VII (Interest), as well as the
item “I am happy” (which is negatively correlated with Factor
I - Humiliation/Anger, thereby reducing the presence value of this
factor), indicates that these mood states are commonly observed among
Soccer, Football, Volleyball, and Futsal athletes prior to matches.
