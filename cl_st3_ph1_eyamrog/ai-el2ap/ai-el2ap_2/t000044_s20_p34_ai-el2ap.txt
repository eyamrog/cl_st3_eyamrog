The primary function of gestures is to facilitate communication; however,
gestures also play a significant role in cognitive processes such
as thinking, learning, and language comprehension. Beyond merely clarifying or
enhancing the content of a message, gestures can contribute to
students' understanding and support conceptual development, which constitutes the main
focus of this research (Chu & Kita, 2016).
