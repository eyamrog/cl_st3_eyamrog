Renealmia petasites closely resembles R. chrysotricha Petersen, with only minor
morphological differences distinguishing the two species. R. petasites is characterized
by a wider leaf blade (4–13 cm), a shorter calyx
(1–2 cm), a larger pedicel (0.5–1.5 cm), a white labellum
that is slightly pink, and approximately 50 seeds per fruit.
In contrast, R. chrysotricha has a narrower leaf blade (4.5–9.5
cm), a longer calyx (1.8–2.5 cm), a smaller pedicel (0.2–0.6
cm), a completely white labellum, and up to 25 seeds
per fruit (Maas 1977; Lima et al. 2018).
