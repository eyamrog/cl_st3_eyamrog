In the second group, which comprises salaried workers and farmers,
available information is limited and primarily derived from sources in
the central region of the country. Salary data from 1936
indicate that baker's assistants earned between 2 and 5 sucres
per day (see Figure 1), amounting to approximately 40 to
100 sucres per month, with the potential for an additional
4 to 10 sucres if weekend work is included. Employment
on large cattle ranches was comparatively better compensated, with monthly
wages around 75 sucres in 1936. Furthermore, account book records
(see Figure 2) indicate that workers also received supplementary payments
in the form of goods, such as cattle, beef, sheep,
potatoes, and corn.
