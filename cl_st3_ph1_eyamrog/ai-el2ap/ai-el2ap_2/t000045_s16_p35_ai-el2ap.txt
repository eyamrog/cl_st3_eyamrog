In the political sphere, there is a perception of comprehensive
knowledge regarding individualsâ€™ qualifications, levels of dedication, and work performance.

for office. Consequently, political activities and responsibilities continue beyond the
electoral process, necessitating sustained and serious work immediately following the
election (Chief of Staff 9).
