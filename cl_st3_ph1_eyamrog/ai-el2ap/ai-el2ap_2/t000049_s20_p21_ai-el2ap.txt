The analysis of the strategies employed by the adult indicates
that many interventions align with the ‘promotion from within’ approach
utilized by groups A and B, particularly through the use
of mirroring. In these two groups, the adult’s primary objective
was to encourage further exploration, extend the activity, or prompt
reflection on the experience (A=35 and B=36 interventions). In contrast,
group C exhibited a higher frequency of interventions aimed at
maintaining the effectiveness of social dynamics (C=13 interventions). In this
group, the adult facilitated social functioning either by adopting accommodating
strategies, such as agreeing to participate in play to help
establish rules, or by providing more explicit instructions (e.g., “Let’s
take your kit and see what’s inside. Is there anything
interesting? Let’s try to separate the floating objects from the
sinking ones.”).
