Kane et al. evaluated the bucco-lingual position of the mandibular
canal (MC) in 20 patients using computed tomography (CT) and
reported that the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) and its accompanying
vessels are located approximately 4.7 mm from the buccal aspect
and 1.8 mm from the lingual aspect of the mandible
at the level of the mandibular first molar [9].
