Efforts to monitor the behavior of local brokers involve systematic
procedures, such as maintaining spreadsheets that record information about the
brokers, the number of votes they have delivered, and projections
for the next election. With one exception, all legislators’ offices
maintained some form of this spreadsheet. This practice is consistent
with the argument that politicians use electoral cycles to assess
brokers’ performance (Gingerich, 2020). However, interviews also indicated the existence
of more informal monitoring methods, which focus on collecting information
about the broker’s activities and efforts, while considering the scope
of what the broker is realistically able to achieve.
