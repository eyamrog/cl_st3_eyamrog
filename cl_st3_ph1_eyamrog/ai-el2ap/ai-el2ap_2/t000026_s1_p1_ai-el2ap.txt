This study analyzed the correlation between anxiety levels and the
use of anxiolytic medications among university students in health-related fields.
A nationwide online survey was administered to 286 students, of
whom 77.9% were female, with a mean age of 23.3
years (SD = 4.9). The results indicated that 39.86% of
participants reported using anxiolytic medication, with the majority being senior
students (87.9%). Anxiolytic use was observed in 58.8% of students
with high trait anxiety and in 60.5% of those with
moderate state anxiety. There was a statistically significant association between
anxiolytic use and university type, as well as a weak
negative correlation between age and trait anxiety. These findings suggest
that universities should implement targeted strategies for anxiety management and
incorporate interventions aimed at reducing anxiety symptoms within their student
support programs.
