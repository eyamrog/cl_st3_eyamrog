This article applies Bakhtinian dialogism and the concept of centripetal-centrifugal
struggle within critical discourse studies to examine how dominant and
marginalised discourses compete in political language to justify paradigm shifts.
The analysis focuses on German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Zeitenwende (‘watershed’)
speech, delivered in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine,
in which he announced a significant armament programme and a
major change in foreign policy—an unprecedented shift in German politics.
Using a qualitative approach informed by Appraisal Theory, specifically the
Attitude and Engagement frameworks, the study identifies how Scholz aligns
with certain dominant discourses while marginalising others, constructing an existential
threat to Germany that frames his armament policies as necessary
and unavoidable. The findings demonstrate the analytical value of examining
dialogically contractive and expansive strategies in critical discourse studies.
