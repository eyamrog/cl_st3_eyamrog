This study examines the modal constructs present in a commercial
advertisement for Oral-BÂ® Toothpaste, with the aim of explaining the
mechanistic integration of various modes to generate holistic meaning. By
applying the mood system and concepts from kinesics, the analysis
interprets the video content for readers. In addition to utilizing
statistical data, such as tables and graphs, to explore the
modes, the study identifies fragmentation in the structures of certain
linguistic items, including "The answer?", "Easy," and "still fresh and
strong." The analysis also notes the use of repetition, particularly
with the generic terms "You," "your teeth," and "your mouth,"
which serve to emphasize key points. Communicative devices such as
"strong and healthy" and "long lasting fresh breath (feeling)" are
highlighted as exemplifying the dual 2-IN-1 qualities of the product.
Gestural modes, such as smiling, are observed in repeated verbal
cues like "Smile, Smile, Smile," and the use of intimate
and personal distances further augments meaning, with Social Actors 1
and 2 functioning as indexical participants. The advertisement employs professional
actors and emphasizes the dual 2-IN-1 features to convey interchangeability.
While the advertisement is engaging, the metaphor of interchangeability could
be simplified to enhance comprehension among audiences with lower literacy
levels.
