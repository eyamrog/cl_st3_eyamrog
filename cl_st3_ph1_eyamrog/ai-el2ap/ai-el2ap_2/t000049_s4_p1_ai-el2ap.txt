The comprehensive collection and subsequent quantitative and qualitative analysis of
materials during the research yielded essential data for identifying the
parameters of an educational approach that fosters a context conducive
to the development of scientific attitudes. In this context, scientific
attitudes are defined as engagement in active investigation that promotes
autonomous and participatory knowledge construction, as well as scientific understanding
(Andersson & Gullberg, 2014; Onida & Salvadori, 2020). Furthermore, the
analysis provided insights into strategies for supporting the development of
science-oriented behaviors, which facilitate critical reflection on issues and enhance
understanding of the complexities, interconnections, and relationships that characterize the
world (Arc√† & Mazzoli, 1995; Bertolino, Guerra, Schenetti, & Antonacci,
2017).
