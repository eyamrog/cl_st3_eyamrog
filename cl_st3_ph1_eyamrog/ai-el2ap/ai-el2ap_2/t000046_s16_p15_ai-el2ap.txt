As there are physicians in my household, health has been
prioritized from an early age with my children. For example,
my husband insisted that the pacifier always be kept in
the refrigerator for hygiene reasons. Health serves as the foundation
for our household routines and decisions. Recently, I received a
vaccine, influenced by my husbandâ€™s emphasis on the importance of
vaccination, a perspective consistently reinforced in our family, as both
my husband and two children are physicians. At 60 years
old, I consider my health to be good, and I
have no significant health problems. I strive to convey the
importance of maintaining health to my students, emphasizing proper diet
and regular physical exercise. I practiced classical ballet for ten
years and operated a dance academy, which provided significant physical
activity. I believe that dance, as an art form, is
an important component of physical education and should remain a
permanent part of the school curriculum.
