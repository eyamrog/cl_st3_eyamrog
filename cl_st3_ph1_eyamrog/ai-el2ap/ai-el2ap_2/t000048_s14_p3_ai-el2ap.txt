From its inception, one of the primary objectives was the
preservation of springs and water sources in the metropolitan region
of São Paulo, specifically through the Capivari and Embu Guaçu
rivers, as well as in Itanhaém via the Mambu/Rio Branco
system. With respect to ecosystem services, the Núcleo contributes in
several areas, including the regulation of air and climate quality,
the protection of hills, slopes, and soils, and the preservation
of biodiversity, among other functions (PESM 2021a, b).
