In the north-central Sierra region, which comprises the provinces of
Chimborazo, Tungurahua, Cotopaxi, Pichincha, and Imbabura, the hacienda system served
as the foundation for both textile and agricultural production, constituting
the primary source of income for workers and facilitating industrial
development. According to Creamer (2018), a textile boom emerged in
the 1920s, establishing the groundwork for subsequent industrial growth in
the region. Notable examples of this development include the haciendas
in Otavalo and the Valley of Los Chillos (Saint-Geours, 1994).
