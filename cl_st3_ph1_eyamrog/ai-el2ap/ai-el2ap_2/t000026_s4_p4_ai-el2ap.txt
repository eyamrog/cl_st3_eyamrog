This study has several limitations that should be considered. First,
its cross-sectional design precludes the establishment of causal relationships. Second,
the small sample size may limit the generalizability of the
findings. Nevertheless, the data obtained may still provide a basis
for future longitudinal research. Additionally, the use of a self-administered
questionnaire introduces the potential for recall bias and variability in
participants' interpretation of the questions. Finally, the sample is not
fully representative of all types of higher education institutions, as
public and community universities are underrepresented.
