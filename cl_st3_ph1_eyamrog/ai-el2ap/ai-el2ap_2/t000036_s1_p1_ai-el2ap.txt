This article analyzes the labor context in Ecuador during the
1930s with the objective of providing new quantitative, legal, and
contextual data. These data are significant as they contribute three
key elements to the understanding of the labor environment: the
economically active population and their purchasing power; the legal framework
governing labor conditions; and a concise overview of minimum wage
implementation. The analysis employs a historical-comparative and analytical methodology, focusing
on three groups of workers: those in the public and
industrial sectors; those in the interior and small industry; and
those in rural sectors. The findings indicate that the first
group benefited from multiple legal protections, including compensation for eviction,
premature separation, maternity, disability, and overtime, as well as a
minimum wage differentiated by region and type of work. In
contrast, the second group experienced inconsistent legal benefits, with minimum
wages typically paid as daily wages and often provided in
kind. The third group lacked legal protections entirely, as their
distinct cultural conditions excluded them from formal labor regulations, and
their compensation was generally provided in kind or through food
exchange.
