The dataset consists of sand fly records collected as part
of a project designed to evaluate the primary risk factors
for leishmaniasis using an interdisciplinary approach. In 2012, an outbreak
of leishmaniasis occurred in the WIL, affecting more than 20
individuals across seven villages [17]. This event prompted a comprehensive
investigation conducted from 2012 to 2015 to elucidate the causal
processes within the local epidemiological context and to develop strategies
for disease prevention and control among the Wajãpi population. The
investigation was carried out through a multi-institutional collaboration involving health-related
organizations, including the Distrito Sanitário Especial Indígena (DSEI) Amapá e
Norte do Pará, Secretaria Municipal de Saúde de Pedra Branca
do Amapari, Coordenadoria de Vigilância em Saúde do Amapá, Laboratório
Central de Saúde Pública do Amapá, Instituto René Rachou (Fiocruz-MG),
Universidade Federal do Amapá, Universidade de São Paulo, and Universidade
Federal do Oeste do Pará. Multidisciplinary teams were assembled, comprising
entomologists, biologists, veterinarians, laboratory technicians, anthropologists, epidemiologists, and nurses.
