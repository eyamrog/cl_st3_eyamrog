This perspective positions physical education (PE) primarily as a means
to promote health or prevent disease, grounded in the widely
disseminated discourse of the "active body." In this context, PE
aligns with the World Health Organization’s (WHO) definition of health
as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being.
However, this approach tends to prioritize individuals’ biophysical conditions, which
can be considered a limited or restrictive conception of health.
