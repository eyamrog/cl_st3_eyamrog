Unlike most studies on brokerage between officeholders in Brazil, which
primarily utilize quantitative analyses, this paper adopts a multi-method approach.
We combine quantitative and qualitative descriptive evidence to address the
following research questions: How are relationships between state representatives and
local politicians established, maintained, and terminated? Furthermore, we assess whether
principal-agent models, which underpin much of the analysis in comparative
politics, offer an adequate framework for describing and analyzing these
relationships in the Brazilian context.
