The modernization of Ecuadorian institutions was closely associated with the
visit of the Kemmerer Mission, which provided recommendations to the
government regarding the establishment of the Central Bank of Ecuador.
This institution centralized the issuance of currency, and its creation
was accompanied by the establishment of several regulatory bodies, including
the Comptroller General of the State and the Superintendency of
Banks. Additionally, the gold standard was adopted as the primary
monetary policy. Similar processes occurred in many Latin American countries,
involving the creation of national banks, the establishment of regulatory
institutions, and the reintroduction of the gold standard.
