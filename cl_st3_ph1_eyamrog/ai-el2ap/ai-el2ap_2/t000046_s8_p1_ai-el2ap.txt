Bracht (2013) and Rufino and Darido (2013) indicate that Physical
Education (PE) has consistently addressed health-related topics. Until the 1980s,
PE primarily focused on fitness and movement through the use
of gymnastic methods and sports, emphasizing an instrumental approach to
student health (Paiva et al., 2017). In this study, this
approach is defined as the traditional model of Physical Education.
