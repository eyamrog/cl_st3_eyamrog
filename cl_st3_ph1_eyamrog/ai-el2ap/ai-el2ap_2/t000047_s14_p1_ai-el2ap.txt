This study examines the types of modes present within a
semiotic system, with the objective of identifying how semiotic resources
interact to produce comprehensive meaning potentials. This focus informs the
selection of a New Oral-B Toothpaste advertisement on YouTube as
the primary data source. The choice of a YouTube-based document
is justified by the platform’s extensive repository of advertising content
and its status as a widely used social media site
that attracts millions of users (Adami, 2015b). Additionally, the selection
of a New Oral-B Toothpaste advertisement is relevant due to
the product’s prominence as a fast-moving consumer good in Sub-Saharan
Africa. The advertisement is particularly notable for its use of
the metaphorical "2-IN-1" concept as a key marketing strategy, employing
both animate and inanimate participants to convey notions of interchangeability
(Williamson, 2002).
