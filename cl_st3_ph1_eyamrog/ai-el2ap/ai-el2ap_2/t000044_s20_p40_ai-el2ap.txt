Chu and Kita (2016) provide evidence that co-judgment gestures and
co-speech gestures share several properties, indicating that they may be
generated by a common underlying mechanism. Their findings show that
individuals produce a greater number of co-speech gestures when speech
production is more challenging compared to when it is less
challenging. Similarly, individuals produce more judgment-related gestures during silent problem-solving
tasks when the tasks are more difficult than when they
are less difficult.
