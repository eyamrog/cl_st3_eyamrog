Medical cannabis has been investigated as a potential analgesic in
a case study that reported a reduction in malignant fungating
wound (MFW)-related pain. Cannabinoids, which are compounds derived from the
Cannabis sativa plant, have been the focus of research following
the identification of cannabinoid receptors in peripheral neurons. This discovery
has led to the development and evaluation of topical cannabinoid-based
formulations. In animal studies, cannabinoids, either administered alone or in
combination with other analgesics, have demonstrated analgesic effects and have
been associated with an enhancement of the antinociceptive effects of
morphine (Maida et al., 2021; Nielsen et al., 2017).
