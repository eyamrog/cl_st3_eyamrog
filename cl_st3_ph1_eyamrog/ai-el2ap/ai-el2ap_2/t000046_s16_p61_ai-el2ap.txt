Given the current context, it is important to note that
both the National Curriculum Parameters (PCN) regarding the cross-sectional health
theme (BRASIL, 2000) and the National Common Curricular Base (BNCC)
(BRASIL, 2017) identify health as a distinct area of knowledge
that should be addressed by various curricular components across all
levels of basic education. These guidelines emphasize the need to
consider students' developmental stages and advocate for a progressive approach
to content delivery.
