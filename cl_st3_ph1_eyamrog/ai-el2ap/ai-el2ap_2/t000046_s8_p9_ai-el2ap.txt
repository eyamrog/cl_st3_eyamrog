Focusing on health-related actions, both Oliveira, Martins, and Bracht (2015a)
and Lopes, Nogueira, and Rocha (2018) identified the need for
targeted training and professional development for school personnel to effectively
address this topic. Bagnara and Fensterseifer (2019) further observed that
physical education teachers often engage in instruction without a clear
understanding of the curricular objectives related to health, highlighting the
importance of conducting research in this area to promote a
broader and more comprehensive perspective on health education.
