Instead of relying solely on theoretical assumptions regarding the motivations
of actors and the anticipated outcomes of alliances, the interviews
offer a more comprehensive understanding of these processes and their
development over time. The interviews facilitate the identification of factors
underlying the quantitative findings reported in the literature and clarify
their operational mechanisms (Martin, 2013). Specifically, these factors pertain to
the perceptions and motivations of actors directly involved in the
formation of alliances, which are often not adequately captured by
survey methods. Therefore, by providing a more detailed account of
how actors make decisions, behave, and respond within their interactions,
the interviews can contribute to the generation of hypotheses and
the proposal of causal mechanisms (Martin, 2013; Kapiszewski, MacLean, and
Read, 2015).
