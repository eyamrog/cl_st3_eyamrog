As a preliminary step, with a sample size of 1,844
observations, the SALOMON splitting method was applied using the FACTOR
software (Lorenzo-Seva, 2021). The Ratio Communality Index (RCI) obtained was
0.998452, indicating that both subsamples possess a similar amount of
common variance; values closer to 1 suggest greater comparability between
subsamples (Lorenzo-Seva, 2021). The data exhibited significant kurtosis (p <
0.05), indicating a deviation from normality. Consequently, the Diagonally Weighted
Least Squares (RDWLS) extraction method was employed, as it is
appropriate for categorical data that do not follow a normal
distribution (Asparouhov & MuthÃ©n, 2010).
