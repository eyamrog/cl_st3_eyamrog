Data on satisfaction and masticatory ability were collected using a
questionnaire and a visual analog scale. The assessment of satisfaction
included the following parameters: general satisfaction, masticatory ability, stability, aesthetics,
phonetics, comfort, and ease of cleaning. Masticatory ability was evaluated
based on the patient's self-reported ability to chew specific foods,
including bread, cheese, meat, apples, coconut, carrots, tomatoes, and lettuce.
Additionally, a semi-structured interview was conducted to further assess the
degree of patient satisfaction with the dentures and to identify
any perceived benefits or drawbacks associated with their use.
