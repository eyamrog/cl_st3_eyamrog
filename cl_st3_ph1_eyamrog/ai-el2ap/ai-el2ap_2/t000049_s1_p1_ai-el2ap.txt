Several documents, including the "Proposal for Key Principles of a
Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education and Care" (2014) and
the "National Guidelines for the Curriculum" (2012), emphasize the significance
of formative evaluation as a process for research and innovation.
Educational evaluation, conducted through the observation and analysis of educational
documentation, enables teachers to assess and refine their educational approaches
to enhance learning outcomes. In this context, the present discussion
focuses on research related to scientific education in nursery schools,
drawing on theoretical frameworks provided by Dewey (1933, 1938), Vygotsky
(1930, 1934), Wood, Bruner, and Ross (1976), psychoanalytic perspectives on
curiosity as a function of psychic processes, and the work
of Susan Isaacs (1930, 1933) at the Malting House. The
primary objective of this research is to identify the conditions—specifically,
aspects of space, materials, and adult engagement—that most effectively support
scientific inquiry among children. The concept of "promoting from within"
(Bondioli, 2008; Bondioli & Savio, 2009; Bondioli, 2015) serves as
a guiding principle for structuring adult interventions aimed at fostering
the development of a scientific mindset. Data collection methods included
videotaping, the use of observation protocols, and the development of
two analytical grids: one focused on children's epistemic behaviors and
the other on adult strategies and functions. The initial analysis
provided insights into how specific elements of the educational context—such
as adult intervention strategies, materials, and spatial organization—can facilitate the
development of a scientific attitude, particularly in relation to the
acquisition of critical thinking skills.
