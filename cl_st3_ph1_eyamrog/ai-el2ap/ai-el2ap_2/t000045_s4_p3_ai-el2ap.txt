These conclusions regarding the Brazilian case may have broader relevance
for other contexts, particularly those characterized by: (i) decentralization, where
municipalities possess political autonomy, hold responsibilities in key policy areas,
and local politicians occupy significant roles within the political system;
(ii) electoral systems in which municipal elections are conducted independently
from elections at other governmental levels; and (iii) environments with
weakly institutionalized party systems, where alternative factors play a crucial
role in the formation of multilevel political alliances.
