Chue, Lee, and Tan (2015) conducted a study within the
field of Chemistry higher education in Singapore. The study first
included a brief literature review on communication and education to
identify the potential contributions of iconic gestures in science education.
Subsequently, the researchers analyzed the iconic gestures used by a
university professor when illustrating abstract concepts such as the size,
position, and movement of particles. Their findings indicate that iconic
gestures can clarify aspects of abstract scientific meaning and may
provide a more comprehensive representation of meaning than speech alone.
