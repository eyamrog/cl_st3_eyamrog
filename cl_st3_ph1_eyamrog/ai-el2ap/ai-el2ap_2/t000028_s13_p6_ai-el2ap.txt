Due to the limited number of relevant publications in Applied
Linguistics journals, the search was conducted using the Scientific Electronic
Library Online (SciELO) platform. The search strategy required that the
term “blind” appear in the title, and that the terms
“teaching” and “school” be present in the title, abstract, or
keywords. Additional filters were applied to refine the results: (a)
the journal had to be related to education; (b) the
texts had to be open access; and (c) only articles
or review articles were included, as specified in the genre
category (Tipos de Literatura). This search yielded a total of
nine papers.
