After several months characterized by political instability, labor pressures, and
legislative negotiations, the Organic Labor Law was enacted in 1936,
thereby establishing minimum wage regulations in the country (Registro Oficial
No. 205, 1936). This legislation reflected the agreements reached among
the primary stakeholders, specifically the workers, industrialists, and the central
government.
