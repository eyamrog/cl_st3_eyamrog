This study examined the correlation between anxiety and the use
of anxiolytic medications among university students in health-related fields. The
results indicated that 58.8% of the participants reported using anxiolytic
drugs, with the majority of users being students in advanced
stages of their programs. The findings suggest that the presence
of anxiety symptoms is associated with an increased likelihood of
seeking pharmacological interventions to manage the demands of academic activities
(Nogueira et al., 2021; PÃ©rez et al., 2023).
