“Health is characterized by the absence of conditions such as
high blood pressure and obesity, and by not requiring medication.
In my case, I take medications for hypertension, depression, and
cardiac arrhythmia; in my view, being healthy would mean not
needing any of these treatments” (Bruna – Geography teacher).
