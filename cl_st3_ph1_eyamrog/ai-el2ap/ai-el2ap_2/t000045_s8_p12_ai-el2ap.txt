Several studies have demonstrated that mayors often establish relationships with
state and national representatives to facilitate investments in infrastructure and
public works projects, which are widely regarded as key indicators
of effective local administration (Palmeira and Goldman, 1996; Bezerra, 1999).
Additionally, mayors may present these connections to voters as evidence
of their political influence and capacity to secure resources for
the municipality (Chaves, 1996; Bezerra, 1999; Eduardo, 2016). Conversely, many
legislators also rely on mayors to claim credit for the
distribution of benefits, enhance their reputations within their constituencies, and
ultimately increase their electoral support.
