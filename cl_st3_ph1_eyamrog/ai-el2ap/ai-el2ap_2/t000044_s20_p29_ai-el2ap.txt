Glasser et al. (2018) investigated whether children comprehend iconic gestures
representing events as early as those representing entities, and whether
this comprehension is influenced by gesture production patterns in their
native language. The study found that childrenâ€™s understanding of event-related
iconic gestures was affected by the native gesture production patterns,
with greater comprehension observed for gestures that conformed to the
specific patterns of their native language, particularly regarding the manner
of movement, compared to gestures that did not align with
these patterns.
