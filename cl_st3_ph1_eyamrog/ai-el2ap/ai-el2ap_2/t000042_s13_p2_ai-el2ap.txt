João Doria, the governor of São Paulo—a relatively affluent state—implemented
measures such as promoting mask usage, establishing restrictions, and advocating
for coordination with federal authorities in response to the COVID-19
pandemic. Doria, a businessman with presidential ambitions for the October
2022 election in which President Bolsonaro was seeking re-election, faced
strong criticism from Bolsonaro for these actions. Concurrently, official campaigns
with anti-communist and xenophobic rhetoric were initiated, contributing to an
increase in hate crimes against Asian Brazilians; it is notable
that Brazil has the largest population of migrants from Japan
and China in Latin America. Despite research indicating that the
majority of COVID-19 cases among Brazilians originated in Italy, China
was publicly accused of deliberately spreading the pandemic.
