Unit 3 comprises three activities. The first activity focuses on
reviewing vocabulary related to occupations, where students are presented with
images and are required to write the corresponding occupation for
each image. The second activity addresses the months of the
year by providing students with an incomplete calendar and instructing
them to fill in the correct months. The third activity
pertains to countries and nationalities; students are shown images of
national flags and are asked to identify both the country
and the corresponding nationality associated with each flag.
