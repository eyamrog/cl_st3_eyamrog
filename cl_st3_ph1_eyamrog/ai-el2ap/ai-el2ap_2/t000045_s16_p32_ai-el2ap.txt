However, our findings indicate that political parties may not be
the sole or even the primary factor structuring alliances. Consequently,
our analysis shifts from assessing whether party affiliations are significant
to examining the conditions under which their importance diminishes relative
to other factors, which are more difficult to quantify but
nonetheless influential in partner selection and alliance formation. In the
in-depth interviews, chiefs of staff consistently reported that political parties
play little or no role in the formation of local
alliances. They generally stated that representatives form alliances with leaders
from various parties and that party affiliation is not the
most decisive criterion. While it could be argued that this
perspective is influenced by the specific profile of the legislators
included in our interviews—namely, those with electoral support concentrated in
neighboring municipalities—the survey data from a broader sample of legislators
supports this finding. Only a minority of respondents identified party
relations as the most important reason for securing the support
of mayors and councilors, with 14% in 2007 and 21%
in 2012 indicating this view.
