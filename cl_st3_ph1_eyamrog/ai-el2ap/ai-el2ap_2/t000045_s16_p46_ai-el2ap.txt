Mayors present their requests to the legislator, often seeking assistance
with particularly complex projects, and in these cases, we provide
support by formulating appropriate arguments. The mayors frequently encounter significant
challenges in this process, and, given our expertise, we offer
guidance and assistance. We receive the relevant documents, process them,
and follow the necessary administrative procedures (Chief of Staff 2).
