The video advertisement for the new Oral-BÂ® toothpaste (hereafter referred
to as Oral-B) analyzed in this study exemplifies the interaction
of human and material actions, which are mediated at both
higher and lower levels. The modes present in copresence facilitate
these actions within specific environments, and their varying affordances encompass
both animate and inanimate materiality. In accordance with the theoretical
framework outlined in Figure 1, this investigation considers written modes
(Halliday & Matthiessen, 2014; Dalamu, 2018b), images (Kress & van
Leeuwen, 2021; Baldry & Thibault, 2010), proxemics (Norris, 2019), and
gestures (Kendon, 2015) as relevant domains of analysis. The discussion
is organized according to the sequential presentation of modes, identified
as HLMA 1, HLMA 2, HLMA 3, and HLMA 4.
The total duration of the advertisement is 30 seconds.
