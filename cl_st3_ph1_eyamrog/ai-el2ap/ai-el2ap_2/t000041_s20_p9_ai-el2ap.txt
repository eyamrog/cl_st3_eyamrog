The study area demonstrates significant potential for conservation due to
its high rates of endemism, with 94 species identified as
endemic to Brazil. Among these, Trianthema portulacastrum L., Ruellia bahiensis
(Nees) Morong, and Harpochilus paraibanus F.K.S. Monteiro, J.I.M. Melo &
E.M.P. Fernando are species that are exclusive to the Caatinga
region (BFG 2021).
