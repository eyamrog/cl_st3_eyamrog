The search process was conducted in three stages. First, an
initial search was carried out in the MEDLINE and CINAHL
databases using the terms "Wounds and Injuries," "Neoplasms," "Pain Management,"
and "Administration, Topical" to identify additional relevant keywords. Second, a
subsequent search was performed utilizing all keywords and descriptors identified
in the included databases. Third, with the assistance of a
librarian, a tailored search equation was developed for each database.
The specific search strategy for CINAHL (EBSCO) is presented in
Table 1. No time restrictions were applied to the search
equations, which covered the period from 2019 to 2020 and
were updated in March 2022. Additionally, the reference lists of
the selected studies were reviewed to identify further relevant studies.
