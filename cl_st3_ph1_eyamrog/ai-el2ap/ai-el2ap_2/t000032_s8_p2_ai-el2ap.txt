Engelmann (1986, p. 121) defines mood states as “fundamental patterns
of general functioning and orientation,” representing “the effect upon a
person of his own configuration of activity,” which closely aligns
with the concept of feeling as understood in everyday language
(Bueno & Souza, 2019; Engelmann, 1986). Although the investigation of
athletes’ subjective experiences presupposes the study of a wide range
of states, research has primarily focused on negative aspects such
as depression, anxiety, and stress, mainly because these factors are
considered to have a detrimental effect on sports performance (Frame
& Reichin, 2019; Rocha & Osório, 2018).
