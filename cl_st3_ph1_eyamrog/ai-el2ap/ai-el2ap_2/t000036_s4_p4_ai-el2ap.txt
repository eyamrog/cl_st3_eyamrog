The first group contains limited information regarding labor; however, the
article indicates that this group is primarily engaged in the
production and consumption of agricultural products, including sugar, cotton, corn,
rice, bananas, pineapples, oranges, and lemons. In the second group,
available data show that daily wages paid in haciendas or
bakeries range from 2 to 5 sucres. In the third
group, salary levels vary according to the skill level of
workers, with distinctions made between unskilled and skilled labor.
