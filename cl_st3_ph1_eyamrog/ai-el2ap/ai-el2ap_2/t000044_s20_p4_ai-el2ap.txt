After establishing the initial, predefined categories of analysis (such as
year and school level), a secondary categorization was conducted. In
order to assess the contribution of gestures to the teaching
and learning process, the articles identified in the literature review
were grouped into categories relevant to addressing the research question.
These categories were determined through a systematic review of the
articles, based on observed similarities and the specific ways in
which each article contributed to understanding the role of gestures
in educational contexts.
