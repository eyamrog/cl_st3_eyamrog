Although physical education (PE) has moved beyond a narrow focus
on physical fitness, it continues to be regarded as a
fundamental component of basic education curricula. In relation to health,
PE necessitates the adoption of critical pedagogical approaches. Based on
the existing literature addressing this topic, it is anticipated that
the critical integration of the BNCC (Base Nacional Comum Curricular)
within the field will promote a vision of PE that
supports the cultural development of individuals. Consequently, health can be
discussed collectively by considering its social determinants, and the cultural
practices of the body—such as games, gymnastics, sports, dance, and
martial arts—can serve as foundational elements for pedagogical practices in
PE that are oriented toward social transformation. Ultimately, this approach
seeks to challenge prevailing contemporary discourses in PE, particularly the
notion that equates physical activity solely with health.
