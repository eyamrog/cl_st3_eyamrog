In examining the labor conditions of workers during the 1930s,
it is pertinent to analyze the establishment of the minimum
wage as a form of state and legal recognition of
the minimum income required to support an individual. In Ecuador,
the legalization of the minimum wage accounted for regional and
occupational differences; for instance, a wage of 25 sucres was
set for jobs in the interior, 50 sucres for coastal
jobs, and 37.5 sucres for positions in the capital. The
following section will review the implementation of minimum wage regulations
in Latin America.
