Brokers are typically unelected individuals who occupy leadership positions or
possess social or political capital that enables them to influence
voters. However, brokers may also hold public office, most commonly
at the local level. Their activities are not limited to
electoral processes; they often play a significant role in addressing
community issues (Auyero, 2001; Brierley and Nathan, 2021) and may
participate in the implementation of government functions at the local
level (Auyero, 2000; Zarazaga, 2014; Hoyler, Gelape, and Silotto, 2021).
