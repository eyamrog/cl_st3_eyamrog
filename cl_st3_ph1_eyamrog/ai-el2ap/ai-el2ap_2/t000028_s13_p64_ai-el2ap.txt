One group or pair at a time, students are required
to answer the question “Which month…?” as posed by the
EAL teacher (for example: Which month starts the summer in
Brazil? Which month are we in now? In which month
is Halloween celebrated?). The teacher may prompt students to take
turns within their groups to ensure that all members participate
and collaborate to provide accurate responses. Similar to the initial
proposal, this adaptation targets the development of listening and speaking
skills and is designed as an engaging activity to promote
participation and inclusion among students.
