In this context, both researchers and supervisors should remain open
to hypotheses that arise from the analysis of collected data,
while ensuring the scientific coherence of the project is maintained.
This approach underscores the importance of fostering a collaborative workgroup
that is receptive to new hypotheses through constructive discussion. It
is essential that each workgroup receives appropriate professional training that
promotes dialogue, critical reflection, and self-evaluation as key tools for
guiding educational practice. Consequently, such training should prepare teachers to
engage in research alongside children, equipping them to manage the
emotional challenges and uncertainties inherent in this process, and enabling
them to address doubts and periods of uncertainty without resorting
to prematurely explaining concepts, transmitting predetermined knowledge, or proposing activities
that do not align with the interests of the children.
