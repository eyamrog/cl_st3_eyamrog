Despite the low levels of party identification and the personalization
associated with Brazilâ€™s open-list proportional representation system, it is unlikely
that political parties do not play a significant role in
the Brazilian electoral process. Political parties remain the sole legal
channel for candidacy in public office and control essential resources
during elections, including funding, political advertising time on television and
radio, and various organizational assets. Furthermore, the focus of academic
studies on party labels is justified, as party affiliation constitutes
a readily accessible and measurable variable.
