Fisher's exact test was applied to square contingency tables, where
the number of rows and columns is equal, while Pearson's
chi-square test (Ï‡2) was used for non-square tables, where the
number of rows and columns differs; both tests were conducted
to assess the distribution of variables in relation to symptomatic
levels of anxiety, as measured by the IDATE-T and IDATE-E
scores.
