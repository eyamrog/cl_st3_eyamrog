Thus, initiatives such as the School Health Program (PSE) (BRASIL,
2007) facilitate not only the implementation of health-focused pedagogical activities
but also promote coordinated network actions, thereby enhancing the identification
and management of risk behaviors (Oliveira, Martins, & Bracht, 2015b).
Carneiro and Coutinho (2015) report a significant increase in the
identification and referral of students by schools to mental health
services, indicating an increased attention to studentsâ€™ mental health needs.
This represents a promising example of intersectoral collaboration.
