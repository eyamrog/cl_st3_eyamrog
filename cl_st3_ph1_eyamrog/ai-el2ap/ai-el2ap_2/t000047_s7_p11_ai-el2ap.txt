Given this explanation, it can be argued that there are
identifiable norms that define the concept of mode. Mode can
be understood as a text, a process, a product, a
choice, an animate or inanimate entity, a system, a coherent
structure, and a meaningful construct. The classification of mode as
text refers to the meaning-making entity, which may manifest as
words, images, gazes, or gestures. These elements prompt a social
actor to select the mode most appropriate for a given
semiotic system. In this context, the notion of choice connects
readers to the paradigmatic perspective of text. The process of
selection reflects the method by which modes are processed within
a particular context. Drawing on Halliday and Matthiessenâ€™s (2014) framework,
the paradigmatic axis represents the communicative dimension of what can
substitute for what, thereby excluding unselected options. The outcome of
paradigmatic selection is realized in the syntagmatic arrangement.
