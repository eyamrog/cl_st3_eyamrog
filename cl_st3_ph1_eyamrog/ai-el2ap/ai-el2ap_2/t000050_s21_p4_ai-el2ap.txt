The Suruwaha Indigenous Land (SIL) is situated within the municipality
of Tapauá and encompasses an area of 239,070 hectares. It
is located between the Riozinho River and the Coxodoá stream,
both of which are tributaries of the Cuniuá River; the
Cuniuá River is itself a tributary of the Tapauá River,
which ultimately flows into the Purus River [18]. The SIL
is bordered to the west by the Deni Indigenous Land
and to the east by the Hi-Merimã Indigenous Land, both
of which are inhabited by isolated indigenous groups. The Suruwaha
population consists of 171 individuals who lived in isolation until
their initial contact with missionaries in the 1980s [14]. The
primary subsistence activities of the Suruwaha include agriculture, hunting, fishing,
gathering, and tool production [19]. Among these, hunting is regarded
as the most prestigious activity; hunters are evaluated not only
by the quantity of animals they kill but also by
their success in hunting tapirs, which are considered the most
valued game due to their large size and capacity to
provide food for many people [19].
