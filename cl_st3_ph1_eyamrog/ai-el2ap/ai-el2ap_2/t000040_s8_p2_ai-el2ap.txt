The location and course of the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN)
place it at risk during mandibular surgical procedures [4,5]. Injury
to the nerve bundle or its branches can result in
temporary or permanent loss of tactile sensation in the lower
lip and chin [4]. In a 2005 study, Robert et
al. reported that 94.5% of surveyed California oral and maxillofacial
surgeons had encountered IAN injury during mandibular surgeries within a
12-month period [4]. The dimensions and trajectory of the mandibular
canal (MC) are critical parameters for effective surgical planning. Therefore,
adequate preoperative visualization of the MC is essential for reducing
the risk of IAN morbidity and improving patient safety [6,7].
