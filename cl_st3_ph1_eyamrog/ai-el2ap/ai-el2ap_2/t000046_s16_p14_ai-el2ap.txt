Health comprises various elements. For young people in particular, it
is important to reduce their use of devices such as
cell phones and headsets and encourage greater participation in sports,
as engaging in physical activity can help prevent illness, including
mental health issues, and positively influence their perception of health.
Overall, health involves both a sound mind and a healthy
body. (Nara â€“ Portuguese language teacher).
