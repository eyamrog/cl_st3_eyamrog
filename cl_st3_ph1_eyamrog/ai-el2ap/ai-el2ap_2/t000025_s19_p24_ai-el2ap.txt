In four studies (5%), topical cryotherapy was utilized for the
management of malignant fungating wound (MFW)-related pain, although pain control
was not the primary objective; instead, cryotherapy was employed as
part of broader symptom management. The included studies comprised non-systematic
reviews (50%), surveys (25%), and guidelines (25%). These studies did
not provide specific information regarding the methods of cryotherapy application
or report outcomes related to its use.
