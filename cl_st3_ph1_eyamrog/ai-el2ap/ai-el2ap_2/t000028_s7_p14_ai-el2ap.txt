An analysis of recent didactic materials and textbooks indicates that
the majority incorporate numerous visual elements and multimodal texts, including
images, drawings, maps, and posters. While these components play a
significant role in education, language teaching materials are not required
to rely exclusively on visual content (TEACHING LANGUAGES TO BLIND
AND VISUALLY IMPAIRED STUDENTS, 2022), as alternative instructional methods exist
that are inclusive of students who are blind or visually
impaired.
