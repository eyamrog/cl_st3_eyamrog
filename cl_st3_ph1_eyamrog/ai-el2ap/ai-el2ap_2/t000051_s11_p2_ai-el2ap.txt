Policy statements function as instruments of leadership for German chancellors,
and their increasing use over time reflects the characteristics of
a mediatised democracy. As public presentations, these policy statements attract
significant media attention and thereby serve to visibly associate government
policy with the chancellor (Korte, 2002, p. 453). Given their
dual role as tools for both public communication and internal
coordination, policy statements are typically informed by a variety of
sources, including scientific research, surveys, contemporary opinions, and other perspectives;
the selection and integration of these sources often reflect the
individual style of the chancellor (Korte, 2002, pp. 460–461). Research
on this genre within German political discourse has primarily focused
on inaugural policy statements delivered by chancellors at the start
of their terms (Barnickel, 2020; Busch & Kaupert, 2018; Stüwe,
2005), although analyses of legitimisation strategies have also been conducted
on a regular basis (see, for example, Reyes, 2011).
