The Law of Responsibility for Work Accidents and Procedures, enacted
in 1928, consists of two main sections: the first addresses
the responsibilities of workers in cases of accidents and work-related
illnesses, while the second outlines the obligations of employers concerning
the partial disability of employees resulting from occupational incidents. According
to Guerrero (1937:22), the legislation stipulates that victims are entitled
to compensation equivalent to two years' salary.
