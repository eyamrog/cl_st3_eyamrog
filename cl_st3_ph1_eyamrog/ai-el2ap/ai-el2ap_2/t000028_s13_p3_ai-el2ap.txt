While conducting research on social issues in which language plays
a constitutive role, this study aims not only to analyze
these issues but also to promote interventions addressing the identified
problems (Schlatter, 2009), thereby adopting an Applied Linguistics perspective. Mason
(2002) argues that qualitative research should be undertaken as a
moral practice and with consideration of its political context (p.
8). In this study, we address the lack of adapted
English as an Additional Language (EAL) materials for blind students
in the 6th grade. Consequently, this research is also propositional
in nature, as it provides an adaptation of EAL activities
to better meet the learning needs of blind students.
