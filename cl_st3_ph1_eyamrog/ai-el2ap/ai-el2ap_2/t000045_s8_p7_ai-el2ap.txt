While acknowledging the significance of local political actors as brokers
for legislators, our findings indicate that principal-agent theories—the predominant framework
for analyzing these relationships (Stokes et al., 2013)—are limited in
their applicability to the Brazilian context, particularly when brokers themselves
hold elective office and assume dual roles. Specifically, our results
do not support the assumptions that an inherent conflict of
objectives exists between brokers and principals, or that informational asymmetry
consistently favors brokers, irrespective of contextual factors.
