The aforementioned concepts support the view of evaluation as a
research process in which teachers, who share common values and
pedagogical principles, collaboratively theorize developmental trajectories through observation, documentation, and
assessment. These processes are intended to facilitate the re-examination of
educational experiences and to identify potential improvements in both methodological
approaches (such as observation and documentation) and interpretative perspectives. From
this perspective, evaluation is not a unidirectional process—such as a
teacher solely judging students or a researcher merely assessing outcomes—but
rather a multidimensional process characterized by the interaction of various
influencing factors. Conceptualizing evaluation as a research process necessitates that
teachers employ flexible and participatory intervention strategies, which are not
based on preconceived notions but instead allow for critical reflection
on their own educational and didactic practices. This approach supports
the enhancement of children's daily experiences, curiosity, diversity, and individual
responses. Furthermore, the capacity to critically discuss and reflect on
adult decision-making in creating educational environments that foster cognitive development
requires a willingness to relinquish certainties and engage with the
inherent uncertainty of the educational process (Bion, 1973). Managing the
associated anxiety is essential to avoid resorting to predetermined solutions
and to maintain a reflective and adaptive stance.
