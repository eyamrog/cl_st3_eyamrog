The minimum wage was first established and legalized in the
public sector. A legal decree issued on September 28, 1934,
divided public sector workers into two geographical zones, designated as
zone A and zone E. In zone A, the minimum
wage was set at 160 pesos per month or 6.40
pesos per day, while in zone E, it was set
at 90 pesos per month or 3.60 pesos per day.
Minimum wage regulations were subsequently extended to the private sector,
being implemented for the textile industry on April 15, 1935,
and for footwear companies on June 9, 1937.
