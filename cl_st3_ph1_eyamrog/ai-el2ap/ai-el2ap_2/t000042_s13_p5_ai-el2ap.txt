On June 6, the Supreme Court compelled the government to
publish more accurate data on coronavirus infections, hospitalizations, and fatalities.
Nevertheless, under-reporting persisted due to extremely low testing rates. In
the Amazon region, the government was particularly effective in obscuring
mortality data, despite the Supreme Courtâ€™s order to protect over
300 indigenous communities, comprising approximately 900,000 individuals. The prior weakening
of environmental regulations had facilitated the exploitation of indigenous lands
and enabled increased contact between indigenous populations and external actors
such as farmers, land leasers, and miners, thereby increasing the
risk of coronavirus transmission. This approach reflected a broader governmental
perspective that regarded indigenous populations as impediments to economic development.
From March 2020 onward, many indigenous communities in the Amazon
implemented self-isolation measures in an effort to reduce their coronavirus
mortality rate, which was 32% higher than that of the
general population.
