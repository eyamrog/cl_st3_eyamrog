Empirical studies indicate that this cooperation yields electoral benefits for
both parties involved. Avelino, Biderman, and Barone (2012) and Barone
(2014) demonstrate that winning a mayoral election enhances a partyâ€™s
prospects in subsequent state and national elections. Concurrently, Eduardo (2016)
finds that alliances with legislators improve the electoral prospects of
mayors, particularly in small municipalities and in contexts where voters
perceive that such alliances will generate collective benefits for the
community.
