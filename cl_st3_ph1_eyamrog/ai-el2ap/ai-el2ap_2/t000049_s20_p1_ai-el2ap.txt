The use of audio-visual materials was essential, as it enabled
the researchers to review the meetings multiple times and systematically
identify additional details with each viewing. Furthermore, these materials facilitated
the participation of additional observers during the analysis phase, particularly
process supervisors. The involvement of supervisors served to minimize potential
subjectivity and to incorporate diverse perspectives, thereby enhancing the rigor
of the analysis. Ongoing documentation and iterative review of the
process allowed the researchers to identify critical issues and, when
necessary, to reconsider and adjust the intervention. Analysis of the
recorded materials also supported the development of analytical tables that
described the scientific attitudes exhibited by the children, as well
as the strategies and actions employed by the adult to
foster cognitive development, in alignment with the ‘promotion from within’
approach. These activities are consistent with the evaluative framework outlined
in the introduction, which emphasizes an evaluation process that “proceeds,
accompanies, and follows” (Indicazioni Nazionali, 2012, p.19) the learning process.
In accordance with this perspective, the researchers and supervisors analyzed
the recordings and were able to systematically describe both the
scientific attitudes demonstrated by the children and the strategies implemented
by the adult.
