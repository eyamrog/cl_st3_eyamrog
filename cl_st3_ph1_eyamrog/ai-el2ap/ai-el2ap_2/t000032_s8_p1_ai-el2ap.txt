A subjective emotional experience, also referred to as feeling or
sensation, constitutes the core component of emotion, while its objective
manifestations are observed through influences on behavior or physiological signals
from the body or brain, which serve as indirect indicators
of these internal experiences. Consequently, verbal self-reports are considered the
most effective method for accessing these feelings (LeDoux & Hofmann,
2018). Assessments of subjective states through athletesâ€™ verbal reports can
provide valuable information regarding their psychological conditions (Bueno & Souza,
2019).
