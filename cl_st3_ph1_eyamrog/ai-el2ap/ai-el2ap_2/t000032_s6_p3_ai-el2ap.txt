Factor VII (Interest) appears to be present approximately 40 minutes
prior to the match, as also reported by Bueno and
Di Bonifácio (2007), Dias-Silva (2013), Di Bonifácio (2013), and Silva
(2013). This factor is associated with organic activation and motivation.
Pujals and Vieira (2002) identified a specific interest in performance
improvement among young soccer athletes, which constitutes a motivational factor
related to the need for achievement (Brunstein & Heckhausen, 2018)
as well as to both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation (Brunstein,
2018). Gea Garcia et al. (2016) demonstrated that the temporal
proximity to competitive matches increases the intensity of Vigor and
Tension, as measured by the POMS factors, in college athletes.
In the present study, the highest values for Factor XII
(Serenity) were observed at time points more distant from the
matches. It should be noted that differences in competition level
and age range exist between these studies, and further research
into the influence of these variables on the presence of
this factor is warranted.
