Kim et al. investigated the bucco-lingual position of the mandibular
canal (MC) and the topography of the inferior alveolar nerve
(IAN) using three-dimensional reconstruction on sixty-two mandibular sides. Their findings
indicate that 70% of the canals followed the lingual aspect
at both the ramus and the mandibular body, 15% were
located in the middle of the ramus behind the second
molar and shifted lingually when passing through the second and
first molars, and the remaining 15% followed either the middle
or the lingual third of the mandible from the ramus
to the body. Additionally, Kim et al. reported that the
inferior alveolar vessels were positioned superior to the IAN in
80% of cases and lateral to it in 20% of
cases [10].
