The second step examines how the identified discourses are positioned
in relation to one another, specifically how they are either
foregrounded or marginalized. To achieve this, I utilize the concept
of engagement resources, defined as linguistic strategies that construct a
heteroglossic context by referencing prior statements, alternative perspectives, and anticipated
responses (Martin & White, 2005, p. 97). These resources are
categorized as either dialogically expansive or contractive, as outlined in
Section 3. Dialogically contractive resources include disclaim (deny, counter) and
proclaim (concur, pronounce, endorse), while dialogically expansive resources comprise entertain
and attribute (acknowledge, distance) (Martin & White, 2005, p. 134).
For a more comprehensive explanation of these resources, refer to
Martin and White (2005, pp. 97â€“98).
