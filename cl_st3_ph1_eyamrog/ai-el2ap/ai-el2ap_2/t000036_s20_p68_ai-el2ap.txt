Workers on the Coast earned 1.2 sucres, whereas workers in
the Sierra received 0.60 sucres. For individuals under 18 years
of age and for women, regardless of whether they were
employed in the manual or agricultural sectors, the minimum wage
was set at two-thirds of the standard rate. The legislation
did not specify the wages for domestic workers (Pan American
Union 1937).
