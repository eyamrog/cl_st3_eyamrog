Zappe and Dellâ€™Aglio (2016) identify the experimental phase as encompassing
behaviors such as inappropriate eating habits, engagement in certain sports
practices, antisocial behavior, use of substances including alcohol, cigarettes, and
drugs, risky sexual behavior, suicidal behavior, and violence, noting that
these behaviors may be associated with a lack of parental
support. Accordingly, it is important for schools to monitor these
situations and provide a supportive environment for students.
