Recent scholarship has begun to examine the relationship between local
politicians and legislators in Brazil using a theoretical framework centered
on the concept of brokers (Eduardo, 2016; Novaes, 2018). This
approach provides clear foundations, premises, and observable implications for analyzing
these relationships and situates the phenomenon within the broader comparative
politics literature. The following section outlines the main characteristics of
brokers and the mechanisms of intermediation described by these theories,
while also critically assessing their applicability to the Brazilian context.
