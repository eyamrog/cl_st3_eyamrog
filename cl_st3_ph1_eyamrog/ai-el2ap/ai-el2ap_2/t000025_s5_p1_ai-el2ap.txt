This scoping review aimed to systematically map and analyze the
existing literature on topical management of malignant fungating wound (MFW)-related
pain, with particular consideration of its relevance for oncology and
palliative care clinicians. The synthesis of this literature may offer
insights into potential treatments that could improve quality of life,
particularly for patients with terminal cancer (Schmidt et al., 2020).
To the best of the authorsâ€™ knowledge, this is the
first scoping review in this field designed to inform researchers
seeking to advance research directions and identify gaps in current
knowledge.
