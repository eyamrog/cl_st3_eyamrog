Syntagmatic relations refer to a set of items arranged along
a horizontal axis that collectively generate a semantic syntagm, which
can be derived from lexico-grammatical structures. The coherence among paradigmatic
modal entities, which together constitute a unified semiotic presence, contributes
to the production of meaning. In this context, Kress and
van Leeuwen (2001) observe that modes consist of elements that
are both lexically arranged and grammatically organized within simple and
complex systems of meaning, a structure that may be analogous
to the hierarchical organization found in language (Thompson, 2014; Dalamu,
2018c). Based on this analogy, it is reasonable to infer
that if elements in language are organized systemically, then modes
are also systemic, a characteristic that may warrant the application
of a system network. Therefore, modes can be regarded as
systems of meaning-making, as will be demonstrated in subsequent sections.
