To support this perspective, the association between anxiolytic medication use
and anxiety has been primarily examined in university student populations.
A global study by Auerbach et al. (2018) reported that
12.6% of university students exhibiting symptoms of anxiety were using
anxiolytic medications. The most frequently used medications in this group
were benzodiazepines (BZDs; 5.9%), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; 3.9%),
and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs; 2.2%). In Brazil, Souza et
al. (2022) found that 24.3% of medical students reported using
antidepressant and/or anxiolytic drugs.
