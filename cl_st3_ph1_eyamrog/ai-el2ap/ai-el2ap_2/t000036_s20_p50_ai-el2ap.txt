The minimum wage in Brazil was established through a series
of negotiations conducted between 1934 and 1937, during the presidency
of Getúlio Vargas (1930–1945). The 1934 Constitution of the Federative
Republic of Brazil formally sanctioned the minimum wage, defining it
as remuneration “capable of satisfying, according to the conditions of
each region, the normal needs of the worker” (Article 121).
