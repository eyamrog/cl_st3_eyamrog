The communicator in the New Oral-B Toothpaste video employs a
range of modes, including visual, auditory, and textual elements, to
construct a cohesive and comprehensive message. Visually, the video utilizes
imagery of the product, demonstrations of its use, and representations
of dental health to reinforce the toothpasteâ€™s benefits. Auditory components,
such as voiceover narration and background music, are used to
convey key information and create an engaging atmosphere. Textual elements,
including on-screen captions and product claims, further clarify and emphasize
the main points. By integrating these modes, the communicator ensures
that the message is accessible, persuasive, and easily understood by
a diverse audience, thereby achieving holistic meaning.
