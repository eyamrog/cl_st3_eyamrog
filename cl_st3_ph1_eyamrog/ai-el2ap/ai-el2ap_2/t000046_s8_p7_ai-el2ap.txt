Oliveira, Martins, and Bracht (2015a) emphasize that the discourse surrounding
physical activity as a means to achieve an active or
healthy lifestyle not only reinforces the notion that the systematization
of bodily movement serves specific objectives, but also functions as
a mechanism for the commodification of health, either directly or
indirectly. Similarly, contemporary society exhibits a tendency to foster consumer
relationships in this context. Westphal (2013) highlights the presence of
societal inducement, noting that media outlets promote the idea of
free choice within a market-driven framework, which can ultimately result
in the imposition of particular healthy lifestyle norms.
