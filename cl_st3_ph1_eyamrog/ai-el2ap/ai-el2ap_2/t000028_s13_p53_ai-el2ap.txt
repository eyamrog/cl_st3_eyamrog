Subsequent activities focus on reinforcing the vocabulary introduced in Unit
4. One exercise reviews school subjects by requiring students to
label figures with the appropriate subject names. Another exercise addresses
the days of the week, instructing students to write the
seven days in the correct order. Additionally, there is an
activity related to Unit 5 content, in which students complete
a family tree by identifying and labeling family members. The
next exercise, which reviews vocabulary from Unit 6, presents images
of parts of a house and various pieces of furniture,
prompting students to write the corresponding terms beneath each image.
