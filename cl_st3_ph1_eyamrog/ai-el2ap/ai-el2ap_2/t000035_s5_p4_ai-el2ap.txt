The quality of the dentures produced in the village was
assessed using a questionnaire designed to measure patient satisfaction, which
is a widely used method for evaluating treatment outcomes. The
“dentures in one day” approach received positive evaluations, as indicated
by the mean patient ratings for upper and lower dentures
in the categories of satisfaction (9.8 and 8.9, respectively), chewing
ability (9.9 and 8.4, respectively), and stability (9.7 and 8.0,
respectively). These results support the view that simplified fabrication techniques
can be as effective as conventional methods. The high satisfaction
scores may be attributed to the dentures meeting patient expectations,
particularly regarding improvements in appearance and masticatory function, which were
the most frequently reported expectations. According to Owen, documenting patient
expectations related to comfort, function, and aesthetics prior to treatment
is essential to ensure these factors are addressed during denture
fabrication. Furthermore, establishing a positive dentist–patient relationship is important, as
psychological factors are as significant as technical aspects in determining
the success of prosthetic treatment.
