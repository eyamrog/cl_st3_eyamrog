There are no reports that clearly demonstrate the application of
this body of labor laws in the sectors described, which
is expected given the high rate of informality in the
private sector and the generally weak functionality of the public
sector outside of Guayaquil and Quito. Nevertheless, it is highly
likely that these labor laws have been implemented within the
centralized public sector and, to some extent, in the industrial
sector; however, it is also probable that they have not
been applied in the majority of the informal sector.
