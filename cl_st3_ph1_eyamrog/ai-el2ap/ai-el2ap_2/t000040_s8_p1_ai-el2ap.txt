The mandibular canal (MC), situated within the mandible, transmits the
inferior alveolar nerve (IAN)—a branch of the mandibular nerve, which
is the third division of the trigeminal nerve—as well as
the inferior alveolar artery and vein [1,2]. The IAN provides
sensory innervation to the mandibular teeth and gingivae and gives
rise to two main branches: the mental nerve, which exits
the MC via the mental foramen to supply sensory innervation
to the chin and lower lip, and the mylohyoid nerve,
which supplies motor innervation to the mylohyoid muscle [2,3].
