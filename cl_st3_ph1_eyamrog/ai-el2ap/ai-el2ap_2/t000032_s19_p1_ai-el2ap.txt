The data presented correspond to comparisons of the mean values
for all participants considered as a single group, as no
statistically significant differences were observed in the presence of PMSL
factors according to players' field positions. Factors I (Humiliation/Anger), VI
(Repulsion), VIII (Surprise), IX (Hunger), and X (Disregard/Envy) exhibited consistently
low presence values (greater than 0.30) throughout the study.
