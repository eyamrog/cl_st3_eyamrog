Devide (2002, p. 78) argues that physical education (PE) plays
a significant role in educational interventions, emphasizing that teachers must
provide experiences that demonstrably enhance the quality of students’ lives.
Similarly, Gouvêa and Silva (2019) contend that PE should not
be restricted to promoting physical activity alone; rather, it should
also address, in a critical and reflective manner, issues related
to access to leisure facilities and basic health care, while
engaging with the broader benefits associated with these practices.
