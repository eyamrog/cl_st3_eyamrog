The significance attributed to city councilors in both the interviews
and the survey was notable, particularly in light of the
limited attention given by the existing literature to the relationships
between city councilors and actors outside the local context. In
the interviews, advisors highlighted the influential role of councilors, especially
in municipalities where a legislator does not have the support
of the mayor, indicating that councilors can play a key
role in efforts to gain or regain control of the
local executive branch.
