Depending on the type of event and the series to
which it belonged, Factors III (Hope) and XI (Receptivity) exhibited
distinct patterns of change. The mean presence value of Factor
III (Hope) decreased when the likelihood of team disqualification increased
or was confirmed. Nevertheless, this factor was observed in all
events throughout the study period. Previous research has indicated that
this PMSL factor is present during the early phases of
international competitions among elite volleyball players, although its values tend
to decline as the competition progresses (Di Bonif√°cio, 2013). Similarly,
Pujals and Vieira (2002) found that hope functioned as a
positive psychological factor among youth soccer players, influencing their on-field
performance.
