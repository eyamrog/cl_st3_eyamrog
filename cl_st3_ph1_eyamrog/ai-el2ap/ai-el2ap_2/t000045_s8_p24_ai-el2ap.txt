A central issue in principal-agent analyses is the extent to
which agents align with the objectives of principals, as well
as the mechanisms by which principals select and monitor brokers
to ensure compliance with their interests (Stokes et al., 2013;
Aspinall, 2014; Gingerich, 2020; Holland and Palmer-Rubin, 2015). Existing literature
often posits a misalignment between the interests of brokers and
those of politicians or parties, which introduces risks related to
optimization and return on investment for the principals (Stokes et
al., 2013). Consequently, it is insufficient for brokers to merely
possess local leadership status; they must also demonstrate effective voter
mobilization capabilities. Principals, in turn, require observable indicators to evaluate
and oversee broker performance. Commonly utilized indicators include the number
of votes brokers deliver (Szwarcberg, 2012; Gingerich, 2020), their attendance
at campaign events (Szwarcberg, 2012; Mu√±oz, 2014), and the size
of the networks they are able to establish (Stokes et
al., 2013).
