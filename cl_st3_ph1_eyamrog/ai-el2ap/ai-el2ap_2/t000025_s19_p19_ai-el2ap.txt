Ten studies (14.2%) recommended the use of topical antimicrobials, including
Metronidazole, Nanocrystalline Silver, and Silver Sulfadiazine, for the management of
malignant fungating wound (MFW)-related pain. The study designs included case
studies (40%), randomized clinical trials (20%), non-systematic reviews (10%), retrospective
cohort studies (10%), systematic reviews (10%), and surveys (10%). Six
of these studies (60%) reported the use of antimicrobials without
focusing primarily on pain management and did not specify the
method of administration or report outcomes related to pain.
