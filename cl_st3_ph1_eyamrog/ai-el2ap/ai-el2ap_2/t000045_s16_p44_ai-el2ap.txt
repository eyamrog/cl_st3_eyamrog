Only a minority of staff members were assigned to ground-level
positions, which contrasts with the findings of Carvalho (2003) regarding
national representatives. This difference may be attributable to the fact
that state assemblies are geographically closer to non-capital municipalities. Additionally,
because a significant proportion of local requests pertain to bureaucratic
procedures involving Executive branch agencies, it appears more efficient to
retain the majority of staff at the headquarters, where they
have greater access to these administrative structures.
