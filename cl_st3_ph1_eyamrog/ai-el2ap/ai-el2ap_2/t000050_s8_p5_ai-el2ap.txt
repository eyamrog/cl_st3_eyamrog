Health and disease conditions among Indigenous populations in Brazil remain
insufficiently documented. Significant gaps in government databases regarding morbidity, mortality,
and disease notification hinder the development of fundamental socio-demographic and
health indicators. Nevertheless, the limited available research on the public
health of Indigenous populations in Brazil indicates persistent marginalization and
vulnerability, as evidenced by reduced quality of life, limited access
to services, and poor health indicators [7].
