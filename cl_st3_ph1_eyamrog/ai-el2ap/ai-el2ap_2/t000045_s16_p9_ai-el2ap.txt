In both waves, community leaders were identified by legislators as
the most important factor contributing to their electoral success. This
finding contrasts with the results of the in-depth interviews, where
current and former elected officials, such as mayors and councilors,
were given significantly greater prominence compared to other types of
leaders. This discrepancy is likely attributable to differences in the
composition of the two samples: the survey included representatives with
diverse backgrounds and spatial voting patterns, whereas the interview sample
was limited to legislators whose electoral support was more geographically
concentrated.
