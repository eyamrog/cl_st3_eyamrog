The 1988 Constitution granted municipalities political and administrative autonomy, thereby
enhancing the significance of local leaders, particularly mayors. Nevertheless, the
majority of Brazilian municipalities continue to rely on financial transfers
from higher levels of government (Bremaeker, 2018). Persistent infrastructural deficiencies
lead mayors to establish and maintain relationships with members of
Congress in order to secure resources and benefits for their
municipalities, which in turn can contribute to their prospects for
electoral success.
