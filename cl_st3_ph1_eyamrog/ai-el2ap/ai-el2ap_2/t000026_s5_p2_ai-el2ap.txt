In addition, the university setting has been identified as a
significant context for the use of anxiolytic drugs and the
emergence of problematic consumption patterns (Vera et al., 2021). For
example, one study reported that 20% of senior health students
use anxiolytics on a daily basis, primarily in response to
anxiety related to examinations, challenges in managing academic responsibilities, and
the demands of curricular or extracurricular internship activities (Fond et
al., 2019).
