The government of President Arturo Alessandri (1932–1938), through decree no.
1009 issued on October 11, 1935, established a commission to
examine the implementation of the minimum wage and to recommend
legal measures aimed at significantly improving workers' incomes via the
introduction of a family wage (Yáñez 2019:12). The commission proposed
the adoption of a living and family wage differentiated by
region, designed to cover the basic needs of a household
for an entire year, with particular emphasis on ensuring a
daily caloric intake of 3,000 calories per worker. Based on
these criteria, the commission recommended a wage of 10.50 pesos
in Zone I and 8.03 pesos in Zone V.
