The analysis of these brokerage relationships provides limited evidence to
support the principal-agent modelâ€™s key assumption of informational asymmetry favoring
the agent. While several studies on brokers posit that brokers
possess insider information relative to principals and leverage this informational
advantage to secure additional resources (Stokes et al., 2013; Camp,
Dixit, and Stokes, 2014; Keefer and Vlaicu, 2007; Novaes, 2018),
the findings presented here do not substantiate this premise.
