Encouraging students to gesture while engaging with a problem can
facilitate the activation of implicit ideas related to that problem,
which may subsequently increase their receptiveness to new instructional input
(Goldin-Meadow, 2017). Thus, gestures serve not only as indicators of
cognitive processes but also as mechanisms that can influence and
modify thinking in both listeners and speakers. As such, gesture
represents a valuable tool for students, teachers, and researchers to
investigate and gain insights into cognitive processes.
