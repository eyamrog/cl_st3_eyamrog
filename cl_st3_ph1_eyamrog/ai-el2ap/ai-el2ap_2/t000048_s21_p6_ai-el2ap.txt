The specimens from Rio de Janeiro (J.M.A. Braga 7416 and
F.A. Silva 103) were documented as flowering in February and
fruiting from February to March, which corresponds with the phenological
observations recorded in the present study area. These data suggest
that the reproductive processes of this species may be more
pronounced during the hottest period of the year.
