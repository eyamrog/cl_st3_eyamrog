As noted in the previous section, there is a scarcity
of research on didactic materials specifically designed for Brazilian blind
students, particularly in the context of English as an Additional
Language (EAL), as none of the reviewed articles addressed this
topic. This lack of research is not unique to the
field of English language education; similar challenges were identified in
other disciplines, such as Physics (Ferreira & Dickman, 2015) and
Music (Oliveira & Reily, 2014), highlighting a broader need for
further investigation. These findings suggest a significant research gap across
multiple educational fields and underscore the importance of collaborating with
colleagues and special educators to develop and adapt instructional materials
for blind students in all subject areas.
