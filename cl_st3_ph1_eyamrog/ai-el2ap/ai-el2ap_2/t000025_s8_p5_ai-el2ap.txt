The current literature on topical interventions for the management of
malignant fungating wounds (MFWs) demonstrates inconsistency, with various topical agents
such as opioids, anti-inflammatory drugs, anesthetics, and non-adherent dressings being
utilized, each exhibiting different analgesic properties (EONS, 2015). Topical pain
management is often favored over systemic administration due to the
latterâ€™s association with significant adverse effects. Furthermore, the effectiveness of
systemic analgesics in controlling MFW-related pain may be compromised by
unpredictable bioavailability, which can result from altered local circulation secondary
to malignant infiltration (LeBon et al., 2009).
