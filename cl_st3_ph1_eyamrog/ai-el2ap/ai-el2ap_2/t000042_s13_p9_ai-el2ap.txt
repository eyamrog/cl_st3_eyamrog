Bolsonaro and Doria initiated vaccination programs in March 2021. In
response to criticism, Bolsonaro replaced Pazuello with Marcelo Queiroga, a
private-sector physician who pledged to accelerate vaccination efforts but did
not actively promote mask usage and supported both Bolsonaro’s public
statements and his attempts to challenge vaccination initiatives. Despite these
changes, Queiroga and Bolsonaro were unable to address ongoing allegations
regarding necropolitical policies and corruption related to vaccine procurement. Additionally,
an article in the British Medical Journal accused the government
of “crimes against humanity” due to what it described as
the “massive and systematic use of pressure to induce the
public to behave a certain way, according to a preconceived
plan.”
