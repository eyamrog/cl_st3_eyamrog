Among the interviewees, the selection of brokers appears to be
guided primarily by regional considerations and often occurs through various
informal channels. For instance, alliances may be initiated by mayors
who proactively contact legislators to request support and propose partnerships.
This is particularly common among so-called “orphan mayors,” who lack
legislative backing either because of a severed relationship or because
their preferred candidate was not elected. Mayors from the same
region or neighboring municipalities frequently communicate with one another; a
mayor may recommend a legislator to a colleague, or an
orphan mayor may seek advice from a neighboring mayor. Several
interviewees indicated that when approached by a new mayor, they
gather information about the individual, sometimes consulting former allies, highlighting
the significance of reputation in alliance formation and suggesting the
presence of ex-ante screening mechanisms at the outset of these
relationships.
