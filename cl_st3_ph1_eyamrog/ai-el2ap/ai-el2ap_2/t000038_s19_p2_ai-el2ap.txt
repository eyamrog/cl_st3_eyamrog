The adequacy of the polychoric correlation matrix was supported by
Bartlett's test of sphericity (χ² = 21,116.6, df = 276,
p < 0.00001) and a Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of 0.939,
indicating that the correlation matrix was suitable for factor analysis.
Parallel analysis identified two factors as the most representative structure
for the data (see Table 1).
