Subsequently, the first "Dentures in One Day/DSEI Bahia" campaign was
conducted over a five-day period. During this time, dentures were
fabricated in a clinical setting established at the Cultural Center,
where five pairs of dentists from DSEI Bahia operated using
portable equipment and school tables. Laboratory procedures were carried out
by two dental prosthesis technicians working in an adjacent mini
laboratory. The team also included three indigenous oral health assistants,
who were responsible for organizing the workspace and sterilizing instruments.
