In the category of “Body practices,” the influence of traditional
physical education is evident. This category conceptualizes health as being
attained through pedagogical practices centered on physical exercise, whether through
systematic or recreational sports activities, including games, as previously noted
by Devide (1996). This discourse, which is justified by the
emphasis on the development of biological variables and motor learning,
often establishes, sometimes implicitly, a connection between physical fitness and
the attainment of a health standard. This perspective has historically
guided, and continues to inform, the pedagogical practices of physical
education teachers (Bracht, 2013; Oliveira, Martins, & Bracht, 2015a).
