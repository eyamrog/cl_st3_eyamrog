Stieff, Lira, and Scopelitis (2016) conducted two studies to investigate
the role of gestures in supporting spatial thinking during STEM
instruction. In the first study, they compared the effectiveness of
observing and reproducing gestures with reading a text. In the
second study, they compared the use of gestures with an
instructional approach that involved manipulating concrete models without the use
of gestures. The findings demonstrated that the incorporation of gestures
significantly enhanced students' spatial thinking and performance in STEM subjects
compared to instructional methods that did not include gestures.
