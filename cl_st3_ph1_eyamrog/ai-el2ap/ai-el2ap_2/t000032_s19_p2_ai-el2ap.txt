A comparison of the presence values for each Factor within
the same Series across different Events indicated significant changes in
mood states over time (Figure 1). Temporal patterns were observed
for Factors II (Fatigue), VII (Interest), and XII (Serenity). For
Factor II (Fatigue), presence values were significantly higher at TR-PRE
compared to MATCH (p=0.001), and MATCH values were significantly lower
than TR-POST values (p=0.002). Regarding Factor VII (Interest), TR-PRE values
were significantly higher than TR-POST values (p=0.008), and MATCH values
were also significantly higher than TR-POST values (p=0.000). For Factor
XII (Serenity), TR-PRE values were higher than TR-POST values in
Series 1 (p=0.023) and Series 3 (p=0.023), but lower than
TR-POST values in Series 2 (p=0.034). Overall, TR-PRE values were
higher for Factor II (Fatigue) compared to MATCH values, while
MATCH values were higher for Factors VII (Interest) and XII
(Serenity) compared to TR-POST values; additionally, TR-POST values for Factor
II (Fatigue) were higher than MATCH values.
