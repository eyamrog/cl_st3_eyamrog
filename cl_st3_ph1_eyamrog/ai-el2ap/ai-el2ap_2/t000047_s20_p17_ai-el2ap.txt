There are two primary instances in this communication that illustrate
the use of proxemics. The first occurs when Social Actor
2 enters the room to respond to Social Actor 1’s
statement in the restroom. Initially, there is a personal distance
between the two individuals, but this distance is reduced to
an intimate level when Social Actor 2 approaches and places
a lab coat on Social Actor 1. The second instance
takes place in a different scene, where Social Actor 1
joins Social Actor 2 to collaboratively promote Oral-B, both using
their right hands. In this scenario, the initial personal distance
is similarly reduced as Social Actor 1 moves closer, ultimately
placing his hand on Social Actor 2’s shoulder, thereby facilitating
a unified approach to marketing Oral-B.
