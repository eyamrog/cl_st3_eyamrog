This study employed a cross-sectional web-based survey with a descriptive
and correlational design. To ensure methodological rigor, the study adhered
to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology
(STROBE) guidelines (Cevallos et al., 2014). The research was conducted
across three geographic regions of Brazil: Northeast, Southeast, and South.
Data were collected online over a 30-day period, from September
15 to October 14, 2021. The sample comprised undergraduate university
students enrolled in health-related programs.
