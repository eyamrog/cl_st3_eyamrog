By late 2020, many Brazilian scientists anticipated that vaccines would
play a critical role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Two
vaccines gained prominence in Brazil: CoronaVac, produced in China in
collaboration with the Butantan Institute in São Paulo, and AstraZeneca,
developed in partnership with Fiocruz, a federal institution based in
Rio de Janeiro. President Bolsonaro initially rejected vaccines, particularly CoronaVac,
which he associated with the São Paulo state government and
its governor, João Doria. Subsequently, Bolsonaro adopted an ambivalent stance
and publicly stated that he had not been vaccinated. Although
his administration participated in the COVAX Facility—an initiative led by
the World Health Organization to facilitate vaccine access for developing
countries—Bolsonaro opposed a joint proposal by India and South Africa
at the World Trade Organization to waive patent protections for
COVID-19 vaccines.
