Uliana (2013) contributes to the field by proposing a pedagogical
kit designed for use with adapted materials. The author identifies
several key characteristics that should be considered when developing such
materials: they should be inexpensive (using items such as magnets,
metal plates, EVE, paper, glue, and polystyrene), lightweight and compact
for ease of transport, and simple to assemble and disassemble
to allow for the creation of various figures and graphical
representations. Drawing on previous research, Uliana (2013, p. 598) asserts
that access to concrete tactile materials enables blind students to
abstract information at a level comparable to that of sighted
students. Furthermore, the author notes that it is not necessary
to implement major changes in teaching methods; rather, minor adaptations
are sufficient to address the needs of blind students.
