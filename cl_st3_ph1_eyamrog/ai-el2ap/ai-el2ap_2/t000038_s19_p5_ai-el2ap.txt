The Measure of Sampling Adequacy (MSA) suggested the removal of
item 21 ("Recently, I rarely talk to my family") due
to its low MSA value (0.55089) (Lorenzo and Ferrando, 2021).
However, Pratt's relative importance indicator, which assesses the extent to
which each factor accounts for the variance in the item,
indicated that item 21 is significant for the first factor.
Consequently, the decision was made to retain the item.
