On November 26, 1934, the Senate finalized the definitive draft
of the Minimum Wage Law. These findings suggest that the
legislative process for establishing minimum wage regulations was interrupted. No
significant progress occurred between 1934 and 1935 toward the law’s
enactment. As noted by Creamer (2018: 36), “the fact that
wage fixes responded to agreements between the parties until 1936
reflected a legal vacuum linked to the weak capacity to
elaborate wage legislation for the industrial sector during the politically
unstable period from 1931 to 1935.”
