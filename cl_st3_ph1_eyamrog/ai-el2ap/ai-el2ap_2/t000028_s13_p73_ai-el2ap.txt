For activity E, the EAL teacher may present the sounds
produced by various animals using digital audio resources, such as
recordings from YouTube, and ask students to identify the corresponding
animal in English. This activity can be conducted in groups,
pairs, or with the entire class, and is designed to
develop students' listening and speaking skills.
