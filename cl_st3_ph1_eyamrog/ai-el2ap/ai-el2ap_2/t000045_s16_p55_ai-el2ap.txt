Given the high volume of requests received from municipalities, the
offices establish priorities by balancing two main criteria: maximizing the
number of local partners who benefit and ensuring that the
allocated resources are both tangible for the population and sufficient
to support public works. The interviews indicate that the most
important consideration is to ensure that the benefits have significant
impact and visibility, which necessitates allocating a greater volume of
resources to larger cities. According to one interviewee, distributing resources
in larger cities can result in the benefits being too
dispersed, while another interviewee noted that allocating insufficient resources to
a large city may lead to criticism.
