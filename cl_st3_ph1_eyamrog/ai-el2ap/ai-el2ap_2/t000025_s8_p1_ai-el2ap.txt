According to the Globocan 2020 report, one in five individuals
is expected to develop cancer during their lifetime. The report
estimated that, at the time of publication, 19.3 million people
worldwide were living with cancer, and 10 million had died
from the disease (Sung et al., 2021). Recent advancements in
cancer diagnosis and treatment have contributed to increased survival rates
(Sung et al., 2021; Tsichlakidou et al., 2019), which has
resulted in a growing population of cancer survivors who are
at risk for chronic complications related to both disease progression
and treatment. These complications include the development of malignant fungating
wounds (MFWs) (Hoshi et al., 2019; Tilley et al., 2020).
