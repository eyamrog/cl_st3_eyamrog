Although this research primarily employs a qualitative approach, it was
also necessary to incorporate quantitative procedures to support the analysis
with quantified data, which were organized in tables and graphs
(Silva, 2016; Santade, 2014). According to Santade (2014), quantitative research
involves the organization of numerical information through statistical methods, whereas
qualitative research focuses on a structured and interpretative analysis of
information. The integration of these approaches enhances the accuracy of
data description and analysis, thereby contributing to reliable and valid
results and conclusions (Santade, 2014, p. 102). The quantitative approach
facilitated both the collection and quantification of data during the
theoretical phase (such as the selection of articles for the
literature review) and the practical phase (such as the compilation
of data from sixth grade English textbooks used in public
schools in Santa Maria, RS, in 2021). Conversely, the qualitative
approach was essential for the analysis and interpretation of these
data, which form the basis for the proposed adaptation.
