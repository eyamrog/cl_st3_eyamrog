Consistent with previous studies conducted in Brazil and the comparative
literature, our findings indicate that cooperation between state representatives and
local brokers is mutually beneficial, despite the associated risks. We
argue that these risks should not be conceptualized as dilemmas
characteristic of principal-agent models. Our analysis does not support the
existence of an inherent conflict of objectives between participants, particularly
in cases involving brokers who currently hold or have previously
held elective office. Furthermore, while information asymmetry exists between participants,
it does not systematically advantage agents or brokers. In the
absence of empirical support for the core assumptions of principal-agent
theories, we emphasize the limitations of these frameworks in describing
and analyzing the relationships examined in this study. Therefore, we
suggest that principal-agent theories should not serve as the primary
analytical framework for understanding these interactions. Instead, they may be
useful as heuristic tools if applied with greater flexibility, recognizing
that actors engage in multiple, overlapping relationships across various levels
and timeframes, rather than as fixed “superior-subordinate dyads” (Waterman and
Meier, 1998). It is also essential to account for contextual
factors that influence levels of uncertainty, informational asymmetry, interdependence, and
the alignment of interests and objectives. Consequently, elements often treated
as universal assumptions should instead be regarded as variables (Waterman
and Meier, 1998). This approach acknowledges that the dynamics of
these relationships may vary according to factors such as municipality
size, proximity to elections, degree of electoral competition, levels of
party system institutionalization, and the potential scale of brokerage networks,
among others.
