The insects were preserved in microtubes containing 70% ethanol and
subsequently separated from other collected specimens either in the field
or under a dissecting microscope in the laboratory. Specimens were
cleared and mounted on slides for species identification, following the
identification key provided by Galati (2003) [2]. A subsample of
the identified insects will be deposited in the Coleção de
Flebotomíneos at the Instituto René Rachou/FIOCRUZ-Minas (COLFLEB/FIOCRUZ).
