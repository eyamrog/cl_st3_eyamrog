However, the visibility of the mandibular canal decreases when its
borders become indistinct due to low bone density or a
lack of perpendicular alignment between the canal and the primary
X-ray beam [27]. Additionally, this technique is limited by lower
resolution, increased distortion, and a higher risk of producing phantom
images [28].
