Indigenous Brazilians comprise diverse groups who have inhabited the region
prior to Portuguese colonization. At the time of European arrival,
the indigenous population was estimated at approximately five million individuals;
however, this number has declined significantly over subsequent centuries, primarily
due to diseases introduced by Europeans and conflicts with colonizers.
According to the 2010 census conducted by the Brazilian Institute
of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), there were 896,900 indigenous people
in Brazil, representing 305 distinct ethnic groups and speaking 274
different languages.
