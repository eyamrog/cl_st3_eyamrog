In this context, the Dentures in One Day Technique was
developed based on four fundamental principles. The first principle involves
the use of prefabricated, flexible dental arches with adjustable teeth
(patent PI0602107-7 B1). In this approach, artificial teeth are pre-assembled
on a flexible support base composed of an acrylic elastomeric
material that permits three-dimensional movement. The flexibility of the elastomer
enables the base to be adapted to the patient's anatomical
features, allowing for the simultaneous assembly of both upper and
lower teeth. Additionally, the base material facilitates individual adjustment of
tooth positions to address aesthetic, phonetic, or occlusal concerns as
needed. The bases of the prefabricated dental arches are constructed
from a temporary material, which is entirely removed during the
acrylization process and replaced with heat-activated acrylic resin (HAAR) based
on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA).
