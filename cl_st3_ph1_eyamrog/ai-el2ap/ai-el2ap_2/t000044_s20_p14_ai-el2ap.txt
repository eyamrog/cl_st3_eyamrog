When students discuss topics covered in class with others, they
frequently use gestures to clarify and communicate their ideas and
concepts. Flood et al. (2014) describe this behavior as a
publicly observable, spatially dynamic mode of expression, in which gestures
and bodily movements serve as effective resources for collectively conceptualizing
the submicroscopic, three-dimensional, and dynamic phenomena characteristic of chemistry.
