Currently, mayors and councilors often seek resources for their municipalities
through a process that involves negotiation. They typically commit to
supporting a legislator only when the legislator is able to
provide such resources. In our selection process, we are careful
to avoid individuals who exhibit this behavior, as it does
not contribute to establishing long-term relationships. The legislator in question
is characterized by an ability to bring together a diverse
group of individuals, including party members, party sympathizers, and even
personal acquaintances (Advisor 1).
