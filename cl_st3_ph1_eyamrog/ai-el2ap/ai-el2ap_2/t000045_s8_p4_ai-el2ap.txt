In addition, our analysis identifies a distinct category of brokers
that has received limited attention in recent literature. Few comparative
studies have examined the role of local elective officeholders as
brokers (Stokes et al., 2013; Camp, 2015) or analyzed their
specific characteristics in detail. Most existing research tends to focus
on party activists (Stokes et al., 2013), individuals motivated by
political, ethnic, or religious affiliations (Aspinall, 2014), community leaders with
varying degrees of party association (Zarazaga, 2014; Holland & Palmer-Rubin,
2015), and independent brokers who are engaged exclusively during election
periods (Mu√±oz, 2014).
