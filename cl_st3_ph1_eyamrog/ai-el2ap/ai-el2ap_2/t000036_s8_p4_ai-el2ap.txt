In this economic and political context, the research aims to
analyze key variables related to the working conditions of workers
in Ecuador during the 1930s. Specifically, the study will examine
the relationship between purchasing power and wages across three distinct
groups: (1) workers who relied on barter and community-based subsistence
systems; (2) salaried agricultural workers and small business employees who
received daily wages supplemented by in-kind compensation; and (3) workers
employed in the centralized public sector and the industrial sector.
