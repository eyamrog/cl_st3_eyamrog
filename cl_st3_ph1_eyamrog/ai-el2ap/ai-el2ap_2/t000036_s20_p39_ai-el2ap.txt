The countries analyzed in this study experienced distinct local and
national political contexts; however, all implemented minimum wage policies aimed
at ensuring workers receive an income sufficient for basic subsistence.
In developing these policies, factors such as the status of
public sector workers, regional disparities, transportation challenges in specific areas,
labor demand in the private sector, and employersâ€™ capacity to
pay were considered. Consequently, various countries established different forms of
minimum wages based on geographic location, exchange rates, and occupational
categories. During the 1930s, Latin America experienced a significant increase
in the adoption of minimum wage regulations, either through legislative
measures or constitutional amendments. The constitutions of Brazil, Mexico, Uruguay,
and Peru explicitly recognized the necessity of establishing consistent minimum
wages (Owen 1938), while other countries in the region adopted
similar measures over time in accordance with their respective political
circumstances.
