Scholz expresses moral indignation regarding the violation of international law,
drawing an analogy to the Second World War and incorporating
a personal perspective. According to Pörksen (2003, p. 35), speech
writers recommend beginning a speech by stating one’s personal attitudes,
feelings, and values, as this can enhance the credibility of
the address. The discourse of moral indignation is evident through
various instances of judgement by social sanction, such as the
phrases “kaltblütig einen Angriffskrieg vom Zaun gebrochen” (‘started a war
of aggression in cold blood’), “menschenverachtend” (‘inhumane’), and “die ganze
Skrupellosigkeit Putins” (‘Putin’s complete ruthlessness’). Personal involvement is further conveyed
through expressions of affect, including “die schrecklichen Bilder” (‘the horrible
images’), “himmelschreiende Ungerechtigkeit” (‘appalling injustice’), and “furchtbaren Nachrichten” (‘terrible news’).
The personal perspective is also apparent in the emotive framing
of the discourse on international law, as seen in the
phrase “infamer Völkerrechtsbruch” (‘malicious breach of international law’), which implicitly
contrasts with the possibility of less severe breaches, and in
the characterization of the Russian veto—an established right of permanent
members of the UN Security Council—as a “Notbremse” (‘emergency brake’),
accompanied by the evaluative statement “Was für eine Schande!” (‘What
a disgrace!’).
