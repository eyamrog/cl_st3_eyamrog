Another significant development was the establishment of a relative minimum
wage. The absence of a legally defined minimum wage represented
a regulatory gap that required prompt attention. Following extensive research,
it was determined that the minimum wage should be set
at one sucre per day in the mountainous regions and
two sucres per day in the coastal areas (Guerrero 1937:22-23).
