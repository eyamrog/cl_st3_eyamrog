As the first volume in the “Way to English” collection,
the textbook addresses fundamental aspects of the English language by
presenting activities in both English and Portuguese, with the language
of instruction determined by the level of difficulty—less complex activities
are provided in English, while more complex ones are in
Portuguese. The book begins with a brief overview highlighting the
significance and prevalence of the English language in everyday life,
as well as an explanation of the objectives of all
four volumes in the series. This is followed by a
summary of the eight units included in the textbook, outlining
their respective sections and content. The subsequent section, titled “Tips
into Practice,” offers activities focused on reading and learning strategies
designed to enhance students’ confidence in completing exercises throughout the
textbook. Additionally, the textbook includes two pages of classroom sentences
in English intended for use by both students and teachers.
