For most legislators, obtaining the support of the mayor is
highly significant. For example, if one assumes the role of
mayor in a given municipality and a legislator visits independently
to request votes, the legislator is likely to be unfamiliar
to the local population. Residents, particularly those from rural areas,
tend to place their trust in mayors, councilors, and other
local leaders who provide information about the legislator (Chief of
Staff 2).
