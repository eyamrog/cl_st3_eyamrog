The research planning and the educational strategies implemented by the
adult in this study are informed by John Dewey’s (1933,
1938) theoretical framework on the inquiry process, Vygotsky’s (1930, 1934)
concept of the zone of proximal development, and Bruner’s notion
of scaffolding. Additionally, the work of Susan Isaacs (1930, 1933)
was particularly relevant, as her experience at Malting House provided
a pedagogical interpretation of Dewey’s theory and psychoanalytic perspectives, thereby
contributing to the theoretical foundation of this research.
