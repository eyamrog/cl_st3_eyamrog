There are several challenges that EAL teachers may encounter when
working with blind students, including a lack of motivation or
discouragement among students, limited familiarity with Braille and other accessible
materials on the part of either the student or the
teacher, and potential social exclusion of blind students by their
peers (Benwell, 2022). To address these challenges, it is important
for teachers to exercise patience and foster an inclusive classroom
environment in which all students feel comfortable participating and making
mistakes. It is essential to recognize that blind students are,
above all, students who should receive equitable treatment alongside their
sighted peers, even though their learning methods may differ.
