HLMA 1, as previously noted, encompasses LLMA ranging from O-BT
1 to O-BT 18, which correspond to the image transcripts
of Oral-B. In a similar manner, the researcher systematically analyzes

presenting the structural depiction of the Oral-B Dental Institute, accompanied
by rhythmic musical notes. The visual representation of the building
suggests a theme-rheme configuration (Oâ€™Toole, 2011), as the section labeled
"Oral-B Dental Institute" is depicted as lower in height and
smaller in size compared to the adjacent building, which appears
to be a more visually prominent and modern structure.
