According to Dimitrova, Özçalışkan, and Adamson (2017), gestural understanding remains
insufficiently studied, particularly in children with autism spectrum disorder who
experience difficulties in gesture production. Building on the work of
McNeill (2005), these researchers investigated children aged 2 to 4
years to analyze the types of gestures produced and the
combinations of gesture and speech. Their findings indicate that children
with autism spectrum disorder demonstrate greater understanding of deictic gestures
and gesture-speech combinations that reinforce meaning, compared to iconic or
conventional gestures and supplementary combinations. This pattern appears consistent across
different ages within the studied population.
