This scoping review of the literature on topical therapies for
malignant fungating wound (MFW)-related pain management identified 70 studies encompassing
20 topical therapies. These therapies were categorized as dressings (non-adherent
dressings, hydrogels, absorbent dressings, and anti-inflammatory dressings), analgesic drugs (topical
opioids, topical anesthetics, and medical cannabis), antimicrobial substances (antimicrobials, honey,
and antiseptics), cryotherapy, and negative pressure wound therapy. For periwound
skin interventions, the review identified zinc oxide (ointment and cream),
silicone (adhesive remover), dimethicone, petrolatum, acrylate, cyanoacrylate, hydrocolloid (plate and
powder), and a vitamin-rich ointment (vitamins A and D). Technical
considerations for MFW pain management included irrigating with a warm
solution, careful application and removal of dressings, avoidance of debridement,
maintenance of a moist wound environment, cleaning with soap of
appropriate pH, reducing the frequency of dressing changes, and administering
systemic analgesia prior to dressing changes. Despite the range of
interventions identified, there is a lack of studies providing detailed
descriptions of product application and robust evidence regarding their effectiveness,
limiting the ability to inform evidence-based practice.
