The purchasing power of the economically active population also differed
according to labor group. For the first group, further information
is unavailable because this population participated in an exchange and
commercialization system based on barter rather than monetary transactions. The
lack of primary data, combined with the challenges of quantifying
value in a barter-based system rather than in monetary terms,
makes it impossible to determine precise amounts for purchasing power
in this context.
