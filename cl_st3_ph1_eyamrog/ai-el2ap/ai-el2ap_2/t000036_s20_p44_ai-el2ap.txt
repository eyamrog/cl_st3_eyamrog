Within the textile industry, wage differentiation exists between workers producing
wool raincoats and those producing shorts, with the former receiving
a minimum wage of 11 pesos and the latter a
minimum of 12 pesos. The masons' strike of 1936 (Owen
1938) prompted the authorities to issue the resolution of March
24, which established formal minimum wages for various occupational categories:
6.40 pesos for foremen, 5.2 pesos for foremenâ€™s assistants, and
4.5 pesos for laborers.
