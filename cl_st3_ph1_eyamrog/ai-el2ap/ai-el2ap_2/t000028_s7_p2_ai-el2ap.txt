To facilitate comprehension among sighted students, teachers of English as
an Additional Language (EAL) commonly employ visual materials, including pictures,
photographs, videos, flashcards, maps, and posters. While these resources serve
as realia and support language acquisition, they require adaptation for
use with students who are blind or have visual impairments.
For these learners, instructional materials must be provided in formats
that are accessible through alternative sensory modalities, such as tactile
or auditory forms, allowing engagement with the content via touch
or hearing (RESOURCES FOR TEACHING ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE
TO LEARNERS WITH BLINDNESS OR VISUAL IMPAIRMENT, 2022).
