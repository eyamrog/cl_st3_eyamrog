Simultaneously, Social Actor 2 states, "You clean your teeth strong
and healthy," to which Social Actor 1 responds, "And gives
your mouth long-lasting fresh breath." The use of the paratactic
conjunction "And" is significant, particularly when contrasted with the earlier-discussed
use of "But." While Social Actor 2 previously employed "But"
to counter Social Actor 1â€™s statement, in this instance, Social
Actor 1 uses "And" to affirm and extend the claim,
suggesting that Oral-B not only strengthens and cleans teeth but
also provides long-lasting fresh breath. This dual emphasis on dental
health and oral freshness positions the product as addressing both
needs simultaneously, thereby supporting its characterization as a "2-IN-1" toothpaste.
