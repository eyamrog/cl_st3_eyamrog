Scholz begins his speech by asserting that the Russian invasion
of Ukraine represents a “Zeitenwende” in European history, a term
officially translated as ‘watershed’. In this article, this will be
referred to as the watershed discourse. This discourse operates at
the level of the proximal not-yet-spoken, serving as the Scholz
government’s rationale for implementing a range of potentially controversial policies,
based on the argument that a new era necessitates new
responses. The discourse is explicitly linked to Russian actions through
Scholz’s characterization of the purported turning point (example 1), which
he introduces with the contractive proclaim “im Kern geht es
um,” indicating his claim to a fundamental understanding of the
situation.
