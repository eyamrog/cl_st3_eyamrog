In this second group, primary data on pensions can be
incorporated. Presidential decrees from 1928 specified monthly pensions for primary
teachers ranging from 66 to 143 sucres, corresponding to the
average salary received over the preceding five years. Additionally, records
from Hacienda Tungurahua in 1928 indicate that doormen and stamp
sellers received wages of 60 sucres per month (Official Gazette
No. 604, 1928). These figures contribute to a more comprehensive
understanding of the income levels among salaried workers and agricultural
laborers during this period.
