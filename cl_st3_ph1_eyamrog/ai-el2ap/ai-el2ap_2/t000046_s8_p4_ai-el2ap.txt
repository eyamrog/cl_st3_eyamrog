The adoption of an expanded concept of health, introduced in
the Brazilian context by the VIII National Health Conference (BRASIL,
1986), has contributed to new perspectives in the field. According
to this concept, health is understood as a result of
individuals’ living conditions, with determinants including food, housing, income, environment,
work, transportation, employment, leisure, freedom, access to and ownership of
land, and access to health services. As noted by Palma,
Estevão, and Bagrichevsky (2003), health is conceptualized as the outcome
of an individual's interaction with society.
