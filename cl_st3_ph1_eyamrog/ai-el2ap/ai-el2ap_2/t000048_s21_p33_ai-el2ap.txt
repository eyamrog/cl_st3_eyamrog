Another characteristic observed is that the specimens from NÃºcleo Curucutu
exhibit a more compact and globular inflorescence, whereas those from
other locations display a more lax inflorescence, as seen in
the specimens from Bahia (L.A. Mattos Silva 3673), Rio de
Janeiro (R. Mello-Silva 1230), and Santa Catarina (Reitz & Klein
4027).
