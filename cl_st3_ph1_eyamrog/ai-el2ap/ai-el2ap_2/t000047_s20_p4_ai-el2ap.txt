The context of this communication is situated within the Oral-B
Dental Institute, which may explain the decision to introduce the
institute at the outset. The setting reinforces this institutional focus,
and the introduction of Social Actor 2 further supports this
context. Social Actor 2 intervenes in the discussion by stating,
"But that breath feeling just doesn’t last." The use of
the paratactic conjunction "But" (Thompson, 2014) serves to directly contradict
the preceding statement made by Social Actor 1. This lexical
choice signals to the audience that, despite regular tooth brushing,
there remains an unmet need—specifically, the persistence of fresh breath.
According to Social Actor 2, the transient nature of the
"breath feeling" is a significant issue. At this stage in
the communication, the enduring fresh breath provided by Oral-B toothpaste
is positioned as its primary selling point. This argument implicitly
critiques competing toothpaste brands for failing to deliver a long-lasting
fresh breath experience. The communication later specifies that Oral-B maintains
a fresh breath sensation in users’ mouths for up to
14 hours, as indicated in segments O-BT24 to O-BT27.
