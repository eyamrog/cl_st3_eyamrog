This perspective is also reflected in the BNCC, which states
that students should "take advantage of body practices autonomously to
enhance involvement in leisure contexts, expand sociability networks and health
promotion" (BRASIL, 2017, p. 223). However, it is important to
move beyond a purely behavioral interpretation focused on individual lifestyle
changes and adopt a socio-environmental approach. According to Westphal (2013),
this approach is characterized by collective strategies aimed at population
empowerment, the promotion of healthy environments, and the development of
relevant skills, knowledge, and attitudes.
