5. Detection of the problem. This category closely resembles the
previous one, as it also aligns with Deweyâ€™s investigative process.
The distinguishing feature of behaviors in this category is that
children, during their exploration of available materials, encounter a problem
that presents an obstacle or dilemma. This situation is characterized
by the child experiencing frustration due to their inquiry being
impeded by a problem arising from external circumstances. A situation

that causes difficulty and attempts to address it. An example
is provided below.
