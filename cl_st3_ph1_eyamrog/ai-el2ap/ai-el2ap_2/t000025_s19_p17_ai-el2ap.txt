Only one case study (1.4%) (Maida, 2017) investigated the use
of medicinal cannabis, administered both as a topical and vaporized
oil, as part of the pain management strategy for malignant
fungating wounds (MFW). The case involved a 44-year-old male patient
with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, which resulted
in an MFW on the right hemiface. The patient initially
reported severe pain, with scores ranging from 9 to 10
out of 10, and was receiving intravenous analgesia. Following the
administration of vaporized medicinal cannabis every 2 to 4 hours,
and the application of 1â€“2 ml of cannabis oil to
the wound both externally and intra-orally prior to dressing changes,
the patient reported a reduction in pain scores to 3
or 4. This improvement facilitated adjustments to the analgesic regimen.
This case represents the first report suggesting the potential efficacy
of topical medicinal cannabis in the management of MFW-related pain.
