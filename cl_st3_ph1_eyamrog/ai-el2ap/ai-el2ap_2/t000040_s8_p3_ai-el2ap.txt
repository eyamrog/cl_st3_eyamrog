In a study examining the vertical position of the inferior
alveolar nerve (IAN) in 39 edentulous human cadaveric mandibles, Kieser
et al. reported that the IAN was located in the
superior part of the mandibular body in 30.7% of cases
(12 out of 39), while in 69.2% of cases (27
out of 39), the IAN was situated at or below
the midpoint, closer to the inferior border of the mandible
[8].
