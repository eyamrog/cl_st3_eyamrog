To advance the taxonomic study of Zingiberales in the Núcleo
Curucutu, this research involved the collection, identification, and description of
species, as well as the preparation of an identification key,
illustrations, and the compilation of data on the geographic and
phenological distribution of the recorded species. These activities contribute to
the understanding of the local flora, as well as to
the broader knowledge of the flora of the State of
São Paulo and the Atlantic Forest.
