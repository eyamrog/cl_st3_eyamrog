Of the participants, 39.9% reported using anxiolytic drugs, while 60.1%
did not. Table 2 presents the results of a correlation
analysis examining the relationships among age, duration of use, amount
of anxiolytic medication, and levels of state and trait anxiety.
No statistically significant associations were identified between age, duration, or
amount of anxiolytic medication and state anxiety. Similarly, no significant
relationships were found between duration or amount of anxiolytic medication
and trait anxiety. However, a weak but statistically significant negative
correlation was observed between age and trait anxiety (r =
-0.114, p = 0.007).
