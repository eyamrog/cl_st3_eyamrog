Qualitative studies were included if they employed a qualitative theoretical
and methodological framework. Quantitative studies were included if they utilized
experimental designs (controlled trials with or without randomization, quasi-experimental studies,
or before-and-after studies) or observational designs (descriptive, cohort, cross-sectional, case
reports, and case series). Systematic reviews, non-systematic reviews, meta-analyses, meta-syntheses,
and clinical practice guidelines were also considered. Additionally, unpublished studies
(gray literature) in English, Portuguese, and Spanish, regardless of publication
date, were included.
