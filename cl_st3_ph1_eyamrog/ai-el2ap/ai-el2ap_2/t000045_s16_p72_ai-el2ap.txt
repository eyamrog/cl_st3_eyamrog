Communication among office staff constitutes a significant source of information
for state representatives. For instance, this communication enables advisors to
determine whether an allied or soliciting mayor has also been
seeking assistance and offering electoral support in other offices. Additionally,
legislators rely on their local networks and visits to municipalities
to assess the extent of mayorsâ€™ efforts in mobilizing voters
during election campaigns. Invitations from mayors to attend public works
inaugurations and other events further serve as indicators of their
commitment to promoting the representative within their municipality. Consequently, monitoring
is conducted through various strategies that facilitate the identification of
brokers and allow for the adjustment of resource allocation across
different localities. Consistent with previous research (Szwarcberg, 2015; Gingerich, 2020),
the present findings underscore the significance of ongoing learning in
the selection of brokers and the continual updating of expectations
regarding their performance.
