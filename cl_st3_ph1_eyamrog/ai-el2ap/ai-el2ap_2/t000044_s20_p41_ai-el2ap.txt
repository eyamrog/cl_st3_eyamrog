Finally, a gesture not only reflects cognitive processes but may
also influence them. Empirical evidence indicates that gestures can convey
substantive information, suggesting the possibility that individuals can learn by
observing the gestures produced by others. However, to establish a
causal relationship, it is necessary to experimentally manipulate gesture and
examine the effects of such manipulation on learning outcomes (Goldin-Meadow,
2017).
