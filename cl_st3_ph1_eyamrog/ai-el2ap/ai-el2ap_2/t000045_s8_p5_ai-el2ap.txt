Our analysis indicates that local politicians, specifically mayors and city
councilors, function as intermediaries and serve as significant sources of
support for state legislators. The findings also show that financial
resources and assistance in resolving issues with state agencies are
generally the most highly valued forms of support (Bezerra, 1999;
Meireles, 2019). However, there are notable differences between councilors and
mayors regarding their specific demands and the manner in which
these demands are addressed. The fulfillment of such requests constitutes
the primary mechanism through which representatives maintain political alliances, and,
in this context, the actions of legislators and their offices
are predominantly characterized by a reactive approach.
