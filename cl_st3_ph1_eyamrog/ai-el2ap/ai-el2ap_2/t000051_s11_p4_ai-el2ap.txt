In Bakhtinian dialogism, speakers engage in a dialogical relationship with
what Bakhtin terms “the alien horizon of the understanding receiver”
(Bakhtin, 1981, p. 282), constructing their utterances in consideration of
the listener’s background. According to Morson and Emerson (1990, p.
129), the listener—whether real or imagined—shapes the utterance from its
inception. Consequently, the discursive power exercised in policy statements should
be analyzed not only in terms of their immediate function
and intended addressees, whose responses are anticipated and managed, but
also in terms of their historical function, specifically how such
statements address potential future audiences who may retrospectively assess the
role of the speaker in shaping historical reality. A dialogic
perspective is therefore appropriate for this analysis, as will be
discussed in the following section.
