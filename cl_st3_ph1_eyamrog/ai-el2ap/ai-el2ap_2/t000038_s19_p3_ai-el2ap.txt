Table 2 presents the item factor loadings, along with estimates
of the replicability of factor scores as measured by the
H-index. The H-index assesses the degree to which a set
of items adequately represents a common factor (Ferrando & Lorenzo-Seva,
2018). Values of H greater than 0.80 indicate a well-defined
latent variable that is likely to remain stable across different
studies, whereas lower H values suggest a poorly defined latent
variable that may vary across studies (Ferrando & Lorenzo-Seva, 2018).
