The fourth pillar concerns the fabrication of the final product,
in which the patient receives a prosthetic device in the
form of dentures manufactured from heat-polymerized acrylic resin. This process
involves placing the resin in a plastic muffle with a
silicone barrier, followed by compression using a hydraulic press and
polymerization through a microwave cycle. The dentures are then subjected
to finishing and polishing procedures to achieve the desired surface
quality.
