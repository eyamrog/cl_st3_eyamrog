This is the initial version of the proposed quality assessment
tool for Self-Controlled Case Series (SCCS) and Self-Controlled Risk Interval
(SCRI) studies. It has been applied in five studies: one
master’s dissertation, one published article, two unpublished scientific initiation projects,
one thesis, and one article submitted for publication (20–23). The
tool is based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Criteria (NOC), which has
not been published in a peer-reviewed journal. However, it is
important to note that the instrument was developed using the
Delphi method, has been tested in multiple systematic reviews, and
has been revised throughout this process (25). Despite criticisms of
the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), it has been widely used to
assess studies included in published systematic reviews, supporting its validity
and applicability.
