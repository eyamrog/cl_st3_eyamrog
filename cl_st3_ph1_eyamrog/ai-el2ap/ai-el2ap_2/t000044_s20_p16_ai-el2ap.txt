In 2015, Weinberg, Fukawa-Connelly, and Wiesner conducted a study in
the United States to investigate the role of gestures in
mathematical thinking and communication. The research was carried out at
a public university within the context of an introductory abstract
algebra course. The findings demonstrated that both specific and general
mathematical meanings are conveyed through gestures, underscoring the integrated nature
of the components within the semiotic package.
