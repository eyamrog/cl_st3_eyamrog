It is plausible to suggest that in contexts characterized by
intense electoral competition, such as Brazil, the value of loyalty
increases because it provides legislators with greater predictability regarding their
secure electoral assets, even though acts of disloyalty are not
necessarily subject to exemplary punishment. This does not imply that
investing in brokers is irrational from the perspective of representatives.
Consistent with the arguments presented by Hicken and Nathan (2020),
this behavior may reflect legislatorsâ€™ recognition that, despite inherent risks
and the limited capacity to effectively sanction brokers, their reputations
within municipalities are contingent upon these intermediaries. Additionally, prevailing voter
expectations may incentivize representatives to maintain relationships with brokers, as
failure to do so could result in electoral displacement by
competitors. Regarding informational asymmetry, principals may adopt strategies to mitigate
their reliance on local brokers, such as establishing direct channels
of communication with constituents and seeking independent information from alternative
partners.
