The Núcleo Curucutu, located at 23°59'09.7"S and 46°44'32.5"W, was established
in 1977 alongside the creation of the Parque Estadual Serra
do Mar. It encompasses areas within the municipalities of São
Paulo, Itanhaém, Mongaguá, and Juquitiba. The Núcleo originated from Fazenda
Curucutu, a former coal-producing estate that was acquired by the
State in 1958 and subsequently designated as a Forest Reserve
(Bellato & Mendes 2002; PESM 2021a).
