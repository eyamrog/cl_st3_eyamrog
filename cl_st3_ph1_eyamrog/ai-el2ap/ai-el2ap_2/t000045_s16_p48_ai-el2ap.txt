The interviews provide substantial evidence that legislative offices dedicate significant
time, effort, and personnel to support municipalities and civic organizations
(hereafter referred to as “entities”) in fulfilling the administrative requirements
necessary to access resources from higher levels of government. These
activities illustrate the informational role that state legislators’ offices perform
for mayors and local leaders. By engaging in these efforts,
legislative offices seek to address municipalities’ limitations in human resources
and technical expertise when managing complex legal and administrative processes.
