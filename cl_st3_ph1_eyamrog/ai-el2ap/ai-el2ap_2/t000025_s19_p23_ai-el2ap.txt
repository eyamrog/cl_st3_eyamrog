Three studies (4%) addressed the use of Negative Pressure Wound
Therapy (NPWT) for the management of malignant fungating wound (MFW)-related
pain. Of these, two were case studies (66.6%) and one
was a non-systematic review (33.4%). None of the studies focused
primarily on pain management; instead, they addressed broader MFW-associated symptoms,
and one study did not specify its main objective. The
studies collectively included data from six female patients aged 56
to 62 years, with various primary tumors including sarcomas, breast
cancer, melanoma, and sigmoid cancer. No quantitative or qualitative assessments
of pain were conducted in any of the studies. However,
all studies reported improvements in odor, exudate, and pain, which
were noted to have a positive impact on patients' quality
of life (Table 10).
