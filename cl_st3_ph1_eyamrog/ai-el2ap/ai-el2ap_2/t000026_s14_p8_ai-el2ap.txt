Subsequently, the virtual snowball sampling method was employed to distribute
a survey link via the social network Instagram. This referral
technique involved sending a standardized message that introduced the research
and requested recipients to share the survey with their own
network of contacts. As a result, university students enrolled in
any health-related program, regardless of their educational institution or geographic
location, were able to access and complete the questionnaire.
