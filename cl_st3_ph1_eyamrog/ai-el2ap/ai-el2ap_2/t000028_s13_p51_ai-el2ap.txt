The section begins with activities related to the vocabulary content
from Unit 1: Greetings. Students are presented with images depicting
various greetings, accompanied by blank spaces where they are required
to infer and write the appropriate greeting. The subsequent activity
pertains to Unit 2, which focuses on vocabulary related to
Personal Interests. Similar to the previous exercise, this task presents
images representing different hobbies, and students are instructed to write
the correct terms in the spaces provided. Additionally, there is
a sentence completion exercise in which students indicate their preferred
free-time activities. Continuing with Unit 2, the next activity addresses
Numbers, requiring students to fill in blanks with the corresponding
numbers in their written form.
