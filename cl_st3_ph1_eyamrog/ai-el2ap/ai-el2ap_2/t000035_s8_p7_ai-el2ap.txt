Due to the complexity of conventional denture fabrication techniques, which
require five clinical and laboratory sessions, providing denture services to
indigenous villagers presents significant challenges. Consequently, the use of simplified
prosthetic rehabilitation techniques, which have demonstrated effectiveness, is essential for
addressing the oral health needs of this population. Randomized, controlled,
and blinded studies have indicated that simplified techniques yield outcomes
comparable to those of traditional methods in terms of patient
satisfaction and denture quality. Additionally, the simplified technique is associated
with lower costs, reduced clinical and laboratory time, and restoration
of masticatory function to a level similar to that achieved
with conventional protocols, while also contributing to improvements in oral
health-related quality of life.
