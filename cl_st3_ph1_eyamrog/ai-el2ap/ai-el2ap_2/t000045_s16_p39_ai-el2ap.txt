The final line highlights the inherent uncertainty in some alliances
and indicates that legislators frequently engage in decisions involving significant
risk, a phenomenon also noted by Bezerra (1999). The evidence
presented here suggests that partnerships between representatives and local brokers
are susceptible to adverse selection problems analogous to those found
in principal-agent relationships. Information gathering, learning, and reputation are critical
factors influencing partner selection (Gingerich, 2020). Importantly, the risks associated
with these partnerships are not limited to those in leadership
positions; local brokers also actively initiate alliances and seek information
to enhance the likelihood of successful collaboration.
