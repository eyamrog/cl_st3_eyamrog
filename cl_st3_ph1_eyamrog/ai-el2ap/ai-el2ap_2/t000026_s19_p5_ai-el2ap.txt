Analysis of the correlation between gender and state anxiety indicated
that a greater proportion of women (68%) exhibited moderate levels
of state anxiety compared to men (60.3%). In relation to
trait anxiety, 51.8% of women demonstrated high levels, whereas 57.1%
of men exhibited moderate levels. These findings indicate that the
prevalence and severity of anxiety differ between men and women,
and that these differences vary according to whether state or
trait anxiety is being assessed.
