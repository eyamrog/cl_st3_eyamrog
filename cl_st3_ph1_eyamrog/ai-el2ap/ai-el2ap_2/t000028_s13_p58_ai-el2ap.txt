Although the proposed adaptations are based solely on the studies

value of interdisciplinary collaboration with school educational advisors and Special
Education professionals. Such collaboration can provide additional perspectives beyond those
identified in the present review and may contribute to the
development of more effective strategies for addressing the specific needs
of individual students.
