The mountain range comprising the farm (Figure 2) exhibits well-preserved
vegetation in comparison to the vegetation found at lower altitudes
in the region. The dominant vegetation type is dense tree-shrub,
interspersed with areas of open shrubby caatinga, riparian forests along
a temporary river, as well as rupicolous and aquatic vegetation.
The area surrounding the farm is subject to various anthropogenic
activities, including cattle and goat husbandry and subsistence agriculture; however,
these activities are largely confined to the periphery of the
mountains or areas near residences and do not extend into
the mountainous regions themselves. Floristic sampling was conducted from 2014
to 2017, during which botanical specimens were collected through exploratory
and random walks designed to maximize coverage of the study
area and encompass all present phytophysiognomies. Fertile specimens were collected
and prepared following standard taxonomic procedures (Judd et al. 2009;
IBGE 2012). Key morphological characteristics and other relevant information for
taxon identification were documented in a field notebook, supplemented by
photographic records, geographic coordinates, and descriptions of landscape and soil
features.
