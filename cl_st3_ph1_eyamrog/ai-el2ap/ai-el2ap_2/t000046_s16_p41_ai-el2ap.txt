“[...] Through physical education (PE), I promote health. PE involves
activities that support both mental and physical well-being. By incorporating
playful games, I facilitate this connection. For example, in my
classes, we sometimes play 'queimada,' soccer, or participate in group
activities such as the 'cotia' wheel. These activities enable children
to exercise, thereby supporting their physical health, while also contributing
to their mental well-being” (Sofia – Manager).
