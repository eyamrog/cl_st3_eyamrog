The establishment of the 2-IN-1 feature of Oral-B in HLMA
2 is evident in the sequence from O-BT19 to O-BT23.
The sequence begins with the presentation of two cartons of
Oral-B toothpaste, introduced from the left and right sides by
two hands. The horizontal movement of the cartons from opposite
directions suggests the merging of the two cartons into a
single unit. This visual representation is reinforced by the accompanying
declarative statements: "With Oral-B 2-in-1 toothpaste, it helps your teeth"
and "And gives your mouth long lasting fresh breath," which
support the imagery of the toothpaste cartons combining into one
unified product. As Oral-B is the focal point of the
advertisement, O-BT21 is utilized to emphasize this focus. This is
further highlighted by the display of labels such as "2-IN-1"
and "NEW," as well as the depiction of the Oral-B
carton being held in the right hand of a social
actor to enhance viewer engagement.
