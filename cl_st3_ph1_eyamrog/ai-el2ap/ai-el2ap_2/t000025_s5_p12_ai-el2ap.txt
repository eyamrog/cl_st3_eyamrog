Cryotherapy induces cold-mediated vasoconstriction and muscle spasms, which in turn
slow nerve conduction and reduce pain (Farah et al., 2021).
However, no primary studies assessing the effectiveness of cryotherapy for
malignant fungating wounds (MFWs) have been identified in the past
five years. As a result, cryotherapy is not included in
the European Oncology Nursing Society (EONS) guidelines for the management
of patients with MFWs (EONS, 2015). The absence of recent
primary studies on cryotherapy may be attributable to the emergence
of newer therapies for pain management in MFWs that offer
greater efficacy and ease of application.
