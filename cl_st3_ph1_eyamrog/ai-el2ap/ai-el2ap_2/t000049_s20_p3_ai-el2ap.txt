Detection of the phenomenon refers to situations in which children
interact with materials by perceiving certain characteristics without engaging in
further investigation. For example, Leonardo observes the plastic bottles, lies
down on the ground, aims, and blows on one of
the upright bottles. He repeats this action several times, increasing
the force of his breath each time, until he succeeds
in knocking the bottle over.
