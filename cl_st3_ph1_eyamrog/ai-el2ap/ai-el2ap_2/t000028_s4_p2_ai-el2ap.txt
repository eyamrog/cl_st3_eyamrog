While it is generally accepted that the government is responsible
for providing necessary resources for public education, there are instances
in which schools lack didactic materials required for the education
of blind students. In such cases, the responsibility for adapting
instructional materials, particularly textbooks and printed activities, often falls to
the teacher. Consequently, it is essential for language teachers to
acquire at least a basic understanding of material adaptation techniques
and effective communication strategies with blind students, in order to
employ the most appropriate instructional methods that address their specific
needs and challenges.
