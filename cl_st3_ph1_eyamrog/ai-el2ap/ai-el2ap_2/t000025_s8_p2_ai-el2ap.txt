Malignant fungating wounds (MFWs) are complex, chronic wounds resulting from
the uncontrolled proliferation of infiltrating malignant cells, which compromise skin
integrity. These wounds progressively worsen over time, becoming increasingly extensive
and invasive (Hoshi et al., 2019; Tilley et al., 2020;
Young, 2017). It is estimated that approximately 4% to 15%
of cancer patients develop MFWs, with the majority of cases
affecting the breast (62â€“66%), followed by the head and neck
(24%), and the chest, primarily due to the proximity of
malignant tissue to the skin surface (EONS, 2015; Firmino et
al., 2020; Neves Duarte Lisboa, 2016; O'Neill et al., 2022).
According to the Haisfield-Wolfe and Baxendale-Cox staging system, individuals with
advanced-stage MFWs frequently experience severe symptoms such as malodor, exudate,
pruritus, bleeding, and pain (Haisfield-Wolfe & Baxendale-Cox, 1999). These symptoms
pose substantial challenges for patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals (Santos
& Fuly, 2015; Tilley et al., 2020).
