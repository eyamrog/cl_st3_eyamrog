In recent years, research on distributive politics and clientelism has
increasingly focused on brokers, individuals who act as intermediaries between
politicians or parties and voters or groups. Brokers are considered
central to the organization and maintenance of clientelist networks and
play a significant role in voter mobilization. Several studies attribute
their importance to their deep integration within local communities, which
provides them with detailed knowledge of voters' preferences. This insider
information enables brokers to design and implement distribution strategies—such as
determining what resources to allocate, to whom, when, and in
what quantity—with the objective of maximizing electoral returns (Stokes et
al., 2013; Holland & Palmer-Rubin, 2015; Zarazaga, 2016; Szwarcberg, 2015;
Aspinall, 2014; Novaes, 2018).
