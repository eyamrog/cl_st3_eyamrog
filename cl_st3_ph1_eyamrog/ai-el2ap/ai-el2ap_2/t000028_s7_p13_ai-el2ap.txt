Although most individuals with visual impairment or blindness are over
the age of 50 (Blindness and Vision Impairment, 2021), it
is important to also consider younger individuals, particularly children with
blindness who attend school and often lack adequate support. Based
on these considerations, the target audience for the proposed didactic
adaptation is students with blindness, representing the most severe stage
of visual impairment. By focusing on this group, the adaptation
may be applicable to students across the full spectrum of
visual impairment.
