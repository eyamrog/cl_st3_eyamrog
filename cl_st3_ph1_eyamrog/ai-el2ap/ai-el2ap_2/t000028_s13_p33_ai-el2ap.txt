The studies included in this review contributed not only suggestions
for didactic materials but also offered insights into teaching approaches
and strategies to address challenges faced by blind students in
their academic development. As Uliana (2013, p. 610) states, the
absence of visual perception does not constitute an insurmountable barrier
to students' mathematical progress. Similar findings are observed in other
disciplines, including English language teaching, where educational objectives for blind
students can be attained through the use of accessible resources
and inclusive pedagogical methods.
