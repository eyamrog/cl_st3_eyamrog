Panoramic radiography is frequently utilized in routine dental practice as
it provides a comprehensive overview of the teeth and oral
structures. In most cases, the mandibular canal (MC) can be
identified without significant difficulty, enabling practitioners to assess the risk
of inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) injury during invasive procedures. However,
as a two-dimensional imaging modality, panoramic radiography does not provide
three-dimensional information and may fail to reveal finer anatomical details
of the MC [24].
