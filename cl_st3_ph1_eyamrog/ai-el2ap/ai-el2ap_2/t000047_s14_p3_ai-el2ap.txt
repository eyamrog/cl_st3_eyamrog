After converting the YouTube text into a readable manuscript, the
analyst used the computer's snipping tool to segment the script
into approximately 35 shots, which were categorized according to four
distinct high-level mediated actions (HLMA) as defined by Baldry and
Thibault (2010) and Norris (2019). Each HLMA comprises several low-level
mediated actions (LLMA) that utilize various meaning-making modes. Each shot,
designated as O-BT (Oral-B Transcript), is labeled with its corresponding
operational time period (e.g., O-BT1 (00:00â€“00:01)), as indicated in the
lower left corner. The complexity of the kinesic actions necessitated
the creation of multiple shots, which are discussed in detail
in the relevant sections. Table 1 presents the HLMA shots
and their corresponding time intervals, while Table 2 illustrates the
conversion of spoken modes into written structures. The study systematically
presents the shots and the analysis of spoken modes in
parallel within the discussion section.
