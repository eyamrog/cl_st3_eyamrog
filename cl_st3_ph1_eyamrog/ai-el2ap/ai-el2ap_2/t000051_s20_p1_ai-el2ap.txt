The speech is structured into seven parts: an introduction, five
proposed courses of action, and a concluding section. In the
original text, Scholz states, “Fünf Handlungsaufträge liegen nun vor uns,”
which can be translated as “five mandates of action now
lie ahead of us.” This phrasing implies a degree of
passivity and suggests that these mandates are imposed by an
external source, potentially a higher authority such as moral obligation
or the passage of time, as indicated by the preceding
sentence in which Scholz refers to a challenge “vor die
die Zeit uns gestellt hat” (“that time has brought us
up against”). In contrast, the official English translation renders these
passages as “there are five courses of action that we
must take” and “the challenge that now faces us,” thereby
removing the passive construction and the role of time as
an agent, and instead emphasizing agency and responsibility on the
part of the speaker and audience.
