In non-election years, councilors facilitate the allocation of resources to
social organizations. Because this process does not require approval from
the mayor’s office, councilors play a particularly significant role in
municipalities where the representative does not have the support of
the mayor, allowing them to mediate independently. However, when a
councilor submits a request of a more collective nature, coordination
with the Executive branch becomes necessary, as the latter is
responsible for implementation. In such cases, disputes over credit may
arise, and a favorable outcome often depends on the mayor’s
willingness to cooperate. Nevertheless, according to most interviewees, these transactions
generally proceed without significant obstacles. This is largely because it
is politically disadvantageous for mayors to refuse resources and benefits
for the municipality, even when these are facilitated by opposition
councilors or political groups.
