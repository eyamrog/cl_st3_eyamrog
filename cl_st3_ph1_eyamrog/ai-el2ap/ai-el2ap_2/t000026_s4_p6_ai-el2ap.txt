Despite certain limitations, this study is among the first to
examine the correlation between anxiety and anxiolytic use among university
students enrolled in various health-related programs in the country, which
adds value to the research. The findings indicate a moderate
to high prevalence of both state and trait anxiety associated
with the use of anxiolytic medications among these students. Given
these results, universities represent important settings for health promotion, and
further research evaluating anxiety and informing management strategies is warranted
to potentially reduce the reliance on pharmacological interventions among students.
