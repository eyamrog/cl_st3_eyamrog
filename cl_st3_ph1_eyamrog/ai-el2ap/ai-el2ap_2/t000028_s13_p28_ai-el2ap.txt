Ferreira and Dickman (2015) identified key considerations for classroom inclusion
through interviews with blind students. One participant emphasized that blind
students should be provided with equivalent conditions and necessary adaptations
to achieve the same level of understanding as their peers.
The participant also highlighted the significance of practical activities and
ongoing dialogue between teachers and students to prevent subjects such
as Physics from becoming excessively challenging and discouraging. Based on
these findings, Ferreira and Dickman (2015) proposed several adaptation strategies
suggested by both teachers and students, including the provision of
printed descriptions for images and graphs, as well as the
use of tactile models to facilitate interpretation by blind students.
