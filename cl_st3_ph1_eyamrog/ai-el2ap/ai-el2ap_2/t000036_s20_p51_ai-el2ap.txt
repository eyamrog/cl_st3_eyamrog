On January 13, 1936, a decree was published that established
specific salary adjustments for federal civil personnel, as outlined in
the law enacted on the same date. Under this decree,
workers earning less than 150 milreis had their salaries increased
to 200 milreis. For those with incomes between 150 and
1,500 milreis, salaries were increased by 40% up to 500
milreis, by 20% per milreis up to 1,000 milreis, and
by 10% per milreis up to 1,500 milreis. Employees earning
between 1,500 and 2,500 milreis received a fixed increase of
300 milreis, while those with incomes between 2,500 and 3,000
milreis received an increase of 250 milreis. Finally, workers with
incomes between 3,000 and 4,000 milreis were granted an increase
of 200 milreis.
