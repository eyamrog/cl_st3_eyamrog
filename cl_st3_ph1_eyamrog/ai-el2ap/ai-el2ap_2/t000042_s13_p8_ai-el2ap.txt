Meanwhile, vaccination presented a political opportunity for Doria, who pledged
to supply vaccines not only to São Paulo but also
to the rest of Brazil. The demand for vaccines increased
in January 2021, as the consequences of widespread disregard for
social distancing during New Year celebrations became evident. At this
time, a new variant of COVID-19 emerged in Manaus, the
largest city in the Amazon region, where approximately 40% of
residents lack access to piped water and face shortages of
hospitals and medical supplies. The outbreak in Manaus raised significant
concerns, even among proponents of herd immunity. Epidemiologists had estimated
that the infection rate in Manaus following the initial outbreak
in March 2020 was as high as 76%, and, based
on the assumption that prior infection conferred immunity, they considered
a major resurgence unlikely. However, the new variant proved to
be not only more transmissible but also capable of reinfecting
individuals who had previously recovered from other variants. By the
end of February 2021, cases of the new variant had
been identified in 21 of Brazil’s 26 states.
