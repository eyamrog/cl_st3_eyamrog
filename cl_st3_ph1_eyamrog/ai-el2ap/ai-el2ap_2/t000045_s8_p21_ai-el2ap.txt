While some scholars characterize brokers as party agents embedded within
large and dense networks typical of political machines (Stokes et
al., 2013), others contend that a broader range of broker
profiles emerges in more fluid and weakly institutionalized party systems
(Aspinall, 2014; Muñoz, 2014; Mares and Young, 2016). Brokers may
be motivated by political, ethnic, religious, or territorial loyalties, pursue
long-term material benefits, seek immediate material rewards (Aspinall, 2014), or
prioritize the interests of their respective groups (Holland and Palmer-Rubin,
2015). Additionally, some brokers may lack formal affiliations with parties
or organizations and operate as independent agents, frequently shifting allegiances
even within the same electoral cycle (Muñoz, 2014; Aspinall, 2014;
Novaes, 2018).
