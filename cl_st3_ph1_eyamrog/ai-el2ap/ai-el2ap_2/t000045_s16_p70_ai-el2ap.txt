Some mayors attribute the eventual shift in political alignment to
changes in local political dynamics or to modifications in party
electoral strategies. With respect to the issue of exclusivity, the
interviews revealed divergent viewpoints. One interviewee argued that it is
most appropriate for mayors to maintain loyalty to a single
state legislator. In contrast, other respondents indicated that diversifying alliances
is a viable option, particularly when the allied legislator is
in opposition to the state governor and consequently has reduced
access to resources, a pattern also identified by Bezerra (1999).
