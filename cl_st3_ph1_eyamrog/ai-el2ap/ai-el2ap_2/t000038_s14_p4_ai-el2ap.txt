We use the H index to evaluate the extent to
which a set of items represents a common factor, specifically
assessing factor stability (Ferrando & Lorenzo-Seva, 2018). The H index
ranges from 0 to 1 and indicates the strength of
the latent variable across different studies. High H values (greater
than 0.80) indicate a well-defined latent variable, whereas low H
values suggest that the latent variable is poorly defined (Ferrando
& Lorenzo-Seva, 2018).
