The limited amount of research in the field of education
has a direct impact on classroom practices, as there is
insufficient accessible guidance for teachers to independently adapt printed materials
for blind students. Additional challenges stem from inadequate coverage of
special education topics in undergraduate teacher education programs (Ferreira &
Dickman, 2015; Camargo & Nardi, 2006; Oliveira & Reily, 2014),
where prospective teachers are only briefly introduced to these issues.
This situation is evidenced in the study by Oliveira and
Reily (2014), who conducted semi-structured interviews with five blind music
students to investigate their learning processes and identify barriers to
accessing and learning music. Their findings suggest a lack of
coursework in undergraduate programs that addresses the specific needs of
students with disabilities (Oliveira & Reily, 2014, p. 417). A
similar situation is observed in the teacher education programs at
the Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM), including the English
major, where only a single course in the curriculum addresses
various aspects of special education. Furthermore, Ferreira and Dickman (2015,
p. 245) report that in-service teachers face daily challenges such
as violence, low pay, indiscipline, and institutional assessments, which may
hinder their pursuit of continued professional development focused on adapting
instruction for students with disabilities.
