In both waves of the survey, allocating amendments was identified
as the third most valued parliamentary activity among five categories,
with 16.0% of respondents selecting it in the first wave
and 18.2% in the second, ranking it behind lawmaking and
addressing state-level issues. While this indicates that allocating amendments is
a notable activity, it does not occupy the highest priority
among respondents. The responses may be influenced by social desirability
bias. Nevertheless, it is important to recognize that while amendments
may play a central role in the interactions between legislators
and their local brokers, they are not necessarily indicative of
legislators' overall performance as state representatives. Additionally, the composition of
the interviewee sample, which is biased toward “municipalists,” may further
emphasize the importance of pork barrel activities for these legislators.
