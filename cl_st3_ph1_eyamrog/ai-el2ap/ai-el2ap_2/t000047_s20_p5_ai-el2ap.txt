Social Actor 1 supports the concern about breath sensation, initially
raised by Social Actor 2, by using the toothbrush in
his hand as a gestural emphasis. Social Actor 1 then
rotates his head to facilitate eye contact and poses the
question, "The answer?" In this context, the interrogative clause is
elliptical, omitting elements for brevity and impact, as described by
Cook (2001). The full form would be, "What is the
answer?" This fragmentation aligns with the principles of aptness and
textual economy in advertising (Leech, 1966; Gieszinger, 2001). Social Actor
2 responds with the word "Easy," which, in a complete
form, would be the imperative clause "[Take it] easy." However,
consistent with the aforementioned principles, the use of "Easy" in
this context serves as a concise and effective communicative strategy
in advertising. The response aims to reassure Social Actor 1,
reflecting Social Actor 2's confidence in the Oral-B product, while
maintaining a sense of suspense for Social Actor 1.
