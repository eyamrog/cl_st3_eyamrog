According to Linda Alexander Rodr√≠guez (1992), approximately half of the
population was indigenous and practiced a sedentary lifestyle, with diets
primarily based on grains and tubers. These communities engaged in
exchange activities, trading their woven textiles for products such as
cow's milk, goats or cows for meat, poultry, or sheep
wool (Banco Central del Ecuador, 1940).
