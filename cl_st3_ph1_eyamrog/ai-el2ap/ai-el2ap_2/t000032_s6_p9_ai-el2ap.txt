Certain factors, such as the likelihood of qualification and match
outcomes—particularly defeat—affected the variation in Present Mood States (PMS) observed
during the study period. This was evidenced by an increased
frequency and intensity of PMSL Factors associated with negative hedonic
value, as indicated by statements such as “I am angry,”
“I am sad,” “I feel humiliated,” and “I feel ashamed”
following matches. Additionally, there was a decrease in the presence
of Factors III (Hope) and VII (Interest) at the conclusion
of the study period, coinciding with the team’s loss of
qualification prospects. Previous research has demonstrated that defeat is associated
with heightened negative emotions and diminished positive emotions among athletes
after competition (Ahmadi et al., 2015; Lewis et al., 2017;
Rubio, 2006), and that the intensity of negative mood states
fluctuates as competition progresses (Bueno & Di Bonifácio, 2007). Further
research is warranted to determine how other outcomes, such as
draws or victories, may influence the presence and evolution of
specific Present Mood States throughout a competitive period.
