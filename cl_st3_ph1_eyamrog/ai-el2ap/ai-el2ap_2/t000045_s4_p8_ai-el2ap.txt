A third analytical task is to examine the differences that
characterize the relationships between local brokers and state or national
representatives. Notably, the analysis revealed significant similarities with findings reported
by Bezerra (1999) in a study conducted two decades earlier.
Further research is warranted to identify the underlying causes of
these similarities, particularly in light of the distinct roles and
levels of authority held by national and state legislators. One
possible explanation is that national and state representatives, operating under
the same institutional rules and within the same electoral districts,
may face comparable incentives. However, the study also identified important
differences, such as the larger volume of resources accessible to
national legislators for supporting their allies and the closer proximity
of state legislators to their constituencies. These findings suggest the
existence of a division of labor among legislators, with local
brokers selecting which representative to approach based on the specific
issue or need in question.
