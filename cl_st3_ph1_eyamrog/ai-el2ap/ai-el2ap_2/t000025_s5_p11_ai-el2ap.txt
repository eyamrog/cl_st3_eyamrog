The case studies reviewed utilized negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT)
to manage symptoms of malignant fungating wounds (MFWs) and reported
improvements in patients' quality of life. Although NPWT is generally
contraindicated for MFWs, further research is warranted to evaluate its
role in palliative care settings (Riot et al., 2015). NPWT
establishes a closed wound environment, which facilitates moisture control, removal
of excess exudate, reduction of microbial load, enhancement of perfusion,
stimulation of mitosis, and granulation tissue formation. However, these effects
are not always desirable in the context of MFWs, as
cellular proliferation and granulation are not primary treatment objectives (Cai
et al., 2017). Additionally, malignant cells can promote the development
of fragile neovasculature, increasing the risk of bleeding; therefore, the
use of NPWT in MFWs requires careful assessment and caution
(Firmino et al., 2021).
