One randomized clinical trial (Lund-Nielsen et al., 2011), as cited
in a systematic review by Adderley and Holt (2014), reported
favorable outcomes associated with the use of antimicrobials for the
management of malignant fungating wound (MFW) odor, exudate, and pain.
In total, three studies evaluated the effectiveness of antimicrobials in
controlling MFW symptoms, including pain. Among these, two were randomized
clinical trials and one was a retrospective cohort study involving
192 patients with MFWs, predominantly women aged 47 to 90
years, most of whom had breast cancer. The two randomized
clinical trials utilized a verbal numeric scale and a visual
analog scale to assess pain, both demonstrating significant improvement in
pain levels. In contrast, the retrospective cohort study did not
observe a statistically significant effect on pain outcomes (Table 7).
