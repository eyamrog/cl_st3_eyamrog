The documents indicate that, from early 1990 through 1991, several
national leaders actively considered and ultimately rejected the prospect of
Central and Eastern European countries joining NATO. Furthermore, discussions regarding
NATO during the German unification negotiations in 1990 were not
confined solely to the status of East German territory. The
records also demonstrate that later Soviet and Russian claims of
being misled about NATO expansion were based on contemporaneous written
memoranda of conversations and telephone communications at the highest governmental
levels (Savranskaya & Blanton, 2017).
