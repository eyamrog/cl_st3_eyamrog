Although the treatment of edentulism is recommended to be conducted
in primary care settings, it is frequently performed in specialized
care through the provision of removable complete dentures. The fabrication
of these dentures typically involves five clinical sessions, each followed
by corresponding laboratory procedures. This five-session protocol is also endorsed
by the Ministry of Health in the manual "Oral Health
in the National Health Service," and is required to be
implemented either in Basic Health Units or in Specialist Dental
Centers, depending on the organizational structure of the respective municipality.
