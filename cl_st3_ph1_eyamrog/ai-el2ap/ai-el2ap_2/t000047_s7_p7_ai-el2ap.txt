The discussion of modes encompasses topics such as the analysis
of aesthetics in digital environments (Adami, 2014), the function of
pictorial images as language in online newspapers (Knox, 2016), and
the contextualization of film discourse within the GeM framework (Bateman,
2013). Additionally, research addresses the positioning of multiliteracy within the
field of multimodality (Eisenmann & Meyer, 2018), the cognitive semiotics
of gesture (Iriskhanova & Cienki, 2018), and the role of
gestural modes in supporting persuasive political commentary (Kra≈õnicka, 2020). Martin
and Zappavigna (2018) and Unsworth (2020) emphasize the need to
explicate embodied meaning in paralanguage, particularly in relation to Systemic
Functional Linguistics (SFL) perspectives and intermodal relationships within school science
genres. Furthermore, Hiippala and Bateman (2020), Bezerra (2020), and Dalamu
(2021) examine communicative challenges by analyzing diagrammatic modes and the
multimodal construction of cinematic representations of female actors within specific
films and semiotic genres.
