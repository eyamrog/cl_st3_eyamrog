The 1930s can be divided into two distinct periods: the
first was marked by the impact of the Great Depression,
while the second was characterized by a gradual economic recovery.
During the initial period, monetary policies were implemented, including adherence
to the gold standard and the centralization of currency issuance
through the Central Bank of Ecuador.
