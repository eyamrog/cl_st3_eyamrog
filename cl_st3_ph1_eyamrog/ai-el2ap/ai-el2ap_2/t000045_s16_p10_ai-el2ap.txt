An important finding from the interviews, which is often overlooked
in the literature, is that “support from the municipality” does
not necessarily equate to “support from the mayor.” Advisors commonly
refer to these relationships as “representatives’ municipalities” (municípios do deputado)
or “our municipalities” (nossos municípios). The determining factor for whether
a municipality is considered to be aligned with a legislator
is not limited to the mayor’s support but may also
involve the backing of other political figures, such as city
councilors, former mayors, former councilors, or individuals who have previously
run for office or intend to do so in the
future. Thus, a legislator can exert influence over a municipality
without necessarily having the explicit support of the mayor.
