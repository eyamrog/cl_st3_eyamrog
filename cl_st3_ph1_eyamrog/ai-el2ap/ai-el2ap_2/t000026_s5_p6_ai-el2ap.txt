Another significant finding of this study was that female participants
exhibited higher levels of moderate state anxiety compared to male
participants. Recent studies indicate that state anxiety among female university
students is associated with transient anxiety responses that fluctuate in
relation to academic stimuli, leading to temporary negative emotional states
(Deer et al., 2018; Thomas & Cassady, 2021).
