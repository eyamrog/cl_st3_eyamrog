Several floristic studies have been conducted in Caatinga areas in
the interior of Para√≠ba (Santos et al. 2010; Lucena et
al. 2015; Silva et al. 2015; Gadelha-Neto et al. 2018),
and the species composition observed in these studies is similar
to that found in the present research. Consistent with previous
findings, Fabaceae is the most species-rich family at the ABA
Farm, confirming its status as one of the most abundant
plant families in the Caatinga.
