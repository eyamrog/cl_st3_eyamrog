In the current context, this rationale underlies the European Union’s
decision to ban Russian state-owned media, described by President Ursula
von der Leyen as the “Kremlin’s media machine,” in order
to prevent the dissemination of what she characterizes as “toxic
and harmful disinformation” intended to justify Russia’s actions in Ukraine
and to create division within the EU (von der Leyen,
2022). This approach is predicated on the assumption that Western
media systems are inherently free and balanced, whereas those of
adversarial states are perceived as ideologically driven and propagandistic. Familiarity
with one’s own media environment can obscure the potential effects
of exposure to one-sided, emotionally charged war propaganda, including its
influence on public reasoning, policy endorsement, and attitudes toward dissent
(Greenwald, 2022). The concept of a “new reality” is thus
articulated from within an idealized Western order, which is perceived
as being disrupted by non-Western powers and ideologies. From a
non-Western perspective, the invasion of Ukraine is not viewed as
an unprecedented deviation from an established order, but rather as
a continuation of patterns that have not always aligned with
Western narratives (Bacevich, 2022). This perspective is informed by the
understanding that international law is not absolute, but contingent upon
the willingness and capacity of states to enforce it, and
that the United States’ influence over global narratives often determines
the application of such laws (C. Johnstone, 2022). In terms
of discursive power, NATO’s discourse is hegemonic and shapes the
framework within which international relations are conducted, compelling other states,
including Russia and China, to operate within these parameters (Cook,
2022). This dynamic often results in the actions of non-NATO
states being framed as escalatory, while NATO’s actions are typically
presented as necessary responses. Such hegemony enables NATO to define
key terms and employ euphemisms, such as “preventive war,” “humanitarian
war,” and “collateral damage,” to shape public understanding of military
interventions. To contextualize the current conflict, a brief overview of
the relevant background will now be provided.
