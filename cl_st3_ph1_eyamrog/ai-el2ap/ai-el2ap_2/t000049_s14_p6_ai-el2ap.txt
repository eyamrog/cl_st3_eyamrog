Promotion from within (Bondioli, 2008; Bondioli & Savio, 2009; Bondioli,
2015a; Savio, 2003; Bondioli & Savio, 2012; Savio, 2013) refers
to an educational model in which the adult facilitates and
supports exploratory actions by the child. In this model, the
teacher adopts a responsive stance, waiting for and acknowledging the
child’s initiatives, encouraging questions, and mirroring the scientific attitudes demonstrated
by the children toward the materials, both verbally and non-verbally.
The teacher further extends the children’s initiatives by providing demonstrations
and elaborating on their exploratory and inventive activities. These practices
characterize a participative approach that prioritizes the child’s interests and
enables active participation in the learning process. The objective of
this approach is to examine whether, and to what extent,
adult intervention aimed at stimulating children’s interests and curiosity—without exerting
control over their ideas—can influence the development and expression of
scientific attitudes.
