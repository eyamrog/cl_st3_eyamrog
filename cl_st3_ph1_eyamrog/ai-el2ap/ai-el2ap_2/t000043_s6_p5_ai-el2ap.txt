The proposed quality assessment tool has been utilized in several
studies, some of which have been published or are currently
under peer review. This tool represents an adaptation developed in
response to specific requirements for evaluating self-controlled study designs. It
is intended that the tool will undergo a Delphi process
to validate its use and improve its applicability. The expectation
is that this tool will facilitate the critical assessment of
the methodological quality of SCCS and SCRI studies and that
it will be subject to ongoing refinement and adaptation by
the scientific community.
