The species exhibited limited fruiting records during the course of
this study, with fruits of G. monophylla observed only once
and in a small number of individuals. The lack of
fruiting records may be attributable to limitations in data collection,
as the fruits develop within bracts that typically undergo a
blackening process, making them difficult to detect.
