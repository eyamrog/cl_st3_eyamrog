Policy statements serve both immediate and historical functions. In the
immediate context, a policy statement can act as a formal
exercise of the chancellor’s “Richtlinienkompetenz” (policy-making authority) (Stüwe, 2005, pp.
26–43), by articulating guidelines and programmes intended to direct the
actions of the entire coalition government (Korte, 2002, p. 456).
From a historical perspective, policy statements are regarded as documents
in which the identification or omission of specific issues, as
well as the language employed, provide primary sources for analyzing
and interpreting the chancellor’s historical role (Korte, 2002, p. 457).
