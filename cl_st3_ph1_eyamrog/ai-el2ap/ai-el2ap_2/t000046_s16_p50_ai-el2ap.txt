Physical Education (PE) is perceived as important; however, it is
not currently fulfilling its intended role. According to Juliana, a
Geography teacher, when some students remain seated while only a
small group participates in activities such as soccer, PE fails
to address the health issues it is designed to mitigate.
Bruna, also a Geography teacher, notes that while it is
widely recognized that physical activity benefits health, societal changes have
led to increased sedentary behavior. Historically, humans engaged in activities
such as fishing, hunting, and running to obtain food, but
contemporary lifestyles have made food easily accessible, contributing to higher
rates of obesity. Therefore, regular exercise remains essential for maintaining
health.
