Entomological research conducted within the SIL aimed to enhance understanding
of the transmission dynamics of American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) following
an observed increase in ACL cases among the Suruwaha population
between 2010 and 2012. The investigation indicated that this rise
in cases was likely associated with the community-wide distribution of
flashlights in late 2010, which had been requested by the
Suruwaha. The provision of flashlights appears to have facilitated a
shift in the Suruwahaâ€™s hunting practices from exclusively diurnal to
nocturnal activities, thereby increasing exposure to the primarily crepuscular and
nocturnal blood-feeding female sand flies responsible for ACL transmission.
