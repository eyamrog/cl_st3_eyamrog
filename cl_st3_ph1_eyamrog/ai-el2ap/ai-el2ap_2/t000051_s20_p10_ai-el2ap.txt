This discourse is also evident in the phrase presented in
example (3), where Scholz anticipates a potential argument referencing the
OSCE accords. In order to preclude such arguments in favor
of a Eurasian partnership, he links the concept of indivisible
security with the notion of a historical watershed by employing
a counter-argumentative structure: he concedes that long-term peace in Europe
is achievable only with Russia, but qualifies this by asserting
that, for the foreseeable future, Russia poses a threat to
that security, a position reinforced by the statement in the
final sentence.
