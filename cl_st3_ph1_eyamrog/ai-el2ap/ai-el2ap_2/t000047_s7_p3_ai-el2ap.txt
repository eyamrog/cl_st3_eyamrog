Against this background, clarifying the concept of mode is essential,
particularly by drawing on insights from micro-linguistics, which currently provides
a foundational framework for social semiotics. This relationship may justify

social semiotics, despite some objections regarding the potential for linguistic
conceptual dominance (Bateman, Delin, & Henshel, 2002; Bezemer & Jewitt,
2010).
