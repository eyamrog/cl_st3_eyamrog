both quantitative and qualitative methods. The quantitative analysis enabled specific
observations concerning the manifestation and development of scientific categories, communication
methods, and socialization associated with these attitudes. Additionally, the analysis
of the schemes related to the adultâ€™s role facilitated an
investigation into the strategies and functions that most effectively support
and promote learning processes in children.
