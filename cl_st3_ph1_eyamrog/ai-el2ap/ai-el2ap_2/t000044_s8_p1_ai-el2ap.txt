When individuals speak, they frequently produce gestures that convey information
not readily accessible through speech alone. This phenomenon is also
observed among students, whose gestures can indicate moments of conceptual
uncertainty. Teachers can utilize these gestures to gain insights into
students' cognitive processes. Additionally, students may generate new ideas based
on the gestures they themselves produce during instruction or those
demonstrated by their teachers. Consequently, gesture serves not only as
a reflection of a student's understanding of a problem but
also as a potential mechanism for facilitating conceptual change (Novack
& Goldin-Meadow, 2015).
