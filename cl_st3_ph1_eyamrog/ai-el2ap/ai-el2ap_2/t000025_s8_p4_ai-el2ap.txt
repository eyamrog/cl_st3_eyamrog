The mechanism underlying pain associated with malignant fungating wounds (MFW)
is complex and multifactorial, primarily due to persistent infection resulting
from a high local microbial load (Vardhan et al., 2019),
irritation of exposed nerve endings often exacerbated by trauma during
dressing changes, tumor growth causing pressure on surrounding body structures,
and edema resulting from impaired lymphatic and capillary drainage. Consequently,
patients may experience nociceptive, neuropathic, inflammatory, or mixed types of
pain, depending on the specific underlying trigger (EONS, 2015; Naylor,
2001).
