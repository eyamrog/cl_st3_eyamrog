The mood states analyzed in the present study exhibited variations
that may be attributed to the match serving as a
significant temporal reference point for these changes. Time perspective is
a relevant factor to consider when predicting how mood states
fluctuate over time (Stolarski et al., 2019). The assessment conducted
two days prior to the match indicated diverse mood states
among participants. Previous research has demonstrated an association between athletes’
mood states and the temporal progression during competitive periods. For
example, Keikha et al. (2015) used the Profile of Mood
States (POMS) at multiple time points to evaluate university athletes
from various sports and found that mood state profiles differed
only one day before competitions, remaining stable when assessed one
hour and one week prior (cf. Vega Marcos et al.,
2008). Similarly, Hassmén and Blomstrand (1995) assessed soccer players’ mood
states using the POMS one hour before, immediately after, and
two hours after a match, and identified differences in mood
profiles across these time points, which were associated with the
outcomes of the matches.
