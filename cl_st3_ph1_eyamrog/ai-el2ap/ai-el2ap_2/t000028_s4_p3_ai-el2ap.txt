Some options for teachers to adapt didactic activities include the
use of tactile resources, auditory materials such as sounds and
songs, and the incorporation of games or group activities that
emphasize sensory modalities other than vision. These adaptations can increase
blind studentsâ€™ confidence and willingness to participate in class, which
are important factors in additional language learning, and can also
promote a greater sense of inclusion among both teachers and
classmates.
