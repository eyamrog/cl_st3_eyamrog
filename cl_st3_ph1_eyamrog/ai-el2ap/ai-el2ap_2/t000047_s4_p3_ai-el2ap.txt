The lexical groups are strongly supported by the use of
images and gestures. This is evident in the indexical appearances
of Social Actor 1 and Social Actor 2, who both
wear lab coats to communicate the dual-functionality of the product
to consumers. These visual and verbal elements enable the participants
to collectively assert that the New Oral-B 2-IN-1 Toothpaste strengthens
teeth and provides long-lasting fresh breath, as demonstrated in examples
2a and 2b. In addition to the consistent display of
the Oral-B label in every shot of the LLMA, there
is a clear integration between the spoken content and the
visual imagery. The actors frequently display their teeth and smile
while engaging directly with the audience, emphasizing the productâ€™s benefits.
The white teeth and lab coats symbolize both the intended
results of using Oral-B and the professional standards associated with
the product. The color white is used to suggest purity,
while the blue color scheme positions the advertisement as calm
yet assertive.
