In the national context, there is a lack of studies
examining the relationship between anxiety and the use of anxiolytics
among students from various undergraduate health-related programs. Existing research predominantly
focuses on medical or nursing students. This gap highlights the
need for universities and researchers to conduct studies that encompass
a broader range of health disciplines in order to accurately
represent the national situation and inform the development, implementation, and
evaluation of preventive interventions.
