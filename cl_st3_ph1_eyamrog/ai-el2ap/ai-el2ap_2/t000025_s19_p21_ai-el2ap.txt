Five articles (7%) reported the use of topical honey for
the management of pain associated with malignant fungating wounds (MFWs).
However, none of these studies specifically focused on pain management;
instead, they addressed the overall control of MFW symptoms, including
pain. Two reviews—one systematic and one non-systematic (Adderley & Holt,
2014; Praptiwi, 2017)—included two primary studies that reported positive effects
of honey in controlling MFW-related odor, exudate, and pain. These
studies collectively analyzed data from 384 patients, predominantly women, with
a mean age ranging from 44 to 90 years, most
of whom had breast tumors. Pain assessment using a visual
analog scale was conducted in only one study (Lund-Nielsen et
al., 2011) (see Table 8).
