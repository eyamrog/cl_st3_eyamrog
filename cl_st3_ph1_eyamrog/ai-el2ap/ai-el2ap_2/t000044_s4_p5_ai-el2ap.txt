In conclusion, addressing the research question regarding the contribution of
gestures (non-verbal communication) to the teaching and learning process, the
findings indicate that gestures constitute a significant factor that should
not be overlooked. Their analysis warrants integration into teacher training
curricula. Consequently, both educational research and pedagogical practice, in formal
and non-formal contexts, should recognize non-verbal communication—particularly gestures—as being as
important and relevant as verbal communication. Further research is necessary
to delineate the boundaries and potential of utilizing this channel
of communication in educational settings.
