This article analyzes governmental responses to COVID-19 in several developing
countries through the framework of Achille Mbembe’s concept of “Necropolitics.”
From this perspective, neoliberal governments during the pandemic exercised a
form of sovereignty characterized by the management of life and
death, which resulted in the proliferation of disease and increased
mortality and infection rates among marginalized and discriminated populations. Using
data from newspaper articles, internet sources, contemporary publications, and public
health information from Brazil and India, the article describes and
compares necropolitical dynamics in both countries. The authors argue that
governmental responses in Brazil and India during the first year
of the pandemic (approximately February 2020 to March 2021) constituted
a regulated form of necropolitics that fluctuated in intensity according
to political contexts and mortality rates, ultimately normalizing high mortality
within public opinion. The heads of state in Brazil and
India (Jair Bolsonaro and Narendra Modi) made policy decisions that
effectively determined differential exposure to risk and mortality, while framing
high mortality rates as incidental and not attributable to state
action. Despite differences in their approaches—such as Bolsonaro’s minimization of
the virus as “a little flu” and Modi’s implementation of
a European-style lockdown—both strategies resulted in significant public health crises.
The two leaders also exhibited additional similarities in their management
of the pandemic.
