The remaining twenty-five percent of the population consisted of wage
workers and farmers engaged primarily in internal trade. The rest
of the economically active population included public sector employees, merchants,
industrialists, and renters, all of whom participated actively in the
local market. This group was also connected to the external
sector, as they both consumed imported goods and produced goods
for export.
