The grammatical communicative devices identified include the use of the
generic "you" in reference to teeth, which appears approximately three
times, and the mode "fresh," which is operational in variants
such as "long lasting fresh breath," "breath feeling," "so fresh,"
"still fresh," and "stay fresh." Additional linguistic elements such as
"strong" and "smile" are also employed to promote the product's
association with dental health. The term "strong" is presented in
contexts such as "strong and healthy," "helps strengthening," and "stay
strong," while "smile" is used three times consecutively. The consistent
use of blue and white color schemes is noted to
convey a sense of reliability and cleanliness (Chiazzari, 1998; van
Leeuwen, 2016). Emphasis on smiles, specific linguistic structures, and color
palettes not only distinguishes the Oral-B brand but also increases
its prominence, thereby encouraging viewers to pay particular attention to
the advertisement and consider purchasing the product.
