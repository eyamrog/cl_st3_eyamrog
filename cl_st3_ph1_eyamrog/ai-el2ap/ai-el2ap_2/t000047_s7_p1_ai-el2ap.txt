The precise definition of "mode" has been the subject of
considerable debate within the knowledge-based industry. Since the emergence of
multimodality as a field, various elements constituting mode have been
described in multiple ways, and there remains no universally accepted
definition (Jewitt, 2009; Bateman, Wildfeuer & Hiippala, 2017; Forceville, 2020).
Disciplines such as multimodality are shaped by concepts that are
adapted to the specific knowledge frameworks of their respective fields.
This disciplinary context contributes to ongoing discussions regarding the components
and structure of what is referred to as mode. The
lack of consensus is not unexpected, given the necessity for
a clear and precise understanding of the concept of mode
(Kress, 2010). Achieving such clarity would enable researchers and practitioners
in multimodality to develop a more comprehensive and accurate understanding
of the central focus of this evolving field.
