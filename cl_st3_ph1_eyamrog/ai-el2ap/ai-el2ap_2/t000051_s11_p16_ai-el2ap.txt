The interpretation of NATO expansion varies significantly depending on the
observer’s perspective. Some view it as an effort to prevent
the emergence of a Eurasian alliance (Klare, 2022), while others
regard it as a justifiable response to the appeals of
new Central and Eastern European democracies, which may have contributed
to the deterioration of East-West cooperation (Sarotte, 2021). Alternatively, it
has been described as a major strategic error in the
post-Cold War era (Kennan, 1997). These divergent assessments underscore the
absence of a single objective position. According to Bakhtinian dialogism,
engagement with discourse inherently involves evaluation and response, rather than
mere commentary (Todorov, 1984, p.16). In the dynamic context of
politics, analysts not only observe but also influence political processes,
making decision and standpoint inseparable (Mannheim, 1936, p.152). Consequently, individual
perspectives—sometimes referred to as researcher bias—are inevitably present in any
form of analysis (Davis, 1990, p.16; Gee, 2011, p.9). This
understanding informs the methodological approach outlined in the following section.
