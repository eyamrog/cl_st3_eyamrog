The Oral-B advertisement features four distinct settings: the Oral-B Dental
Institute office, a bathroom, the home of Social Actor 3,
and her workplace. Each setting reflects commonly recognized spatial arrangements
within society. The advertisement employs various color schemes, including blue,
which is traditionally associated with the Oral-B brand, and white,
which serves to position Social Actors 1 and 2 as
professionals through its indexical association with cleanliness and expertise. This
professional appearance authorizes the male actors to endorse the toothpaste
based on its attributes. The female actor is depicted wearing
a top in a subdued green shade, while the mint
component of the Oral-B product is also rendered in white.
These color choices serve specific symbolic functions. Blue is interpreted
as conveying calmness, tranquility, and acceptance (Kandinsky, 1977; Gage, 1993).
White, commonly associated with teeth and other elements in the
advertisement, signifies purity, cleanliness, and unity, and is presented as
being above negative criticism (Zelansky & Fisher, 2003). The green
worn by Social Actor 3 likely represents harmony, honesty, and
a connection to nature (Gage, 1999). Although red is typically
linked to fire, its use in the word "New" may
instead evoke excitement, courage, and passion (Heller, 2009). Collectively, these
characteristics are intended to enhance the perceived qualities of Oral-B,
thereby encouraging viewers to consider purchasing the product.
