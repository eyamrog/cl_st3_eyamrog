Student autonomy and independence have been examined in several studies
(Biagini & Gon√ßalves, 2017; Ferreira & Dickman, 2015; Uliana, 2013;
Camargo & Nardi, 2006; Oliveira & Reily, 2014), which highlight
the importance of fostering self-directed learning and decision-making skills among
students. These works emphasize that promoting autonomy contributes to the
development of critical thinking, responsibility, and the ability to manage
one's own learning process effectively.
