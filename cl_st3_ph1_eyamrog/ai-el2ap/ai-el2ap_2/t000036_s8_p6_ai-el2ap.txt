The implementation of wage reforms and changes in labor legal
systems was associated with the rise of populist governments following
the Great Depression. Many politicians utilized these reforms to advance
their political agendas, which often included elements of socialism and
adaptations of Keynesian economic models. Populism was a defining feature
of this period, as exemplified by the administrations of Lázaro
Cárdenas in Mexico (1934–1940), Getulio Vargas in Brazil (1930–1943), and
Juan Domingo Perón in Argentina (1943–1955) (Zapata 2002). In Ecuador,
the first populist government was led by Velasco Ibarra (1934–1935).
In subsequent decades, significant changes occurred in the highland hacienda
system, including the elimination of the Huasipungo system and the
establishment of wage-based labor relations. In the central and northern
regions of Ecuador, there was an increasing coexistence of haciendas
and smallholdings, which combined business and peasant economies. These agrarian
transformations, driven by both peasant acquisition of land and landowner
initiatives, resulted in a shift from patron-peasant relationships to employer-worker
relations (Salamea 1980).
