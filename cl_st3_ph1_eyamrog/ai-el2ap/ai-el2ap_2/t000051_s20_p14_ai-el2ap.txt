The second course of action identified by Scholz is "to
divert Putin from his path of war." In this context,
Scholz enumerates the sanctions imposed on Russia and, employing the
counter-argument strategy, acknowledges that Putin is unlikely to alter his
actions immediately. However, Scholz contends that the impact of these
measures will become apparent in the near future, as emphasized
by the statement "ohne irgendwelche Denkverbote" ("no thought whatsoever is
prohibited"). The discourse framing the conflict as "Putin’s war" is
reiterated through explicit statements such as "gehört es deutlich ausgesprochen:
Dieser Krieg ist Putins Krieg" ("it must be clearly stated
that this war is Putin’s war") and the characterization of
the situation as a "Konflikt zwischen Putin und der freien
Welt" ("conflict between Putin and the free world"). This framing
constructs a dichotomous narrative that positions the conflict as a
binary opposition, comparable to the rhetoric employed by George W.
Bush following the events of September 11, 2001.
