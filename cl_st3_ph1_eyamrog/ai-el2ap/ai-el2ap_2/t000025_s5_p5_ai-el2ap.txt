Studies predominantly focused on the use of dressings as a
topical therapy for managing pain associated with malignant fungating wounds
(MFWs). Particular attention was given to pain resulting from dressing
changes, which is often caused by the adhesion of the
dressing to the wound bed and the subsequent difficulty in
removal. These findings underscore the importance of protecting the fragile
tissue within the wound bed of malignant fungating wounds to
minimize pain during dressing changes (Woo et al., 2015; Woo
& Sibbald, 2010).
