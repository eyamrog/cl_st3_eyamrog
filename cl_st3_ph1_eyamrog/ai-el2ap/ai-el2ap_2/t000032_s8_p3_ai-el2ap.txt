Research on athletes’ mood states has predominantly utilized the Profile
of Mood States (POMS) instrument (Chennaoui et al., 2016; Morgan,
1980), which assesses one positive dimension (Vigor) and five negative
dimensions (Tension, Depression, Confusion, Anger, and Fatigue). This unidimensional emphasis
on positive mood has been identified as a limitation for
the development of theoretical models and intervention methods in this
area (Hagtvet & Hanin, 2007; Hanin, 2012; Hernández, 2016; Prapavessis,
2000). Nevertheless, POMS remains widely employed in research investigating mood
states among athletes globally.
