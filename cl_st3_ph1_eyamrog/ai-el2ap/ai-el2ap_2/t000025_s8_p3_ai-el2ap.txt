Pain is the most frequently reported symptom among individuals living
with malignant fungating wounds (MFWs). However, pain is inherently subjective
and challenging to assess objectively, as its evaluation primarily depends
on self-reported measures (Raja et al., 2020). Consequently, the use
of validated instruments for the systematic assessment of pain is
essential to facilitate consistent monitoring and to evaluate the effectiveness
of pain management interventions over time (Caraceni & Shkodra, 2019).
