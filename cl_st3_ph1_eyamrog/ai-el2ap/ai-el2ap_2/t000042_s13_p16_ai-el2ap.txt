In April 2021, the government permitted large-scale events such as
the Kumbh Mela, a major Hindu festival held on the
banks of the Ganges, without implementing sufficient mitigation measures. The
shortcomings of this policy became apparent by May 2021, when
a second wave of COVID-19 was driven by the more
pathogenic Delta variant, against which existing levels of “herd immunity”
proved relatively ineffective. The Delta variant spread rapidly, with the
daily average of new cases reaching approximately 325,000, and the
country accounting for over 40% of global new cases at
that time. In early June 2021, Prime Minister Modi removed
former Minister of Health Harsh Vardhan from the Cabinet, attributing
responsibility for the crisis to him, and shifted blame for
the second wave to state governments rather than the federal
administration. This approach aimed to attribute the crisis to the
mismanagement of subordinate authorities rather than to federal policy decisions.
Subsequently, as COVID-19-related mortality rates declined, media coverage of the
crisis also decreased.
