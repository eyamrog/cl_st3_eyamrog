Teaching an additional language presents significant challenges, as it requires
teachers to establish a safe and productive environment where students
feel comfortable expressing themselves and where positive rapport is fostered
(Hughey, 2011). The primary objective of an additional language class
is to encourage students to engage in critical thinking and
active language use through participation in multimodal genres, thereby enabling
them to understand language as constitutive of situated social practices
(Motta-Roth & Heberle, 2015, p. 2).
