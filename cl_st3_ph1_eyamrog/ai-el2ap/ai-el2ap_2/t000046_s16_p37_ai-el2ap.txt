In the category of “Good habits,” teacher Carlos identifies the
risk behaviors present in students' environments and proposes physical activities
as an alternative. This perspective is further illustrated by teacher
Daniela, who, in her personal narrative, describes both her own
habits and their adoption by her entire family. This observation
aligns with Devide’s findings (1996; 2002) on the dissemination of
habits; however, it is important to consider additional factors, such
as socioeconomic variables, that may also influence the adoption of
these behaviors.
