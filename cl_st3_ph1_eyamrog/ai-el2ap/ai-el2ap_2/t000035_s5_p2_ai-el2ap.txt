The findings from phase I regarding the impact of oral
health on quality of life are consistent with previous assertions
that edentulous individuals experience physical limitations, particularly in eating, speaking,
and social interactions, which respondents identified as the most significant
problems associated with tooth loss. Among the participants, 68.4% reported
difficulty eating and 63.2% reported difficulty smiling as consequences of
missing teeth, indicating a substantial effect of edentulism on personal,
social, and emotional aspects of quality of life. Additionally, 31.6%
and 26.3% of respondents cited impairments in speech and chewing,
respectively. Furthermore, 42.1% of participants indicated that they did not
use dentures due to financial constraints, supporting evidence that, despite
the availability of prosthetic rehabilitation through the Brazilian National Health
Service, the provision may be inadequate to meet demand, and
a significant proportion of the population either lacks the financial
resources to obtain dentures or does not have access to
public health services. These challenges are also observed among the
Patax√≥ indigenous people of Aldeia Velha.
