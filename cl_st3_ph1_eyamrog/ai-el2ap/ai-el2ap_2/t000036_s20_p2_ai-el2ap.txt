This represents a significant contrast with the Latin American region,
where GDP declined by 16% during the same period (Mitchell
1993:762-764). In Ecuador, however, the primary economic impact was observed
in international trade, which decreased by 55% by 1932 (Naranjo
2021). Within this context, the article addresses three main themes:
the economically active population and purchasing power; the legal framework
governing working conditions; and a brief review of the implementation
of the minimum wage in Ecuador and selected Latin American
countries.
