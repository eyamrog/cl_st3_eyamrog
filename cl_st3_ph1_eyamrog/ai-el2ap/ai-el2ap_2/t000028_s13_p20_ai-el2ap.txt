The findings of Biagini and Gonçalves (2017) illustrate the reliance
of blind students on teacher assistance, which is associated with
insufficient teacher preparation and a lack of information regarding effective
strategies for supporting blind students in the classroom. This situation
may also affect the socialization and self-reflection of blind students,
as observed in the case of João. Despite the adaptation
of group and oral activities to accommodate his impairment, João
participated only in response to interventions from peers and teachers
(Biagini & Gonçalves, 2017).
