In 2017, Matsumoto and Dobs at the University of Pennsylvania
conducted a study examining the role of gesture in teaching
and learning grammar during classroom interactions in a second language,
a topic also explored by Huang, Kin, and Christianson (2019)
in the context of higher education. The study involved analyzing
the gestures employed by teachers to explain temporal concepts in
English, as well as those used by students in their
responses. The findings indicated that both teachers and students frequently
utilized abstract and metaphorical lithic gestures during classroom interactions, suggesting
that such gestures may serve as valuable resources for instruction
and the assessment of student learning.
