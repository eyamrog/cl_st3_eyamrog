Upon accessing the questionnaire link, respondents were first presented with
the Informed Consent Form (ICF), which outlined the voluntary nature
of participation, guaranteed anonymity, and clarified that withdrawal from the
study could occur at any time without adverse consequences. Consent
was obtained electronically by requiring participants to select "I agree
to participate in the research" before proceeding. Subsequently, participants were
directed to a page containing the sociodemographic and clinical questionnaire
as well as the IDATE, with the entire process taking
approximately 20 minutes to complete.
