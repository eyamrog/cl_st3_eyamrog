For the correlational analysis, Kendall's Tau-b test was employed to
evaluate the association between IDATE scores across both indices, as
well as to examine the strength of the correlation with
the variables age, period, and medication use. Additionally, the level
of agreement between IDATE-T and IDATE-E was assessed using the
Kappa (K) coefficient. All analyses were conducted with a 95%
confidence interval and a significance level set at p <
0.05.
