In the context of the Latin American region, two distinct
trends are evident. First, there was a notable increase in
the adoption of minimum wage legislation during the 1920s and
1930s. Second, there emerged a pattern of differentiating minimum wage
rates based on factors such as geographic location, the age
of workers, and their family or physical circumstances, including the
implementation of specific wage rates for individuals with disabilities and
for married women.
