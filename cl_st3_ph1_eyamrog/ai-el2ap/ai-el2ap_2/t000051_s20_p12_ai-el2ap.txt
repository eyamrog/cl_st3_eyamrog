The primary theme of Scholz’s initial course of action is
support for Ukraine, which now encompasses the delivery of arms
to a conflict zone—an activity that has previously been considered
taboo in Germany. This development can be identified as part
of the discourse positioning Germany as a military power, specifically
at the level of the proximal not-yet-articulated. Scholz invokes the
concept of a watershed moment (“in einer neuen Zeit,” or
“in a new era”), which constructs a “neue Realität” (“new
reality”) to substantiate the necessity of the policy shift regarding
arms deliveries to conflict zones. Potential disagreement is preempted by
framing the decision as unavoidable, as indicated by the dialogically
contractive denial “konnte es keine andere Antwort geben” (“there could
be no other response”).
