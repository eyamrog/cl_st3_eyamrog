This segment of the population was engaged in a labor
system derived from the Huasipungo, which involved the rental of
land for agricultural production and served as a primary means
of subsistence for families and communities. The concertaje system was
commonly practiced in rural areas, particularly in the Ecuadorian highlands,
and contributed to the economic isolation of these regions from
both local and international markets. As a result, this portion
of the economically active population was largely excluded from broader
patterns of domestic consumption and commercial exchange, as they primarily
exchanged goods among themselves and were consumers of the same
products that they cultivated or traded.
