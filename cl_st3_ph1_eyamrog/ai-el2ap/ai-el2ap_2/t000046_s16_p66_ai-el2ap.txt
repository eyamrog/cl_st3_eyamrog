In Doña, Jiménez, and Gálvez (2014), who examined the official
physical education (PE) curriculum proposed in Chile, the authors introduce
a narrative advocating for a critical approach to PE, comparable
to movements in Brazil after the 1980s that aimed to
address and challenge social inequalities. However, their findings indicate that
the improvement of movement quality remains one of the predominant
curricular objectives. This reveals a tension between traditional and critical
perspectives within the curriculum, which may contribute to distancing school
physical education from a health-oriented approach.
