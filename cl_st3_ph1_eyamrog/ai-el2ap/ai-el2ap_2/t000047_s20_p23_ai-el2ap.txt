HLMA1 presents the Oral-B Institute, social actors, and a toilet
as the primary elements of the communication setting, accompanied by
the statement, "You clean your toilet every day." This comparison
suggests that both toilets and teeth require daily cleaning to
maintain hygiene and prevent unpleasant odors. The advertisement encourages viewers
to use Oral-B specifically, rather than alternative products, to achieve
strong and healthy breath. According to the advertisement, Oral-B provides
users with long-lasting fresh breath for up to 14 hours.
The advertisement employs visual cues such as a sagittal head
movement, the act of holding a toothbrush, and the use
of the right hand to reinforce and persuade viewers. The
presence of two social actors, identified as dentists, further supports
the product's credibility; Social Actor 2 explicitly endorses the cleaning
efficacy of Oral-B, while both actors collaborate to promote the
product in a coordinated manner.
