In general, both logistical and structural factors have made prosthetic
rehabilitation for this population particularly challenging, primarily due to the
difficulties associated with transporting patients from villages to urban centers
for treatment. Although DSEI Bahia has established Primary Oral Health
teams in all villages, dental prosthetic services are not available.
In Aldeia Velha, despite its proximity to urban centers, older
adults do not leave the village to seek prosthetic rehabilitation.
