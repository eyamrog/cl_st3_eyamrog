An association was observed between the type of university and
the use of anxiolytic drugs. Female students demonstrated a higher
prevalence of anxiolytic drug use, which is consistent with findings
from other national studies (Aquino et al., 2010; BojaniÄ‡ et
al., 2021; Souza et al., 2022). This pattern may be
partially explained by the greater exposure of women to medicalization
throughout their lives, a higher frequency of seeking medical care,
and the presence of educational campaigns that are more frequently
targeted toward women (Forster et al., 2019). Conversely, the lower
percentage of male participants may be related to the tendency
of men to be less likely to seek assistance for
mental health concerns (Souza et al., 2022).
