The implementation of minimum wage legislation occurred alongside the rise
of populist governments, which used the economic crisis of 1929
to attribute responsibility to the dominant northern countries. During this
period, many governments sought electoral support from the general population
by proposing policies that provided benefits to workers and employees,
as exemplified by leaders such as Lázaro Cárdenas in Mexico
(1934–1940), Getulio Vargas in Brazil (1930–1943), and Juan Domingo Perón
in Argentina (1943–1955) (Zapata 2002). In Ecuador, these legal changes
took place in the context of the Julian Revolution (1925–1932)
and the emergence of the first populist administration under Velasco
Ibarra (1934–1935).
