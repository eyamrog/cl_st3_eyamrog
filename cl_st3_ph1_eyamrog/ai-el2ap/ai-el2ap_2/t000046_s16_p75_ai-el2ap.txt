In summary, we concur with Bracht (2013) regarding the importance
of pedagogical approaches that emphasize attentive listening and the development
of interpersonal connections, which facilitate students' exposure to concepts of
well-being and happiness. Such approaches can help clarify pathways to
health through engagement in bodily practices, positioning health as a
consequence of individual choices and actions. This perspective is supported
by Carmo JÃºnior (2011, p. 365), who asserts that the
body and the world constitute a unified structure, and that
this relationship becomes apparent only when sensory experiences are integrated,
requiring a consideration of the world from diverse perspectives. Therefore,
we maintain that students participate in educational settings to engage
with pedagogical interventions, and that these interactions should promote meaningful
learning, specifically in relation to health, as examined in our
study.
