Attitude is categorized into three dimensions: affect, which refers to
the emotive aspect of meaning and encompasses reactions to behavior;
judgement, which pertains to the ethical or moral dimension and
involves the evaluation of behavior according to established norms; and
appreciation, which relates to the aesthetic dimension and involves the
evaluation of texts, processes, or phenomena (Martin & White, 2005,
pp. 42â€“44). These dimensions of attitude can be understood as
institutionalized expressions of feeling that reflect shared community values rather
than individual, everyday perspectives (Martin & White, 2005, p. 45).
Judgement typically invokes explicit or implicit rules or regulations and
reformulates feelings as proposals regarding behavior, while appreciation involves the
evaluation of semiotic and natural phenomena, reformulating feelings as propositions
about the value of objects or events (Martin & White,
2005, p. 45). The categories of appreciation and judgement are
not entirely distinct but rather overlap, with affect functioning as
a more personal evaluative component within both (see Martin &
White, 2005, p. 45).
