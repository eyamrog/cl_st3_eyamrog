A second important consideration is the need to enhance the
understanding of brokerage dynamics by distinguishing between the electoral campaign
period and the period following elections. This distinction has been
largely neglected in the existing literature, which frequently bases its
theoretical propositions about brokers on observations derived primarily from campaign-related
activities, thereby potentially overemphasizing the electoral aspects of brokerage. In
our study, interviewees commonly minimized the significance of the election
period when attributing credit for their actions, indicating that brokerage
is perceived as a continuous and sustained activity rather than
one confined to electoral cycles. Although some studies have acknowledged
the role of brokers beyond elections and their involvement in
outcomes such as the implementation of public works and social
policies (Auyero, 2000; Zarazaga, 2014; Hoyler, Gelape, and Silotto, 2021),
further research is required to clarify the distinctions and interconnections
between brokerage activities during and outside of electoral periods.
