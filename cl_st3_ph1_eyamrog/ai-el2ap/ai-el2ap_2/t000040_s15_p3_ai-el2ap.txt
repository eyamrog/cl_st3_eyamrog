In contrast to periapical radiographs, panoramic two-dimensional X-rays provide a
comprehensive view of the entire oral cavity, allowing for clear
visualization of the mandibular canal (MC) among various other anatomical
structures (Figure 1). Liu et al. classified the course of
the MC into four distinct curve types: (a) linear, (b)
arc-elliptic, (c) spoon-shaped, and (d) turning [26].
