Effective communication reduces anxiety, misunderstandings, and uncertainty, contributing to the
satisfaction of both patients and dental professionals. This factor likely
contributed to the outcomes observed in the present study, as
all participating dentists were members of the indigenous oral health
team and therefore had experience working with indigenous patients, which
may have enhanced the professional-patient relationship.
