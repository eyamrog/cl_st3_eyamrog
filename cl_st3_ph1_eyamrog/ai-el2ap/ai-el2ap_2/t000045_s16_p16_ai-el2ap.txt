In some instances, legislators combine a regional approach—characterized by reliance
on mayors and municipal leaders—with thematic activities or engagement with
specific sectors. In cases where legislators focus on thematic or
sectoral work, interviewees generally attributed less significance to regional activities
and to the role of mayors as intermediaries. Evidence of
this reduced emphasis is illustrated by a legislator who actively
advocates for the interests of a particular group; she does
not maintain a regional office and employs only one paid
assistant in her hometown.
