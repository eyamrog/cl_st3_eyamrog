The 1930s were characterized by political and economic events that
significantly transformed the institutional structure of Ecuador and served as
the basis for a broader process of modernization observed throughout
Latin America. The international economic crisis, particularly the Great Depression,
had a substantial impact on the country's economic stability, with
pronounced effects on the export sectors. This period of economic
turmoil contributed to considerable political instability; in Ecuador, twelve individuals
held the position of head of the executive branch within
a span of less than ten years during the 1930s.
