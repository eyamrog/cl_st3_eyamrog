The results of this study indicate that slightly more than
half of the university students in health-related fields reported using
anxiolytic medication. The prevalence of anxiolytic use was higher among
female students and those enrolled in public universities. Additionally, the
findings demonstrate that a substantial proportion of students with high
trait anxiety and those with moderate state anxiety reported using
anxiolytic medications. These results enhance the understanding of anxiety-related symptoms
within this population and underscore the relevance of employing the
State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (IDATE) as a screening tool for identifying
anxious symptoms among university students.
