The results of the present study, which account for the
time interval between training sessions and matches, are consistent with
the time-to-event paradigm described by Hagan et al. (2017b), wherein
such events significantly influence variations in Present Mood States, in
addition to the impact of match outcomes. Although the primary
objective of this study was not to examine match outcomes,
the discussion of the results considers that the participant team
was defeated in all matches.
