The presence values of Factors IV (Limerence/Empathy) and VII (Interest)
exhibited distinct patterns of change in response to a series
of events, as indicated by the mean presence values of
PMSL Factors associated with the same match. Specifically, the mean
presence values for Factors IV and VII declined once the
probability of advancing to the next championship phase became unlikely
(between Series 1 and 2 matches), with the team being
eliminated from the competition after the second match and participating
in subsequent matches solely to fulfill fixture requirements. The observed
relationship between these factors in this context can be interpreted
through the interaction between group cohesion (Lafferty et al., 2017)
and achievement goals (Mascret et al., 2015). The elimination from
the competition may have negatively impacted group cohesion, which could
account for the decreased value of Factor IV (Limerence/Empathy). Overall,
these findings indicate that, despite the unfavorable competitive context, mood
states associated with these PMSL Factors are typically present in
the experience of competitive team sports.
