The Unidimensional Congruence index (UniCo = 0.918) indicated that the
data cannot be considered essentially unidimensional (Ferrando & Lorenzo-Seva, 2018).
However, the Explained Common Variance (ECV = 0.85) met the
threshold, as values greater than 0.85 suggest that the data
may be treated as essentially unidimensional. Similarly, the Mean of
Item Residual Absolute Loadings (MIREAL = 0.200), which is below
the recommended cutoff of 0.300, also supports the assumption of
essential unidimensionality. Furthermore, the fit indices evaluating the adequacy of
the factor structure demonstrated strong values, with a Root Mean
Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) of 0.067 and a Non-Normed
Fit Index (NNFI) of 0.976, indicating that the model provides
a satisfactory fit to the data.
