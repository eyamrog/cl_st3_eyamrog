The legislator operates within a highly hierarchical framework, maintaining the
view that the councilor should communicate her requests to the
mayor, who is then responsible for relaying them to this
office. However, this does not preclude the provision of assistance
to the councilor; such support is frequently extended, particularly when
the mayor is not affiliated with the same political group.
Conversely, when the mayor is aligned with this office, it
is considered unjustifiable to receive the councilor directly, as this
would be perceived as circumventing the authority of the executive
branch at the municipal level (Chief of Staff 4).
