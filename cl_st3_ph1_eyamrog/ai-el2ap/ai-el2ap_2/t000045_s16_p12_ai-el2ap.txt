With the exception of one respondent, all interviewees indicated that
the mayor’s support was important in the legislator’s most recent
election. According to the majority of participants, the significance of
mayors as political brokers is attributed to their high visibility
within the municipality, their political authority, and their executive capacity,
distinguishing them from other local officials such as councilors. Mayors
frequently function as gatekeepers, and their endorsement is often important,
and in some cases necessary, for representatives seeking access to
municipalities. This finding is consistent with the results reported by
Bezerra (1999) in his study of national representatives.
