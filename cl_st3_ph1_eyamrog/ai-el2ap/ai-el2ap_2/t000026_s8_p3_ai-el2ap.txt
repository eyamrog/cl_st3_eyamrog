Exposure to a challenging academic environment during training may increase
susceptibility to the development of anxiety, which can negatively impact
both academic performance and overall well-being among university students (Balapala
& Indla, 2017). Anxiety is defined as a mental state
characterized by restlessness and psychological disturbance, marked by symptoms such
as worry, avoidance behaviors, and heightened emotional reactivity or arousal,
which collectively contribute to an unrealistic and distressing emotional state
in affected individuals (Gama et al., 2021).
