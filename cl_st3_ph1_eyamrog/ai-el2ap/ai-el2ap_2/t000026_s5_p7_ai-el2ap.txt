In contrast, an international study by Nazir et al. (2021)
found that female university students exhibited significantly higher levels of
trait anxiety (M = 48.45, SD = 12.79, p <
0.001), whereas male students demonstrated significantly higher levels of state
anxiety (M = 41.85, SD = 8.91, p < 0.001).
Previous research indicates that trait anxiety among university students may
be associated with specific personality characteristics and a consistent predisposition
to experience anxiety in academic contexts (Bados et al., 2010;
Williams & Crawford, 2016).
