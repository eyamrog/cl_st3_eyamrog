The question of what constitutes a "mode" remains pertinent. According
to van Leeuwen (2005), a mode is an interactional resource
whose meaning potential is shaped by historical developments, current cultural
practices, and anticipated future norms. Jewitt (2009) further defines a
mode as a semiotic resource for meaning-making that is inherently
linked to cultural context, identifying examples such as images, writing,
gestures, and postures. Kress (2010) distinguishes between informal and formal
perspectives on modes, with the informal perspective emphasizing the social
dimension, wherein a community collectively determines the designation and relevance
of a mode. In this view, the effectiveness and significance
of a mode are influenced by the specific social group,
rendering modes contextually and geographically situated.
