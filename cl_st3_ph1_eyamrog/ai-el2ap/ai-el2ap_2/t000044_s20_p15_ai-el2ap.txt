Laburú, Silva, and Zômpero (2015) investigated high school students’ understanding
of electrostatics concepts through experimental activities, with the aim of
assessing their grasp of scientific concepts. The evaluation of students
during these activities revealed that certain concepts are not directly
observable, and students’ incomplete or incorrect understanding may indicate conceptual
unintelligibility. The researchers suggest that students’ difficulties may be attributed
to these specific elements rather than to the broader conceptual
framework itself. Furthermore, they argue that gestures serve as a
valuable tool for teachers to assess students’ comprehension of scientific
knowledge and play a fundamental role in the development of
students’ conceptual understanding.
