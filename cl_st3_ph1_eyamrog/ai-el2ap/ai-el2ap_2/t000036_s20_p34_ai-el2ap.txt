In the analysis of labor conditions, it is important to
consider the establishment of the minimum wage in Ecuador and
the broader Latin American region, as this development emerged as

labor rights and the implementation of minimum wage standards necessary
for subsistence. In Ecuador, the minimum wage was formally established
as a legal requirement in 1936.
