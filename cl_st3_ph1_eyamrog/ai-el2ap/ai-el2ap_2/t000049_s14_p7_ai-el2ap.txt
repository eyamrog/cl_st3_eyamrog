This educational approach is similar to the one previously described;
however, at the conclusion of the activities, the researcher prompts
the children to revisit and reflect on their experiences through
guided discussion. In this context, the adult facilitates discussion, critical
engagement, and reflection by posing specific questions such as: What
did we do today? What did we observe? How can
we continue the experience? The objective is to examine whether,
and in what ways, this method—where the adult not only
promotes learning from within but also encourages participatory reflection—affects the
development of scientific attitudes in children. Additionally, this approach seeks
to assess the influence of the metacognitive dimension on these
outcomes.
