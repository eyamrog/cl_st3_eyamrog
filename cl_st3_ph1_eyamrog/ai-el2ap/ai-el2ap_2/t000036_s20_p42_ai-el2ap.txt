In Argentina, Law 11.544 was enacted in 1929 to regulate
the length of the working day, establishing a maximum of
8 hours per day or 48 hours per week. In
1933, Law 11.723 introduced significant amendments for workers in the
commercial sector, including provisions for compensation and paid vacations. Subsequently,
in 1934, Law 11.933 established compulsory maternity leave, mandating leave
from 30 days prior to childbirth until 45 days after
(CÃ¡mara Argentina de Comercio y Servicios, 2018).
