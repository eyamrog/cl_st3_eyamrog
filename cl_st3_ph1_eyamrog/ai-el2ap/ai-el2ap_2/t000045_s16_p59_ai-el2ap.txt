In the assembly, legislators are typically identified by the regions
they represent. When a request is received from an individual
residing in a specific municipality, there is a reference guide
that allows staff to determine the appropriate regional representative and
advise the individual to contact that legislator. While it is
sometimes possible to assist individuals from outside the designated region,
such cases are limited due to the high volume of
requests and the assemblyâ€™s capacity constraints (Chief of Staff 8).
