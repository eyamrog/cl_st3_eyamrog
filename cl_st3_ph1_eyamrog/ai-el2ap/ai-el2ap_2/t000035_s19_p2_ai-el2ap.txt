The mean duration of edentulism among the rehabilitated patients in
the sample was 15.3 years (Â± 15.3). As shown in
Table 1, all patients reported tooth decay as the primary
cause of tooth loss. The most frequently reported difficulties associated
with missing teeth were problems with eating and smiling. Financial
constraints were the most commonly cited reason for not using
dentures. The most frequently expressed expectations regarding the provision of
dentures in the village were improvements in the ability to
smile and to chew.
