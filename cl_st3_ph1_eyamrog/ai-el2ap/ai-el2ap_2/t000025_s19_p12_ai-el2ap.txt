Foam with Ibuprofen was recommended as a dressing for malignant
fungating wound (MFW) pain management in eight out of seventy
studies (10%). The majority of these studies were non-systematic reviews
(87.5%), with the remainder being surveys (12.5%). None of the
studies specifically evaluated the effectiveness of foam with Ibuprofen for
MFW-related pain management; rather, they referenced it as a potential
dressing option. Furthermore, no study provided details regarding the application
method or reported outcomes associated with its use.
