This study forms part of the ongoing floristic survey of
the Núcleo Curucutu, a significant yet relatively understudied region within
the municipality of São Paulo (Garcia & Pirani 2005), conducted
in collaboration with the Universidade Santo Amaro and the Herbarium
PMSP. Previous research on monocotyledons in this area has included
studies on the families Iridaceae (Takeuchi et al. 2008) and
Orchidaceae (Rosa & Affonso 2009).
