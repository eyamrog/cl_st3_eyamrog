To identify broader trends in the relationships between state legislators
and their brokers, we analyze data from two waves of
a survey conducted by the Center for Legislative Studies (CEL/DCP/UFMG)
in twelve Brazilian states, which included responses from 513 state
representatives in 2007 and 439 in 2012. While the data
are not nationally representative and therefore not generalizable to the
entire country, they enable the construction of a broader overview
of these relationships within Brazil. Additionally, we conducted ten in-depth
interviews with chiefs of staff and advisors to nine state
legislators from a single state. These interviews provide supplementary evidence
addressing the same research questions outlined at the beginning of
this section, which are also examined using the quantitative survey
data.
