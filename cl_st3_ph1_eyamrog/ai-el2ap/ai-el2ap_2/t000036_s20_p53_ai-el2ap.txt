In all cases, underage workers were compensated at a rate
equivalent to half the salary of adult workers. Positions involving
hazardous or extremely poor working conditions were compensated at one
and a half times the standard salary. Furthermore, any employment
in which the wage paid was below the established minimum
wage was annulled, and employers were required to pay the
difference for the duration of employment.
