In evidence synthesis, the critical appraisal of included studies is
essential for assessing the credibility of the findings, which depends
on the methodological rigor employed. Critical appraisal also facilitates the
evaluation of the transparency and reproducibility of the published evidence.
The absence of critical appraisal poses a barrier to users
of the evidence, as it impedes the ability to interpret
research findings in light of the strengths and weaknesses of
the studies under consideration (17,18).
