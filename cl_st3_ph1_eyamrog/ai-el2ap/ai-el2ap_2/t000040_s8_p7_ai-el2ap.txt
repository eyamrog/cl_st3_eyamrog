The bifurcation of the mandibular canal (MC) has been examined
by several researchers using various radiographic methods. Nortje et al.
[11] and Langlais et al. [12] utilized panoramic radiographs and
reported prevalences of bifid MC of 0.91% (33 out of
3612 cases) and 0.95% (57 out of 6000 cases), respectively.
