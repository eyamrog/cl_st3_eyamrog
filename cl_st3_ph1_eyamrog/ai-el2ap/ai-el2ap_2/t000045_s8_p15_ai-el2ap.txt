One of the primary mechanisms through which representatives can support
their constituencies and local politicians is the allocation of resources
via pork barrel budget amendments, typically in response to requests
from mayors and other local stakeholders (Bezerra, 1999; Carvalho, 2003,
p. 152). Another significant mechanism involves providing allies with information
and facilitating access to government agencies, particularly within the Executive
branch, as well as assisting them in addressing bureaucratic challenges.
Legislators report that the amount of resources directed to municipalities
constitutes the principal criterion by which local leaders assess their
performance (Bezerra, 1999). Although representatives frequently express reservations regarding these
activities, they often justify their engagement with local issues by
citing voter expectations, a finding supported by Ricci and Lemos
(2011) through surveys conducted with national representatives.
