Twenty-six articles (37.1%) recommended non-adherent dressings for the management of
pain associated with malignant fungating wounds (MFWs). The included studies
comprised non-systematic reviews (65.3%), case studies (19.8%), randomized clinical trials
(3.8%), a guideline (3.8%), prospective cohort studies (3.8%), and a
survey (3.8%). In 25 studies (35.7%), pain management was not
identified as a primary objective. All studies reported the use
of non-adherent dressings in combination with other therapies, such as
opioids, anesthetics, and antiseptics. None of the studies described a
standardized protocol for the use of non-adherent dressings or reported
pain-specific outcomes attributable to non-adherent dressings alone.
