The Anxiety Trait-State Inventory (IDATE), developed by Spielberger et al.
(1970) and validated for use in Brazil by Biaggio and
Natalício (1979), is a psychometric instrument with a reported Cronbach's
alpha coefficient ranging from 0.86 to 0.95 (Spielberger et al.,
1980). The instrument comprises two scales, each containing 20 items,
for a total of 40 items, and utilizes a four-point
Likert response format ranging from "4-very much" to "1-absolutely not."
The first scale assesses state anxiety (IDATE-E), while the second
assesses trait anxiety (IDATE-T) (Grös et al., 2007). In the
present study, the instrument demonstrated a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.85,
indicating satisfactory internal consistency.
