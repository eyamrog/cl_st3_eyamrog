In 1937, legislation established a minimum wage for the commercial
and industrial sectors. The minimum monthly wage was set at
140 bolivianos, with no distinction based on gender. For workers
classified as older adults, the minimum wage was set at
five bolivianos per day, while for workers aged 14 to
18 years, the minimum wage was three bolivianos per day.
This regulation excluded agricultural sector workers whose total assets did
not exceed 50,000 bolivianos.
