ABA Farm is situated in a region identified by MMA
(2002) as having high biological importance within the Caatinga biome,
specifically within the Aba mountain complex, which is named after
the river that traverses this geological formation. The area encompasses
a variety of phytophysiognomies, including mountains reaching elevations of up
to 800 meters, as well as dense, well-preserved tree-shrub caatinga
associated with riparian forests, rupicolous flora, and open fields. Within
this landscape, riparian forests, open fields containing exotic species, and
montane vegetation are present (MMA 2002).
