municipal school with the largest student population in Fortaleza, Cear√°,
Brazil, Ferreira, Oliveira, and Sampaio (2013) identified physical exercise as
a significant factor contributing to well-being. The findings indicate that
the teachers perceive a causal relationship between physical activity and
health, often using the terms interchangeably in their discourse.
