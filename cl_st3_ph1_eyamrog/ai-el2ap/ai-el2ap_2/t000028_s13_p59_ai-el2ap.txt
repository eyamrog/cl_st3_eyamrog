As described in the previous section, activities from the Vocabulary
Corner, which address vocabulary covered throughout the textbook, were selected
for adaptation. To enhance the appeal and accessibility of these
activities for blind students, ludic approaches were employed to facilitate
meaningful and engaging interaction among all students, including both blind
and sighted individuals. Consequently, the adaptations presented do not emphasize
written vocabulary, but rather focus on the recognition and understanding
of English words and their meanings within relevant contexts.
