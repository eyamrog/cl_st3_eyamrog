Goeppertia monophylla is capable of forming large populations, with group
sizes exceeding 30 individuals (Saka 2016). This phenomenon was observed
in the NÃºcleo Curucutu. According to Saka (2016), the species
may produce flowers that are purple, grayish-white, or pale yellow;
in the present study, only the latter two flower colorations
were observed.
