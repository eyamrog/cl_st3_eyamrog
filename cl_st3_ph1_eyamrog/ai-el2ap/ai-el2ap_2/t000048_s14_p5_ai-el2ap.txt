For the analysis and identification of the samples, relevant specialized
literature was consulted (Maas 1977; Santos 1978; Forzza & Wanderley
1999; Catharino 2002; Kamer & Maas 2003; Souza et al.
2007; Wongsuwan & Picheansoonthon 2011; Vieira et al. 2012; Saka
2016), as well as the Zingiberales collections of the PMSP,
SPF, and SPSF herbaria. Additionally, virtual herbaria, including BHCB, CEPEC,
E, FURB, HUFU, IBGE, ICN, JBRJ, K, MBM, NY, P/PC,
R, RB, UPCB, and S (herbarium acronyms follow Thiers, continuously
updated), were consulted to support the identification process.
