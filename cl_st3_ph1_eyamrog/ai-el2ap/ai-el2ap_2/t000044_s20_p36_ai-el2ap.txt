Goldin-Meadow (2018) suggests that gesture has the potential to enhance
learning outcomes for all children and may contribute to reducing
disparities in language and mathematics performance. Additionally, gesture can serve
as a tool for teachers to gain insight into students'
cognitive processes and to assess the extent of their understanding
by analyzing the integration of speech and gesture during classroom
interactions.
