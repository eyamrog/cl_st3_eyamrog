Two Ministers of Health, Luiz Henrique Mandetta and Nelson Teich,
were removed from their positions on April 16 and May
15, 2020, respectively, after both advocated for additional studies before
approving hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a treatment for COVID-19. Following Teich’s
resignation, President Bolsonaro appointed active-duty Army General Eduardo Pazuello, who
lacked prior experience in healthcare, as the new Minister of
Health and filled the Ministry with military personnel expected to
comply with his directives. Upon Pazuello’s appointment, the number of
confirmed COVID-19 cases in Brazil surpassed one million, making it
the country with the second highest case count globally after
the United States. In contrast to World Health Organization (WHO)
recommendations, Pazuello discontinued contact tracing policies, limited testing to hospitalized
patients, and prioritized HCQ as the primary pharmaceutical intervention. Both
Pazuello and Bolsonaro exerted pressure on ANVISA, the independent Health
Regulatory Agency, to authorize the use of chloroquine imported from
India for COVID-19 treatment, and directed the army laboratory to
produce over one million chloroquine tablets within a few weeks.
Additionally, Bolsonaro attempted to restrict public access to information on
COVID-19 fatalities by reporting only new daily case numbers rather
than death counts.
