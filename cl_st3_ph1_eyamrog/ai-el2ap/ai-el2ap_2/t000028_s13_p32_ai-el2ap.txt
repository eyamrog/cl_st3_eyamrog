These methodological strategies exemplify approaches to effectively support the education
of blind students in the classroom. They help to prevent
issues related to non-inclusion, limited autonomy, and insufficient teacher preparedness,
as well as other previously identified barriers that may hinder
the studentâ€™s learning process. Nevertheless, ongoing communication with the student
remains essential to determine their preferred learning methods and to
ensure optimal comprehension of the material (Uliana, 2013; Ferreira &
Dickman, 2015). This collaborative process enables both the teacher and
the student to identify and implement instructional methods that are
mutually effective.
