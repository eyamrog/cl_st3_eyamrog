This conceptualization of dialogue can be applied to discourse studies.
Appraisal Theory employs a dialogic perspective to analyze how language
positions the writer or speaker in relation to the value
positions referenced in the text, as well as in relation
to the range of alternative opinions, viewpoints, and value judgments
that, according to Bakhtin, form the context within which all
texts are produced (Martin & White, 2005, p. 94). A
key advantage of adopting a Bakhtinian dialogic perspective is its
capacity to identify the status of "bare assertions," or monoglossic
discourse, which does not explicitly acknowledge other voices, alternative positions,
or competing discourses (Baxter, 2011, p. 127; Martin & White,
2005, p. 99). Monoglossic discourse is characterized by its presentation
as an indivisible and authoritative statement, which is positioned as
self-evident and invites either complete acceptance or rejection.
