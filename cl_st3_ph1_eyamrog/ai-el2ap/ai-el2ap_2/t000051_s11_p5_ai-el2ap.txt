Dialogism is a central concept in Bakhtin’s work, and he
employed the term in multiple senses (Morson & Emerson, 1990,
pp. 130–131). In general, Bakhtin regards all utterances as dialogic
in that they are inherently responsive to previous statements and
anticipate future responses, thereby situating each utterance within a broader
communicative context.
