We assessed model fit using the Root Mean Square Error
of Approximation (RMSEA), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), and Comparative Fit Index
(CFI). Based on the criteria outlined by Brown (2015), an
acceptable model fit is indicated by RMSEA values below 0.08,
with confidence intervals not exceeding 0.10, and by TLI and
CFI values greater than 0.90, with values above 0.95 considered
preferable.
