In this context, Social Actor 2 holds a carton of
Oral-B toothpaste in the left hand and makes contact with
Social Actor 1 using the right hand. This interaction is
facilitated by the fact that Social Actor 1 is now
presented as a highly qualified dentist, recognized for endorsing the
specific qualities and value associated with the toothpaste. This professional
qualification influences Social Actor 1, as demonstrated in instances O-BT13
to O-BT18, to raise the left hand and place it
on the shoulder of Social Actor 2. This gesture indicates
the perceived reliability of the information that Social Actor 2
communicates to Social Actor 1 regarding the long-lasting fresh breath
provided by Oral-B. Consequently, Social Actor 1 is depicted as
willing to associate with Social Actor 2, perceiving the product
as valuable.
