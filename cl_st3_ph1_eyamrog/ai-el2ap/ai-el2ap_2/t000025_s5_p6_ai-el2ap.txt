Non-adherent dressings, including polyurethane foam, silicone foams, silicone hydrocellular foam,
fibers, and hydrofibers, have been recommended to facilitate painless removal.
However, the optimal non-adherent dressing for malignant fungating wounds (MFWs)
remains unclear, particularly due to variations in local circulation and
the presence of non-viable tissue. Absorbent dressings have also been
identified as relevant for managing pain associated with MFWs, specifically
addressing pain resulting from periwound dermatitis caused by excessive exudation
and the irritating components within the exudate (Gozzo et al.,
2014; Tamai et al., 2016a).
