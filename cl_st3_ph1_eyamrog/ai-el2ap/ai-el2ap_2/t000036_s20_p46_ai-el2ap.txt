Although the lowest-paying jobs were associated with the production of
short underpants, workers in this category were also engaged in
the manufacture of other textile products. Consequently, this group was
not identified as having the lowest overall income within the
sector. Additionally, while the standard work month was officially set
at 25 days, the actual number of days worked per
month varied depending on the specific productive sector. In 1945,
Decree 1740, issued by Secretary of Labor and Social Welfare
Juan Domingo Per√≥n, extended the right to paid vacations to
workers across all sectors.
