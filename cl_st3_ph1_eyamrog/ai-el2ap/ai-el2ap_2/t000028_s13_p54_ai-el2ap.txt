The following activity focuses on animals and includes images with
blank spaces where students are required to write the names
of the animals, as covered in Unit 7. The final
two exercises address the vocabulary from Unit 8, specifically colors
and abilities, and both tasks require students to write the
appropriate words beneath the corresponding images.
