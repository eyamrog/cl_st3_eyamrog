Although Modi and Bolsonaro adopted different approaches to lockdowns, both
relied on radical assumptions regarding herd immunity that were informed
by perspectives which marginalized significant segments of their populations. The
application of the herd immunity concept entailed significant necropolitical implications,
as it implied that the deaths of large numbers of
individuals deemed "expendable" were both necessary and acceptable. The groups
most adversely affected included Amazonian Indigenous peoples and poor Afro-Brazilians
in Brazil, as well as Muslim minorities, Dalits, and migrant
workers in India. Both the Brazilian and Indian federal governments
promoted vaccines as a rapid solution, without addressing the underlying
issues related to basic living conditions. This approach reflected an
initially implicit necropolitical stance by the state, which, as case
and mortality numbers declined, became normalized. As a result, political
responses to the COVID-19 crisis not only failed to address
but also contributed to the ongoing invisibilization of entrenched patterns
of racism and discrimination.
