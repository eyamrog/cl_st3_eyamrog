The self-controlled case series (SCCS) design is appropriate for analyzing
both independent recurrent events and rare non-recurrent events. Key assumptions
underlying the applicability of the SCCS method include the rarity
of observed events, the requirement that the occurrence of an
event does not influence the probability of subsequent exposure (i.e.,
events should be independent if they are consecutive), and that
the occurrence of the event of interest does not censor
or otherwise affect the observation period. Additionally, the observation period
for each individual must be independent of the timing of
events. This latter assumption may be violated in cases where
death occurs (1,2,4,5,7).
