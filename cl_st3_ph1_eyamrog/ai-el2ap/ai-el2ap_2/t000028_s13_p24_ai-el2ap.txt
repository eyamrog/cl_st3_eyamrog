Using this methodology, the researchers were able to more closely
examine the perspectives of both teachers and students in the
process of reformulating and developing materials or didactic resources that
facilitate greater inclusion of blind students. Simultaneously, this approach enabled
the adaptation of methodological procedures to make curricular content more
accessible to teachers (FERREIRA; DICKMAN, 2015, p. 256).
