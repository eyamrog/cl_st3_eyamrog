The Caatinga is characterized by a semi-arid climate, supporting vegetation
mosaics predominantly composed of deciduous, xerophilous, and spiny plant species,
with rainfall that is irregularly distributed and typically confined to
a period of three to six months (IBGE 2004; Silva
et al. 2017). In the Northern backland depression, precipitation is
more concentrated compared to other areas of the Caatinga, with
annual rainfall ranging from 500 to 800 mm (Veloso et
al. 2002).
