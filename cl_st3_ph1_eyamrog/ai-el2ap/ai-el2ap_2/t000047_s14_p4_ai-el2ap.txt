Specifically, Bloor and Bloorâ€™s (2013) analysis of the mood system
provides a framework for examining written modes. By applying various
social semiotic concepts, the study identifies instances of spoken modes
and the kinesic functions of images, as presented in the
results section. The reported frequencies reveal the functional patterns of
certain modes within the communication. Abbreviations such as S (subject),
F (finite), P (predicator), C (complement), A (adjunct), and CL
(clause) are employed for reasons of textual economy (Dalamu, 2019a).
