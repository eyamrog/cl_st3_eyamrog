According to the interviewees, state representatives typically collaborate with national
representatives, most frequently forming partnerships with individuals from different parties
but the same region. The data suggest a division of
labor that benefits all parties involved: national legislators are able
to allocate larger financial resources to municipalities through budget amendments,
while state representatives maintain closer contact with the region and
its voters. In one case from our sample, there was
evidence of a near-complete integration between the offices of a
state legislator and her national counterpart, who, in this instance,
belonged to the same political party.
