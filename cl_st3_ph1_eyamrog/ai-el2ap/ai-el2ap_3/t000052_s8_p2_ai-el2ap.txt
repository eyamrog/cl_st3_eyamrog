The fish fauna of Lake Tanganyika has been a focal
point for evolutionary biologists, primarily due to the remarkable phenotypic,
behavioral, and genetic diversity of its cichlid species, which has
led to the lake being regarded as a 'natural laboratory'
(Martens 1997; Langenberg et al. 2003; Albrecht & Wilke 2008;
Cristescu et al. 2010). The cichlid assemblage of Lake Tanganyika
exhibits the highest degree of endemism among the African and
American Great Lakes, with 239 of the 241 described species
being endemic, corresponding to an endemism rate of 99% (Nishida
1991; Salzburger et al. 2002, 2005, 2014; Ronco et al.
2020, 2021). In addition to evolutionary studies, Lake Tanganyika cichlids
have also been extensively investigated by parasitologists, particularly in the
contexts of host biogeography, systematics, and parasite evolution (Bates 1997;
Gr√©goir et al. 2014; Pariselle et al. 2011, 2015; Raeymaekers
et al. 2013; Steenberge et al. 2015; Vanhove et al.
2013, 2015, 2016).
