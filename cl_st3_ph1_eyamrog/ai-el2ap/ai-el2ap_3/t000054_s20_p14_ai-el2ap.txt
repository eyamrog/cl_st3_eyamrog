The concession prompted numerous complaints from indigenous communities and resulted
in an international lawsuit led by the Coordinator of Indigenous
Organizations of the Amazon Basin (COICA). Following several years of
legal proceedings, the patent was withdrawn in 1999, not as
a direct result of the claims made by indigenous groups,
but because it was determined that a specimen of the
plant had already been held at the Chicago Museum prior
to the patent application. In 2001, Miller submitted additional documentation
and succeeded in having the patent reinstated until its expiration
in 2003, although the rights granted were limited to the
genome of the plant and its asexual propagules (Beyer 2008).
