Identification. This species is characterized by small, cespitose basidiomata and
the presence of a white to yellowish subiculum that extends
across the substrate, which is typically decomposing wood (Baseia et
al. 2003). Phylogenetic analyses have demonstrated that some specimens previously
identified as G. schweinitzii in the Neotropics represent distinct species,
suggesting that G. schweinitzii may be endemic to the region
where the type material was originally collected (Accioly et al.
2019).
