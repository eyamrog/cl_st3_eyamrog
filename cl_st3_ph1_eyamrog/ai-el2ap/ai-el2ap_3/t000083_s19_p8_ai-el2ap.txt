The MANOVA results indicated significant differences in the factors across
the four levels of selfitis intensity (low, mild, moderate, severe),
as evidenced by Wilks’ λ = 0.421, F(15, 981) =
39.32, p < 0.001. The mean differences for each individual
factor at each intensity level, as determined by ANOVA, are
presented in Table 4. Effect sizes were calculated using partial
eta-squared (η²), which indicated moderate to large effects according to
Cohen’s (1988) criteria. Among the factors, "attention seeking" exhibited the
greatest variation across the four levels of selfie intensity, followed
by "social competition," "mood and confidence," "subjective conformity," and "environmental
enhancement."
