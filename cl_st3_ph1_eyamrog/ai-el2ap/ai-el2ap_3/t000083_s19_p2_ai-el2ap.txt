The process of translation and cross-cultural adaptation was conducted appropriately,
with a focus on ensuring both semantic and conceptual equivalence
of the items, as confirmed by the back-translation of the
scale. Operational equivalence was also maintained, as the scale was
administered online with the same number of questions and identical
response options, consistent with the methodologies used in previous studies
(Balakrishnan and Griffiths, 2017; Lin et al., 2019). In the
online pilot study, participants were asked to rate the clarity
and comprehensibility of each item and were provided with an
open field for suggestions. Analysis of the responses indicated that
no suggestions for modification were offered, and all participants reported
that the items were clear and easy to understand. These
findings support the face validity of the scale, as no
difficulties in comprehension or recommendations for improvement were identified by
the adolescent participants, thereby confirming the adequacy of the cross-cultural
adaptation. Consequently, the scale was deemed appropriate for use in
larger samples (Balakrishnan and Griffiths, 2017).
