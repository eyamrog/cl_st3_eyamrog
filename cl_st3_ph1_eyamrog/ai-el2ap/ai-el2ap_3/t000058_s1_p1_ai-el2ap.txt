Biological collections play a critical role in advancing knowledge of
biodiversity within specific environments. In this study, we organized, listed,
and catalogued adult specimens of the family Culicidae housed in
the Parasitology Collection of the Basic Pathology Department at the
Federal University of Paran치, southern Brazil. A database was developed
to record taxonomic and collection data for each specimen. The
culicids were collected using various methodologies across 18 municipalities in
the state of Paran치 between 1967 and 1999. The collection
comprises 5,739 catalogued specimens, of which 4,704 (81.96%) have been
identified to the species level, representing 205 species. Among these,
18 species are newly recorded for the state of Paran치
and 3 for Brazil. In recognition of three decades of
research on culicids in Paran치, we propose the establishment of
the Ana Leuch Lozovei Entomological Collection, which will include insect
vectors or potential vectors of human disease agents.
