This section reviews previous studies that have utilized CorIFA in
their research. Over the past six years, since its inception,
the corpus has served as a valuable linguistic resource for
Brazilian researchers. To date, research has primarily focused on describing
learner language and comparing learners’ written interlanguage with data from
other corpora through Contrastive Interlanguage Analysis (CIA), as discussed in
Section 2. These studies predominantly analyze two academic genres—argumentative essays
and abstracts—to examine learners’ use of English across different proficiency
levels and to identify patterns of underuse or overuse of
specific linguistic features. Most investigations employ a reference corpus consisting
of either well-rated non-native speakers’ essays or native speakers’ texts.
The linguistic features examined include linking adverbials, collocations, that-clauses, conjunctions,
noun phrases, and passive constructions. For clarity, this section first
presents an overview of one descriptive study and five studies
employing the CIA approach, and concludes with a CorIFA-based study
that investigates a pedagogical intervention, offering insights into the practical
applications of learner corpus research.
