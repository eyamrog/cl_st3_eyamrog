Mainstream research on capital accounts has undergone significant changes over
the past three decades. Initially, theoretical models supported full capital
account liberalization; however, the financial crises affecting emerging markets in
the 1990s, followed by the global financial crisis in 2008,
revealed several shortcomings of financial globalization. Subsequently, the post-crisis period
generated new empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of regulatory measures.
In light of substantial evidence that contradicted earlier theoretical models,
several mainstream economists developed new frameworks that justify the use
of capital controls. The primary objective of this paper is
to examine the recent evolution of mainstream economic thought on
capital account liberalization and capital controls, with particular attention to
new empirical findings and theoretical developments. This paper argues that
these new mainstream models constitute a distinct phase in the
approach to regulating international capital flows.
