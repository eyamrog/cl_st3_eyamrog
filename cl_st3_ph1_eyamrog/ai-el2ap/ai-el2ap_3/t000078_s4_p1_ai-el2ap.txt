Theoretically, SBDs (Suburban Business Districts) concentrate economic activities that may
lead to spatial segregation due to rising land prices; however,
they can also contribute to reducing urban road congestion by
decreasing commuting times within the municipality. SBDs should not be
viewed solely as outcomes of firm location decisions driven by
agglomeration economies in an autonomous and independent manner. Instead, they
should be recognized as significant instruments of public urban policy
that can facilitate more efficient matching between workers and firms
in the labor market. For example, by reducing land taxes,
policymakers can incentivize firms to relocate outside the city center,
thereby increasing overall land value and contributing to a more
balanced distribution of land prices within the municipality.
