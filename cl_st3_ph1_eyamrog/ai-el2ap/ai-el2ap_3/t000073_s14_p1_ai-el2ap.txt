This checklist was compiled based on published records of gasteroid
fungi from Paraguay. The data extracted from the literature include
distribution by department (Figure 1), habitat and substrate information, and
detailed descriptions and remarks on the basidiomata. The current taxonomic
placement of each species is indicated according to previous publications,
and a brief summary of the most distinctive characteristics of
each species is provided. Classification and nomenclature follow the Mycobank
database (http://www.mycobank.org). Genera and species are listed alphabetically (Table 1),
and the authorities for the binomials, as well as author
names and spellings, are consistent with the database of Robert
et al. (2005).
