The specification of Equation 1 does not align with the
conventional approaches found in either the theoretical or empirical urban
economics literature. As noted by Hermann and Haddad (2005), studies
in this field typically employ either a linear or a
semi-logarithmic functional form for the hedonic price function. Therefore, the
estimation of Equation 1 will be conducted using both of
these functional forms.
