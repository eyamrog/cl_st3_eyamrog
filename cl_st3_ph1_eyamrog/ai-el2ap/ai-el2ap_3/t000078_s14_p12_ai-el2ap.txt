The Moranâ€™s I test is employed to assess the presence
of spatial dependence in the residuals of ordinary least squares
(OLS) models. This study adopts the empirical approach proposed by
Halleck Vega and Elhorst (2015), with particular attention to models
incorporating the spatial lag of explanatory variables (SLX). As noted
by Gibbons and Overman (2012) and Halleck Vega and Elhorst
(2015), the SLX model is recommended when a spatial econometric
framework is required. The SLX specification is considered the most
flexible among spatial econometric models; however, it is subject to
certain limitations, including potential multicollinearity and challenges in interpreting causality.
Despite these drawbacks, the SLX model offers straightforward interpretation regarding
the direction, magnitude, and statistical significance of effects. Furthermore, it
circumvents several criticisms associated with global spillover models, such as
the spatial Durbin model (SDM), spatial Durbin error model (SDEM),
or general nesting spatial (GNS) models, as discussed by Halleck
Vega and Elhorst (2015).
