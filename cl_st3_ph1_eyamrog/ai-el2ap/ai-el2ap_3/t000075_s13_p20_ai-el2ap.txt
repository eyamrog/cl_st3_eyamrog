Given that Brazil implemented the most extensive capital controls following
the global financial crisis, an analysis of this case provides
significant insights into the subject. In contrast to cross-country studies
that focus on the effectiveness and spillover effects of capital
controls, Forbes et al. (2016) specifically investigate whether Brazil’s controls
during 2006–2013 produced spillover effects on other economies, in addition
to their direct impact on the Brazilian capital account. The
regression analysis conducted by Forbes et al. (2016) indicates that
the introduction of the IOF tax during the sample period
led to a reduction in institutional investors’ holdings of the
asset class targeted by the controls, particularly fixed income instruments.
Furthermore, the results show that the reduction in investor positions
was even more pronounced in certain equity classes, suggesting heightened
investor caution in response to the government’s capital control measures.
