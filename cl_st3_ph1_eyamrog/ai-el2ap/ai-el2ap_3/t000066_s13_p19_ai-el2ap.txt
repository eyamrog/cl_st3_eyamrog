The collaborative perspective outlined by Magalhães and Fidalgo (2019) emphasizes
the virtual format of the workshop, specifically its implementation as
an online meeting. In such settings, participants are required to
address various constraints, including time management, negotiation of rules to
achieve the activity’s objectives, attentive listening, information sharing, and information
seeking. These demands necessitate the development of interaction strategies that
extend beyond the use of the English language. These dynamics
were observed initially in the breakout room and subsequently in
the general room. The initial activity functioned as an icebreaker,
serving to prepare participants for subsequent tasks involving personal information
sharing. Additionally, this activity facilitated collective meaning-making through the collaborative
efforts of the group.
