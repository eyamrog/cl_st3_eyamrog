There is currently no standardized method for collecting spiders, which
complicates the comparison of results across studies. Nevertheless, the data
obtained in the present research are consistent with findings from
various other locations. Several studies have identified Linyphiidae and Theridiidae
as among the most abundant spider families (Lopes et al.
2008; Silva et al. 2014; Breitenbach et al. 2015). In
the present study, Linyphiidae was collected more frequently in the
FA treatment.
