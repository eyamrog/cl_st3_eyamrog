The conceptualization of biodiversity primarily as a set of resources
is problematic. Klier (2016) and Martínez et al. (2018) argue
that Western policies often frame biodiversity conservation as the preservation
of “the other,” referring to animals, plants, and areas that
are perceived as distinct from the norms of developed societies.
This perspective tends to exclude the communities and cultural practices
associated with biodiversity, as well as the responsible use of
these resources by local populations, thereby commodifying nature. In contrast,
developing countries frequently face the necessity of economic growth, which
often relies on the rational use of their biological diversity,
even as they are expected to protect it. The concept
of the bioeconomy has recently been introduced to describe the
efficient utilization of biological and natural resources, including the use
of waste products, with the aim of reducing reliance on
fossil fuels and promoting the decarbonization of the economy (Hodson,
Henry, and Trigo, 2019).
