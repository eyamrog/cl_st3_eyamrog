The intervention described in this study consists of two main
components: (a) providing OJS-using publications identified as predatory with guidance
on addressing the factors contributing to their classification, with the
aim of enhancing their scholarly publishing standards; and (b) implementing
verification technologies and communication strategies within publishing platforms to enable
readers to more effectively evaluate journal integrity. The primary objective
is to mitigate the confusion and negative impact associated with
predatory publishing in scholarly communication, while simultaneously promoting higher standards
in scholarly publishing. While there is a potential risk that
such support may inadvertently enable unethical actors to more effectively
mislead authors and readers, this risk is weighed against the
potential loss of legitimate research and the benefits of increasing
the technical requirements for deceptive practices in scholarly communication. Readers
are encouraged to consider these potential conflicts of interest and
the associated responsibilities when interpreting the findings presented in this
chapter.
