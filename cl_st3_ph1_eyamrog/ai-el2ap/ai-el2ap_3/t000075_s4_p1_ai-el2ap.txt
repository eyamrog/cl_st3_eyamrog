This article concludes that the orthodox models advocating full capital
account liberalization during the 1980s and 1990s were increasingly challenged
by empirical studies that identified significant shortcomings in these models
and by research highlighting the potential benefits of capital controls.
In light of this accumulating evidence, revised orthodox models have
emerged that incorporate support for the use of capital controls.
These revised models represent ex-post theoretical developments, in contrast to
the earlier ex-ante theoretical frameworks. The period following the global
financial crisis of 2008 was particularly significant in this theoretical
shift, as the adverse effects of volatile international capital flows
on national economies, especially those of emerging markets, underscored the
limitations of previous models and the need for alternative approaches.
