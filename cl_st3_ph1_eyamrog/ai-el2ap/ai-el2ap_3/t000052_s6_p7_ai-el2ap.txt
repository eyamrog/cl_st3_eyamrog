During the examination of these two new species, two small
sclerotized structures not previously reported in the descriptions of Bagrobdella
species were observed. These structures are: (1) a button-shaped element
located between the bar and ventral anchors (Fig. 14), and
(2) a semi-circular structure situated at the apex of the
ventral bar median projection (Fig. 15). To accurately characterize their
detailed morphology and potential function, further analysis using fresh material
or scanning electron microscopy is required. Consequently, these structures were
not included in the formal descriptions of the two new
species.
