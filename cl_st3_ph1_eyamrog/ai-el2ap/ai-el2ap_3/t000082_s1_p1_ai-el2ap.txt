A fundamental aspect of mutualisms is that partner species often
include individuals that exploit the resources and services provided by
the interaction without reciprocating any benefits to the other participant.
Although the influence of these cheaters on the evolutionary dynamics
of mutualisms has been recognized, their broader effects at the
community level, particularly beyond the directly interacting species, remain insufficiently
understood. Given that mutualisms typically form networks involving dozens to
hundreds of species at a single site, indirect effects generated
by cheaters may propagate throughout the community, potentially altering trait
evolution. In this study, we investigate how the presence of
cheating interactions affects coevolution within mutualistic networks. We integrate a
coevolutionary model, empirical data from animal-plant mutualistic networks, and numerical
simulations to demonstrate that a higher frequency of cheating interactions
promotes the formation of groups of species that are phenotypically
similar within groups but distinct from other groups, thereby increasing
trait disparity. These clustered trait patterns subsequently alter interaction patterns
in simulated networks, facilitating the emergence of modules of interacting
species. Our results suggest that cheaters in mutualisms contribute to
the formation of phenotypic clusters, counteracting the selection for convergence
typically imposed by mutualistic interactions and promoting the development of
modular structures within mutualistic networks.
