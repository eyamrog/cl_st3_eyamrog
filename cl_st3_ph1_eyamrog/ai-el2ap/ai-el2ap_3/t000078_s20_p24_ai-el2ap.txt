We initially evaluated various spatial weight matrices for the model
without SBD controls, considering both level-level and log-level functional forms.
Subsequently, we tested distance-based weight matrices by increasing the initial
threshold by 5% and 10% (corresponding to 8.4 km and
8.8 km, respectively). This approach enables the assessment of potential
omitted variable bias when estimating models that do not account
for SBD.
