This methodology suggests that permanent capital controls were more effective
than sporadic capital controls, which were predominantly implemented by middle-income
countries during the sample period (Fern√°ndez et al., 2016). A
key factor contributing to the effectiveness of these controls is
the high correlation between measures applied to capital inflows and
outflows, indicating a robust regulatory and administrative capacity to prevent
or mitigate capital control evasion.
