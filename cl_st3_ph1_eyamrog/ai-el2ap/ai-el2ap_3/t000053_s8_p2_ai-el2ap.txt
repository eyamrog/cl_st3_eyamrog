The genera with the highest number of species were Evandromyia
(18), Psychodopygus (18), Psathyromyia (17), Lutzomyia (10), Nyssomyia (9), Trichophoromyia
(9), Micropygomyia (9), Pintomyia (6), Pressatia (4), Sciopemyia (4), Bichromomyia
(3), Brumptomyia (3), Trichopygomyia (2), Viannamyia (2), and Migonemyia (1).
It is important to note that 12 records were reported
as Trichophoromyia sp., as the data combined the number of
specimens and their distribution for Trichophoromyia auraensis and Trichophoromyia ruifreitasi;
this was due to the inability to distinguish females of
these two species based on morphological characteristics.
