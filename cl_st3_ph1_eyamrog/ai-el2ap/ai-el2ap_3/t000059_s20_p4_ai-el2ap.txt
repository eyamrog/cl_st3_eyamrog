The median Gini coefficient was 0.149, with the 95th percentile
at 0.310 (1). No journal exhibited an exceptionally high Gini
coefficient (see panel B, Figure 1); however, one journal, √Ågora,
which published 91 signed articles, had a coefficient of zero.
In this journal, the average number of authors per article
was two, and no author contributed to more than one
article during the study period. Consistent with the findings of
Scanff et al. (2021), journals with a greater number of
articles tended to have higher average Gini coefficients, although the
range of variation was somewhat reduced (panel B, Figure 1).
