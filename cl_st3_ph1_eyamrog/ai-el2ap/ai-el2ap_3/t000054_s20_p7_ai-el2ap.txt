Research has frequently served as a justification for the appropriation
of biodiversity resources by scientific institutions and private companies, facilitating
their use in contemporary scientific programs and, in some cases,
enabling the establishment of monopolies over these resources (Toro 2007).
Consequently, there have been efforts, with varying degrees of success,
to appropriate the natural resources of Latin American biodiversity for
commercial purposes.
