Identification. The species is characterized morphologically by the absence of
both internal and external folds in the peridium. In the
immature state, the entire basidioma is covered by hairs grouped
into golden-brown strands; these hairs are lost as the organism
matures, resulting in a smooth peridium surface that develops a
dark coloration ranging from light brown to gray (Maubet et
al. 2017).
