The use of ayahuasca has increased in recent decades, leading
to its incorporation into ethno-tourism and the formation of spiritual
movements such as Santo Daime, União do Vegetal, and Barquinha
(Domínguez et al. 2016). The ayahuasca ceremony holds significant cultural
importance and is traditionally regarded as a practice for physical
and spiritual purification, as well as for facilitating a connection
with non-ordinary states of consciousness. From a scientific perspective, the
hallucinogenic effects of ayahuasca are attributed to the presence of
dimethyltryptamine (DMT) in Psychotria viridis; under typical physiological conditions, DMT
is metabolized in the intestine and rendered inactive. However, the
β-carbolines present in Banisteriopsis caapi inhibit this metabolic process, allowing
DMT to reach the central nervous system and exert its
psychoactive effects (Escobar 2015). Additionally, research has indicated that ayahuasca
may possess antidepressant properties (Sanches et al. 2016; Bouso &
Sánchez 2020).
