The development of sub-centers is associated with the benefits of
de-agglomeration, even though central business district (CBD) concentration offers certain
advantages. Firms located in suburban areas may benefit from lower
land costs, improved access to intercity and interstate transportation networks,
the ability to attract workers from a wider geographic area,
and reduced wage expenses due to decreased commuting compensation requirements.
Effective communication between firms in suburban business districts (SBDs) and
the CBD is feasible when SBDs are situated in proximity
to the CBD and when communication technologies are available. While
business diversity in SBDs may be lower than in the
CBD, the potential negative impact of reduced diversity can be
mitigated if transportation costs are low and land is readily
available near the CBD. Additionally, larger SBDs that provide substantial
employment and retail opportunities can decrease household reliance on the
CBD (McMillen, 2001b).
