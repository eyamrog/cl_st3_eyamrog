The Embraesp database includes data on property characteristics such as
floor area, total area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, parking spaces,
elevators, number of apartment units per floor, number of building
floors, and a binary variable indicating whether the property is
an apartment or a house. However, it does not provide
information on condominium amenities such as swimming pools, playgrounds, or
sports courts. To address this limitation, the difference between the
total area and the useful floor area was used as
a proxy for the size of the condominium amenities available
to each apartment.
