If university ownership does contribute to endogeneity in scientific journals,
this effect appears to be mitigated by the inclusion criteria
employed by LILACS. Notably, the present study utilized ORCID identifiers
for some authors, which is likely to increase both concentration
indexes compared to analyses based solely on authors’ names. Additionally,
LILACS assesses endogeneity more directly by measuring the proportion of
reviewers and editors affiliated with the same institution or geographic
region, whereas the present study relied on more indirect indicators.
The persistence of these mitigating effects, even when endogeneity is
measured differently from LILACS’s own methodology, suggests the robustness of
the LILACS criteria. Researchers aiming to evaluate the impact of
university ownership on journal endogeneity may need to focus on
newly established journals that have not yet been indexed by
LILACS.
