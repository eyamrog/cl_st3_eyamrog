There is broad agreement that the pandemic has the potential
to exacerbate pre-existing labor market inequalities, particularly with respect to
unequal access to remote work opportunities. This study examines disparities
in remote work in Brazil using descriptive analyses and Probit
regressions based on PNAD COVID-19 microdata. The results indicate that
individuals with the lowest likelihood of engaging in remote work
were those who were poorer, male, residing in rural areas,
non-white, younger, lacking a college education, self-employed or employed in
the private sector, and working in agriculture. While a significant
portion of these disparities can be attributed to differences in
occupational selection, certain variables—most notably college education and labor income—exhibited
substantial independent effects. Overall, the pandemic intensified existing inequalities in
remote work opportunities, disproportionately benefiting wealthier, more educated, and more
formally employed workers, while compelling others to choose between maintaining
employment and income or facing increased risk of contagion.
