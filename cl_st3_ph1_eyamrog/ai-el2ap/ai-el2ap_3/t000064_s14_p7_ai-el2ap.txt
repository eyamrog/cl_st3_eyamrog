Chlorophyll content was estimated using an Opti-Sciences CCM-200Â® chlorophyll meter
on two leaves per plant from five plants in each
experimental treatment. According to the manufacturer, this device does not
directly measure chlorophyll content; instead, it assesses leaf light transmittance
and expresses the results as a chlorophyll content index (CCI).
Therefore, the CCI values are used for comparative analysis among
treatments.
