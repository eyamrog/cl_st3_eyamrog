Excerpt 4 illustrates several issues that participants wished were different
in reality, as discussed during the workshop. Some of these
issues did not directly pertain to the participants' immediate circumstances;
however, the discussion appeared to elicit a collective sense of
global solidarity and shared responsibility, as evidenced by participants' reactions
during the session. Given that the pandemic was a worldwide
event, even those who had not personally experienced certain situations
were likely to have witnessed similar cases or to have
been aware of them through other means.
