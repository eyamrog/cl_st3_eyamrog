In a study by Neto et al. (2020), the Shannon
index was higher during the rainy season, with a value
of 2.23 for samples collected between November and April 2017,
whereas during the dry season, from May to October 2017,
the index decreased to 1.57, which is considerably lower than
the value observed in the present study. Conversely, Pi√±a-Rodrigues and
Aoki (2014), in their investigation of seed deposition in fragments
of semideciduous forest, reported that the highest seed deposition occurred
at the end of the dry season and the beginning
of the wet season, starting in September. This finding is
consistent with other studies, such as Braga et al. (2016),
which also indicate that seed deposition peaks at the transition
from the dry to the wet season. Consequently, sample collection
was conducted in September to capture greater species diversity. These
results support the conclusion that variation in climatic factors is
one of the primary determinants of species density and composition
(Dalling 2002).
