The plants cultivated in the greenhouse were subjected to a
maximum light intensity of approximately 412 µmol m⁻² s⁻¹, which
is slightly less than half of the light saturation point
observed in wild (control) plants (Table 1). The maximum rate
of carbon assimilation in these greenhouse plants was lower than
that of both wild and garden-grown plants; however, the overall
shape of the light response curve was consistent with expected
patterns. For the greenhouse plants, the light saturation point was
approximately 200 µmol m⁻² s⁻¹, and the rate of carbon
assimilation remained stable under higher light intensities, indicating the absence
of photoinhibition (Figure 2).
