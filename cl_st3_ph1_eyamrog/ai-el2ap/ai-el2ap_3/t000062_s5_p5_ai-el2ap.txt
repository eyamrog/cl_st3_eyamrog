Corinnidae are generally larger than Linyphiidae and exhibit a glossy
black coloration, which may increase their visibility to predators. It
is possible that these spiders avoid FA in order to
seek refuge in environments with higher leaf density, which offer
increased protection from predation, as suggested by Dinniz (2011). Additionally,
the preference of this family for moist environments (Patucci 2018)
may influence their distribution, as H. coronarium is capable of
accumulating small amounts of water in certain parts of the
plant.
