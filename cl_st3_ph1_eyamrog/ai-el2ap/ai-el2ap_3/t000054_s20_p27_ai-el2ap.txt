Brazil provides a representative example of the requirements for developing
a bioeconomy. The country possesses approximately 15% of the world's
species, extensive land resources, a favorable climate, low population density,
and substantial natural resources. Despite these advantages, Brazil also illustrates
how a focus on raw material exports has hindered the
development of infrastructure, policies, and institutions necessary to support a
bioeconomic framework.
