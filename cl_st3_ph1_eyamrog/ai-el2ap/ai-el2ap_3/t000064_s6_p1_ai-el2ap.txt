Vellozia species cultivated in open fields exhibit a highly effective
photodissipative system, which plays a critical role in protecting leaves
from the combined stresses of the Cerrado environment, specifically the
dry season and elevated solar irradiance. Tocotrienols, potent antioxidant components
of the vitamin E complex typically found in seeds, have
also been detected in the leaves of V. gigantea (Morales
et al. 2014, 2015). Consequently, while these plants dissipate excess
light to prevent photodamage, they also require high light intensities
to achieve full development of their photosynthetic apparatus and leaf
structure.
