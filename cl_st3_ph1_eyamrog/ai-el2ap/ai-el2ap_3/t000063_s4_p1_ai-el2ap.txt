Most Mexican adolescents in our study reported a positive perception
of science. By mid-2021, their experiences during the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic had significantly enhanced their views of science, scientists, and
health care professionals. These experiences also increased their interest in
pursuing careers in science and health care, and motivated some
participants to consider such career paths.
