In addition to maintaining essential efforts to challenge unfounded normalization,
it is necessary for the educational field to reinforce and
support formative approaches that promote the development of researchers' moral
autonomy as an alternative to insufficient normative responses. This article
seeks to contribute to the discourse on ethics in research
by presenting arguments in favor of a formative approach. Specifically,
it revisits the concept of mimesis and examines its relevance
within the context of undergraduate scientific research (USR) as a
potential framework for fostering the moral development of researchers.
