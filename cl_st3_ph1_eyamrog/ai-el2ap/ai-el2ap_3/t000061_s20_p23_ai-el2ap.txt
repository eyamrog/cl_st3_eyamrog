This finding is particularly significant given that only 23.1% of
respondents reported having attended an ethics course during their undergraduate
studies. Conversely, and potentially as a consequence of this gap
in formal training, only 23.1% indicated that they did not
seek alternative methods to further their understanding of ethics.
