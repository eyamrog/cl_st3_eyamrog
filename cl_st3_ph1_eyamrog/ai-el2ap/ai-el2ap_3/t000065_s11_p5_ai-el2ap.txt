Several learner corpus studies employ Contrastive Interlanguage Analysis (CIA), defined
as the comparison between learner language and the target language
(Granger, 2015, p. 13). Learner language is often referred to
as ‘Interlanguage Varieties’ (ILV), a term that emphasizes the considerable
variability inherent in interlanguage (Granger, 2015, p. 18). CIA can
involve comparisons between learners’ oral or written texts and those
produced by native speakers (ILV vs. NS), as demonstrated by
De Cock et al. (1998) in their analysis of word
combinations in an English learner corpus composed of French L1
speakers and an English native speaker corpus. Alternatively, CIA may
compare interlanguage varieties with both learners’ first language and native
speaker data (ILV vs. L1 vs. NS), as in Altenberg
and Tapper’s (1998) study of adverbial connectors using the Sw-ICLE,
a Swedish L1 corpus, and LOCNESS. Additionally, CIA can be
used to compare two or more interlanguage varieties (ILV vs.
ILV), as illustrated by Bohórquez (2015) in her analysis of
lexical bundles in the Ch-ICLE and Dt-ICLE corpora.
