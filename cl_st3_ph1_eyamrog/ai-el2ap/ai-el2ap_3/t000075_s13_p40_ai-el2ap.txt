The results discussed above primarily pertain to sporadic capital flow
management measures (CFMs); however, additional studies comparing permanent and sporadic
capital controls offer insights into their relative effectiveness. Evidence indicates
that permanent capital controls are more effective than sporadic controls
in promoting economic growth and mitigating financial risks. Furthermore, permanent
controls are associated with a stronger co-movement among various asset
and debt categories subject to regulation, suggesting greater efficacy in
preventing evasion. These conclusions are principally supported by the findings
of Klein (2012) and Fern√°ndez et al. (2016).
