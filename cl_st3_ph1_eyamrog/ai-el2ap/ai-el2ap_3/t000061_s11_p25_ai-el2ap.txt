This article aims to emphasize the significance of University Social
Responsibility (USR) in facilitating mimetic learning within the domain of
moral education, a principle that is equally applicable across all
scientific disciplines, including the biological, social sciences and humanities (SSH),
and mathematical sciences. While certain practical skills, such as the
proper way to hold a pair of scissors, may be
difficult to convey through abstract theoretical explanations, the challenge is
even greater when addressing the metaphysical concepts underlying moral reasoning
and their application in research contexts. USR provides an opportunity
for students to observe the practical implementation of moral concepts
by experienced researchers, such as the demonstration of ethical conduct
in the research process.
