In this study, the terms “positive” and “negative” are not
intended to convey value judgments such as “good” or “bad,”
but rather to denote two opposing orientations. Specifically, positive politeness
refers to strategies that address the interlocutor’s desire for inclusion
and group membership, while negative politeness pertains to the interlocutor’s
need for respect, distance, and deference. Scollon and Scollon (1983)
refer to positive politeness as “solidarity politeness” and negative politeness
as “deference politeness.” According to Bazergan (2017, p. 40), solidarity
politeness is based on the assumption of minimal social distance
(-D) and minimal power difference (-P) between participants. In contrast,
deference politeness is characterized by participants who are equals or
near equals but maintain a degree of social distance (Scollon
& Scollon, 1995, p. 44). Thus, deference politeness emphasizes interpersonal
distance, whereas solidarity politeness highlights shared commonalities in participants’ relationships.
