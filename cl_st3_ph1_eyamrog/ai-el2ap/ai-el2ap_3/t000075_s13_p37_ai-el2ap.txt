Ostry et al. (2012) argue that in the context of
currency wars—defined by successive impositions of capital controls by emerging
economies affected by spillover effects—the unilateral implementation of capital controls
is no longer Pareto efficient in addressing the externalities associated
with excessive external indebtedness, as previously suggested by Korinek (2011).
Consequently, coordination of capital controls among capital recipient countries may
mitigate the adverse effects of currency wars. In addition to
reducing the convex costs linked to unilateral regulatory measures, Korinek
(2012) advocates for a coordinated approach that accounts for the
influence each economy exerts on international interest rates. According to
his model, this influence is determined by both capital flows
and the current account balance of each country, implying that
capital outflows from advanced economies should be subject to more
stringent controls. However, Ostry et al. (2012) note that, unlike
emerging economies, capital source economies lack a direct incentive to
impose stricter regulations on their capital outflows, as the utility
functions of their private agents are not affected by the
costs associated with such controls. One potential argument to encourage
capital source economies to enhance regulation of their capital outflows
is that such coordination could help prevent future financial crises
in emerging economies, which would ultimately result in losses for
financial institutions based in developed countries (Ostry et al., 2012).
