Nonetheless, our attempt to contact publishers and journals yielded limited
results. The findings contribute to the existing literature on the
overreach of predatory journal lists. Specifically, we observed a response
rate of 28.0 percent among publishers and 3.9 percent among
standalone journals, with only two publishers implementing our recommendations. These
outcomes indicate that, although outreach may be a principled approach,
it is not an effective strategy for addressing this issue.
This underscores the need for more reliable methods to identify
fraudulent journals.
