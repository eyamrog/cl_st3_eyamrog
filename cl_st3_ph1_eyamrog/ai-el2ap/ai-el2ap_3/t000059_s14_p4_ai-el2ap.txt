Both indices were summarized using the median, interquartile range, total
range, and 95th percentile. The association between the indices and
journal size was visualized using scatter plots generated with ggplot2,
version 3.3.5 (Wickham 2016). To examine the influence of journal
subject and country, the scatter plots were overlaid with separate
smoothing splines for each subject or country represented by at
least 20 journals.
