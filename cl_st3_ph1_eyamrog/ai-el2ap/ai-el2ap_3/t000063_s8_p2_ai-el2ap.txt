Mainstream media, policymakers, and the general public have demonstrated increased
interest in understanding and engaging with science to inform decision-making
and reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Since the onset
of the pandemic, there has been widespread recognition and appreciation
for the efforts of healthcare professionals and the scientific community
in addressing the health crisis (6). Major events such as
pandemics can significantly influence the attitudes of young adults (7).
Historical precedents, such as the 1969 Moon landing, have shown
that transformative events can motivate younger generations to pursue scientific
careers (4). Similarly, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic,
multiple countries and organizations have reported increased public confidence in
science and a rise in applications to scientific and medical
programs, a phenomenon referred to as the “Fauci effect” (8,
9, 10, 11, 12).
