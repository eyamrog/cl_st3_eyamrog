Any selection of texts constitutes a sample; however, the representativeness
of a sample primarily depends on the degree to which
it is drawn from the full range of text types
present in the target population. Assessing this representativeness requires a
comprehensive and explicit definition of the population that the sample
is intended to represent, as well as a clear description
of the sampling techniques employed to select texts from that
population (Biber, 1993, p. 243).
