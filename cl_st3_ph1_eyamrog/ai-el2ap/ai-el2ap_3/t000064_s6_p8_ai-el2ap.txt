In studies of crop species, in vitro cultivation of strawberry
(Grout & Millan 1985) and grape (Amancio et al. 1999)
seedlings under a photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) of 90 µmol
m⁻² s⁻¹ resulted in the development of leaves with photosynthetic
capacity and a light saturation point of approximately 450 µmol
m⁻² s⁻¹. In contrast, V. squamata grown under a maximal
PAR of 412 µmol m⁻² s⁻¹ continued to exhibit characteristics
associated with shade adaptation. For the Cerrado species Pouteria gardneriana,
Leite et al. (2017) reported distinct differences in leaf structural
development when plants were grown under PAR levels ranging from
75 to 150 µmol m⁻² s⁻¹; however, their study did
not include data from wild plants as a control.
