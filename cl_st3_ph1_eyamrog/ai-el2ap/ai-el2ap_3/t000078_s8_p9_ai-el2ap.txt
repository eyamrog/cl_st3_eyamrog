The theoretical literature on polycentric cities can be divided into
two main strands. The first strand addresses the emergence of
central business districts (CBD) and sub-business districts (SBD) as endogenous
outcomes of the urban optimization process, taking into account agglomeration
economies and transport costs (Ogawa and Fujita 1980; Fujita and
Ogawa 1982; Anas and Kim 1990; Helsley and Sullivan 1991;
Henderson and Slade 1993; Sasaki and Mun 1996; Berliant and
Konishi 2000). The primary focus of this literature is to
evaluate how changes in the spatial structure of cities influence
labor and housing markets. Factors contributing to a dispersed distribution
of workers include high transport costs, the absence of agglomeration
economies, direct sales to households, firmsâ€™ demand for land, and
greater price elasticity of labor demand. The second strand of
models examines the effects of employment suburbanization on residential property
prices and related variables (Romanos 1979; Yinger 1992; Wrede 2015).
These models analyze how workers choose residential and employment locations
and how these choices affect land prices, population density, and
commuting patterns. The findings indicate that land prices and wages
decline with increasing distance from the CBD and SBD, suggesting
that the SBD also functions as a determinant of real
estate prices and wages.
