We analyzed 24 empirical mutualistic networks obtained from the Web
of Life (http://www.web-of-life.es/) and the Interaction Web Database (http://ecologia.ib.usp.br/iwdb/index.html). These
networks comprise eight plant-pollinator networks, eight plant-frugivore networks, and eight
ant-myrmecophyte networks. Each network is represented by an adjacency matrix
(A), where each species corresponds to a single row and
column, and each matrix element indicates the presence or absence
of an interaction between the respective animal and plant species.
Ant-myrmecophyte networks generally exhibit lower connectance, higher modularity, and lower
nestedness compared to seed dispersal and pollination networks, whereas seed
dispersal networks tend to be more nested and display higher
connectance than both pollination and ant-myrmecophyte networks (Supporting Information, Guimar√£es
2020).
