When analyzing the results using the level-level functional form (Table
6, columns 20-22), it is observed that the same areas
identified as SBD are consistent with those identified in the
econometric model estimated with the log-level functional form. The only
exception is that the Pinheiros area is not statistically significant
in the level-level specification, whereas the Morumbi area is significant.
