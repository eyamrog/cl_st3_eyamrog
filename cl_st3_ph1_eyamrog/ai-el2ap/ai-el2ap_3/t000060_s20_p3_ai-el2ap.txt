The first part of the “question/answer” adjacency pair is introduced
by the discourse marker so. In this study, discourse markers
are defined as syntactically independent elements, separate from verbs, which
may consist of one or more lexical items or expressions.
These markers facilitate the management of conversation and the organization
of spoken discourse. Furthermore, they are multifunctional, serving as textual
organizers or articulators, indicators of illocutionary force, verbal planners, and
mitigators, among other roles. Schiffrin (2001, p. 57) describes discourse
markers as a set of linguistic expressions that include members
of various word classes, such as conjunctions (e.g., and, but,
or), interjections (e.g., oh), adverbs (e.g., now, then), and lexicalized
phrases (e.g., y’know, I mean). Semantically, discourse markers demonstrate “semantic
aptness,” meaning their appropriateness for the discourse function they fulfill;
their semantic development also supports the principle of unidirectionality, with
referential (propositional) meaning serving as the source for pragmatic (textual
and interpersonal) meanings (Brinton, 2001, p. 149). In the example
provided, the discourse marker so functions as a topic developer,
occurring at the beginning of the turn and introducing a
direct question that prompts the interlocutor to confirm the speaker’s
inference.
