Understanding the distribution of these impacts across the labor market
is crucial for informing policy decisions. This analysis is particularly
relevant given the high levels of informality, prevalence of low-wage
employment, and the precarious living conditions experienced by a significant
portion of the population prior to the pandemic. In the
first quarter of 2020, 19% of employed individuals in Brazil
were wage workers without formal contracts, and 21% were employers
or self-employed individuals not registered with the National Registry of
Legal Entities (CNPJ) (Continuous National Household Sample Survey - IBGE/PNADC,
2020). Additionally, in 2018, 25.3% of the population had incomes
below US$5.50 PPP per day, the threshold suggested by the
World Bank for classifying individuals as living in poverty in
upper-middle-income countries (IBGE, 2019).
