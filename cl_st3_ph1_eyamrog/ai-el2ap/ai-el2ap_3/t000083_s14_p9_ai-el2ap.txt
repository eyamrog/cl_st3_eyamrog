Face validity of the SBS was assessed using data from
a pilot administration of the scale involving 45 adolescents. This
pilot application was conducted to evaluate the extent to which
the questionnaire items were understandable, clear, and linguistically simple, in
accordance with established criteria for face validity (Campos et al.,
2019).
