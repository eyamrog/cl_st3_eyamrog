The majority of new citations have been contributed by contemporary
mycologists since the last publication by Spegazzini, which occurred 122
years ago. The subsequent documentation of gasteroid fungi in the
country was reported in 2013 (Campi et al. 2013), followed
by additional studies conducted by Campi and collaborators (Campi et
al. 2015; Campi & Maubet 2015a, 2015b; Campi et al.
2017; Maubet et al. 2018).
