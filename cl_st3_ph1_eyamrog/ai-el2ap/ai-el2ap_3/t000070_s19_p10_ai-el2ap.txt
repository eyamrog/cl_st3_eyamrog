Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of embryo cells from non-cryopreserved
seeds (-LN) revealed the presence of intact membranes, organelles, and
nuclei in their natural state (Figure 2a). Detailed observations also
identified numerous reserve structures, including lipid bodies (Figure 2b) and
protein bodies (Figure 2c). Similarly, embryonic cells from cryopreserved seeds
(+LN) exhibited preserved cellular integrity, with no evidence of damage,
lysis, or injury to membranes and cell walls (Figure 2d).
Further examination confirmed the integrity of nuclear membranes and cell
walls (Figure 2e), as well as the presence of protein
and lipid reserve structures (Figure 2f). These TEM findings, in
conjunction with light microscopy results, demonstrate that seed structural integrity
is maintained following cryopreservation.
