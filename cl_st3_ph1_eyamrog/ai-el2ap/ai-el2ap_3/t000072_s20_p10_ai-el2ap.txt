The highest number of pioneer individuals was recorded in plots
R, indicating that the largest seed bank of this ecological
group was located at the edge of the fragment adjacent
to the Mogi Gua√ßu River. Forest areas near the watercourse
exhibit greater vegetation stratification, which increases light penetration (Wallace et
al. 2018) and facilitates the germination of pioneer species (Pereira
et al. 2010; Correia & Martins 2015), supporting the results
observed in this study. In contrast, plots I, which are
located farthest from the river, contained a higher proportion of
non-pioneer species. This pattern can be attributed to the more
homogeneous canopy structure in these interior areas, which provides increased
shade and humidity (Wallace et al. 2018), creating favorable conditions
for the establishment and development of non-pioneer species.
