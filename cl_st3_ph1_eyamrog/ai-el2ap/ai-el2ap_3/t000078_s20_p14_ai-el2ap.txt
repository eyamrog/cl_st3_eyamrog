The SLX model that controls for SBD demonstrates the most
appropriate theoretical and econometric fit. The coefficients for CBD exhibit
the expected signs as indicated by theoretical considerations. Additionally, the
analysis of SBD employs the log-level functional form, as this
specification yields a higher adjusted RÂ² compared to the level-level
specification.
