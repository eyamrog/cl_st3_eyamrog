Only 7.7% (n=2) of beginners participated in the survey for
less than six months, whereas 65.4% (n=17) remained for more
than one year, and 26.9% (n=7) participated for a period
between six months and one year. In response to an
open-ended question, 96.2% (n=25) provided a positive evaluation of their
experience in USR. Regarding self-reported dedication to USR activities, measured
on a scale from 1 to 6, 61.5% (n=16) selected
"6," 30.8% (n=8) selected "5," and 7.7% (n=2) selected "4."
These results suggest that USR is a pedagogical strategy that
is well received by students, as reflected in their positive
qualitative feedback, which included terms such as "great" (R1, R6,
R7, R11), "determinant" (R3), "very good" (R4, R8, R9), "incredible"
(R5), "rewarding" (R10), "enriching" (R12, R13), "necessary" (R15), "best choice"
(R16), "contributed immensely" (R18), "fantastic and essential" (R22), and "most
impactful experience of my student life" (R25). The following response
is particularly noteworthy:
