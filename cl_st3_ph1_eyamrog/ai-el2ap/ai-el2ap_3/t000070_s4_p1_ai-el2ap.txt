In conclusion, immersing V. reitzii seeds in liquid nitrogen for
24 hours is sufficient to interrupt metabolic activity, indicating their
potential for tolerance and indefinite storage. The application of cryopreservation
through direct immersion in liquid nitrogen proved to be an
effective method for the long-term ex situ conservation of V.
reitzii seeds. However, the success of this conservation process is
strongly influenced by the maturity stage and water content of
the seeds. Additionally, V. reitzii seeds undergo a natural desiccation
process on the mother plant and demonstrate the ability to
tolerate both desiccation and storage, characteristics that are consistent with
their classification as orthodox seeds.
