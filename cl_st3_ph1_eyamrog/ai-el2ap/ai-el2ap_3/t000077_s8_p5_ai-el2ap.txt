The findings of Adams-Prassl et al. (2020), Gallacher and Hossain
(2020), Gaudecker et al. (2020), and Montenovo et al. (2020)
for the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, and
the Netherlands consistently indicate that job losses were more pronounced
in occupations requiring interpersonal contact that cannot be performed remotely.
Furthermore, these studies highlight that, due to the heterogeneous distribution
of worker characteristics across sectors, individuals employed in alternative labor
arrangements and those with lower levels of educational attainment were
disproportionately affected.
