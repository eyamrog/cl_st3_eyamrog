After finding evidence of the effectiveness of capital controls in
reducing the volume of portfolio flows to Brazil over the
sample period, the authors also examine whether these regulatory measures
produced spillover effects on other countries. The regression analysis provides
indications of positive spillovers, such as increased investor positions in
countries within the same region (Latin America), in countries with
financial markets similar to Brazil’s, and in major exporters to
China. Conversely, negative spillovers, reflected in reduced investor positions, were
observed in countries perceived as likely to implement capital controls
themselves (Forbes et al., 2016). These findings are significant for
the debate on the multilateral implications of capital controls, as
they suggest that such regulations may carry the risk of
functioning as a new form of “beggar-thy-neighbor” policy.
