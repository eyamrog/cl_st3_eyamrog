Therefore, a balanced approach that integrates both mimetic stimuli and
the development of theoretical reasoning appears to be the most
effective training method, as an overreliance on discursive transmission through
lectures is identified—even by questionnaire respondents—as insufficient for adequate training.
Furthermore, the relationship established between the researcher and the novice
in Undergraduate Scientific Research (USR) exhibits characteristics that promote a
mimetic dynamic, which can serve as an effective and legitimate
means of moral training in research. This approach is considered
more authentic, as it is grounded in the actual research
practices of the specific field, rather than relying solely on
external standardization.
