Several researchers (e.g., Cashion, 1985; Harris, 2003) have examined the
relationship between politeness and power and have reached similar conclusions.
Participants occupying the most powerful roles frequently employ politeness strategies
to mitigate the face-threatening acts they are required to perform.
However, these individuals may also choose to forgo politeness strategies
when it is necessary to assert their authority explicitly. Harris
(2003, p. 33) argues that negative politeness features are particularly
relevant in institutional contexts, as these strategies are designed to
minimize imposition on the interlocutor. In Cashion’s (1985, p. 13)
study, counsels predominantly utilized negative politeness features, while positive politeness
strategies, which address the interlocutor’s desire for approval, were observed
infrequently. For example, during cross-examination, Rampton employs the negative politeness
strategy “correct me if I’m wrong” to avoid imposing his
knowledge on the witness.
