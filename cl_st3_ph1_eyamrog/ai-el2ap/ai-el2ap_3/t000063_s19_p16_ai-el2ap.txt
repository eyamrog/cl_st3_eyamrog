Analysis of the official ANUIES reports indicates that first-year enrollment
in natural sciences, mathematics, and statistics for the 2020-2021 academic
year was 32,095 students, which is lower than both the
total number of applications received (82,214) and the number of
available places (45,608), resulting in a coverage rate of 70.4%
of the offered places. Similarly, first-year enrollment in health sciences
for the same period was 126,132 students, which is also
lower than the total number of applications (438,284) and the
available places (180,423), corresponding to a coverage rate of 69.9%.
The gap between demand and supply, along with other factors,
contributed to a 6.1% decrease in first-year enrollment for health
sciences compared to the previous year, while enrollment in natural
sciences, mathematics, and statistics increased by 3.9% over the same
period. Both the number of available places and the number
of applications in these fields have shown an upward trend
from 2011 to 2021 (Fig. 5.b).
