Soil penetration resistance was measured ten times along the previously
described linear transects (Figure 2). Four measurements were selected for
analysis: the first measurement, which reflected the inherent weight of
the equipment, and three subsequent measurements, each resulting from the
impact of a standard 2 kg weight dropped onto the
soil. To reduce the influence of soil moisture on penetration
resistance, all measurements were conducted during the dry season in
August, when soil moisture is typically at its lowest (Oliveira
et al., 2005).
