Theoretical models addressing the existence of multiple centers have contributed
to the discussion on dispersed urban employment patterns. However, empirical
methodologies for identifying these centers have not been a primary
focus in the specialized literature. This paper aims to apply
a novel empirical approach to the identification and characterization of
urban employment subcenters, specifically Small Business Districts (SBDs), using the
Municipality of São Paulo as a case study. The methodology
consists of a two-step process: (1) Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis
and (2) the application of a Spatial Hedonic Price Model.
The analysis identified seven regions within São Paulo that can
be classified as SBDs.
