With respect to leaf transpiration rates, both garden-grown and greenhouse-grown
plants exhibited differences compared to wild plants, indicating that plant
developmental stage influences this physiological parameter. In comparison to other
Cerrado species (Palhares et al. 2010), adult wild individuals of
V. squamata demonstrated lower water use efficiency. Conversely, leaves from
younger plants cultivated in the garden and greenhouse displayed reduced
carbon assimilation rates but improved water use efficiency. In vitro
plantlets exhibited higher transpiration rates, a characteristic commonly observed in
such conditions. This is attributable to the underdeveloped structure and
function of the epidermis and stomata, resulting in limited control
over transpiration and contributing to stress during the transition from
in vitro to greenhouse environments (Van Huylenbroeck et al. 1998;
Amancio et al. 1999; Kaur 2015).
