In the present study, cryopreserved seeds did not exhibit structural
or biochemical differences compared to non-cryopreserved seeds, indicating that cryopreservation
did not adversely affect seed integrity. Non-reducing sugars, sucrose, and
certain oligosaccharides are recognized for their role in protecting cellular
membranes against ice crystal formation during freezing, in addition to
supporting the accumulation of lipid bodies and starch grains (Zaritzky
2015). In embryonic cells of corn, protein bodies have been
identified (Wen 2009), whereas in embryonic cells of Livistona chinensis
(Jacq.) R.Br. ex Mart., such accumulations were not observed, likely
due to the recalcitrant nature of these seeds (Wen 2010).
In the current study, seeds of V. reitzii were found
to contain reserve organelles, including lipid bodies, protein bodies, and
orthamyloplasts, which may contribute to their tolerance to desiccation and
low temperatures, thereby supporting their classification as orthodox seeds.
