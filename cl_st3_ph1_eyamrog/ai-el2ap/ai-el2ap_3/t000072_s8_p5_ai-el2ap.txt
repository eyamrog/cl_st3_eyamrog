One of the primary challenges in contemporary conservation biology is
the preservation of remaining forest fragments (Loyola 2014), particularly given
that Brazil contains some of the highest levels of biodiversity
globally (Forzza et al. 2012). Insufficient information regarding the optimal
locations for conservation efforts and the most effective restoration strategies
often impedes progress in biodiversity conservation. Studies focusing on the
seed bank within remnant areas can yield valuable data concerning
the conservation status of these ecosystems and inform restoration initiatives
in adjacent areas, beginning with the identification of the principal
plant species present. Therefore, the objective of this study was
to identify the main species comprising the seed bank of
a section of riparian forest along the Mogi Guaçu River,
which is contiguous with a fragment of semideciduous forest located
within the Guarnição da Aeronáutica de Pirassununga in São Paulo
State, Brazil.
