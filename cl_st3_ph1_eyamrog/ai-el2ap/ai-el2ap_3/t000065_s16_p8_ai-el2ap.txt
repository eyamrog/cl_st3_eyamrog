The corpus data (Table 2) indicate substantial differences in average
word length across registers. It comprises six written registers, each
with a length ranging from 225.39 to 1,564.50 words. The
research article register contains the highest word count among all
registers analyzed. This finding is consistent with established linguistic research,
which attributes such variation to the inherent characteristics of each
register, including physical mode, setting, and production circumstances (Biber &
Finegan, 1994). Certain registers, such as research articles, inherently require
more words due to their structural and communicative demands. Specifically,
research articles typically follow a standardized four-part organization—Introduction, Methods, Results,
and Discussion (IMRD)—as described by Biber and Finegan (1994, p.
131), which contributes to their greater length relative to other
registers in the corpus. In contrast, the shortest texts produced
by CorIFA participants were abstracts. Although abstracts are often considered
components of research articles, their primary communicative function is to
summarize the article by presenting its aims, methodology, results, and
conclusions. Furthermore, journals and conferences frequently impose strict word limits
on abstracts (Swales & Feak, 2009), necessitating conciseness on the
part of the writer.
