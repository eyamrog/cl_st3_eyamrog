Neutral polysaccharides were detected in the endosperm region as components
of the cell wall, indicating the presence of cellulose. Staining
with Lugolâ€™s solution revealed neutral polysaccharide grains, indicating a high
concentration of starch grains distributed within amyloplasts (Figure 1d, see
arrow). Analyses of seeds at 120 days after anthesis (DAA),
both non-cryopreserved (Figure 1c) and cryopreserved (Figure 1f); at 135
DAA, non-cryopreserved (Figure 1d) and cryopreserved (Figure 1g); and at
150 DAA, non-cryopreserved (Figure 1e) and cryopreserved (Figure 1h), all
demonstrated structural integrity following both conservation treatments.
