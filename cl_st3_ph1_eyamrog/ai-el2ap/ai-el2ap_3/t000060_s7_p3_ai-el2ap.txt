Caldas-Coulthard (2014, p. 1) identifies forensic linguistics as a recently
established academic discipline that is particularly active in English-speaking countries.
The significance of this field is further evidenced by the
establishment of the International Association of Forensic Linguists (IAFL) in
Britain in 1993. Within this context, the present study is
situated specifically within the analysis of interaction in legal settings,
as forensic linguistics frequently involves the examination of spoken language
in legal interactions, including those occurring in courthouses, police stations,
and interviews, among other contexts (Caldas-Coulthard, 2014, p. 3).
