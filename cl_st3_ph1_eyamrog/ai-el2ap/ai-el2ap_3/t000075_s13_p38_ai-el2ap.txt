This article examines the primary points of discontinuity that have
marked significant shifts in the mainstream perspective on capital account
liberalization and capital controls in recent years. The application of
rigorous econometric methods in the reviewed studies has enabled the
identification of objectives that capital flow management measures (CFMs) are
more likely to achieve, as well as those that present
greater challenges. The findings, summarized below, offer evidence-based guidance for
policymakers in the formulation of future regulatory measures.
