CIA study results can provide practitioners with valuable insights into
their students’ needs; however, teachers may also opt to compile
their own class-specific corpora, referred to as Do-It-Yourself (DIY) corpora,
or to design data-driven learning (DDL) activities using either established
corpora (e.g., COCA, BNC) or their own DIY corpora. DDL,
as described by Johns (1991, 1994), involves granting students direct
access to corpus data and concordancing software as part of
the language learning process. In this approach, learners are encouraged
to independently investigate linguistic features such as grammatical rules, vocabulary
meanings, collocations, and lexico-grammatical patterns. For example, following the DDL
framework of "identify-classify-generalize" (Johns, 1991, p. 4), participants in Lee’s
(2011) study analyzed concordance lines from a corpus of texts
from J.K. Rowling's "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone," focusing
on verb-preposition collocations. These DDL activities increased students’ awareness of
preposition usage and facilitated their understanding of the functions of
specific phrasal verbs. Overall, DDL contributed to language acquisition and
exam preparation by fostering a learning environment that promoted student
engagement and autonomy (Lee, 2011).
