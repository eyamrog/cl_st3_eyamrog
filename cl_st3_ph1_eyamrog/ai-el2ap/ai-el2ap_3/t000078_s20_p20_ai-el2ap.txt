concentration of workers earning more than five times the minimum
monthly wage, as indicated in Table 8. In contrast, Belém
and Campo Belo are the subcenters with the largest proportions
of workers earning less than twice the minimum wage per
month, at 60% and 54% respectively. The labor market in
Itaim Bibi and Pinheiros primarily requires highly skilled workers, whereas
Belém and Campo Belo are characterized by a predominance of
manufacturing and civil construction activities, which typically employ workers with
lower levels of formal education.
