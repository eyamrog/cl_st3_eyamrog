To the best of our knowledge, prior to this study,
no comprehensive learner corpus of English written texts produced by
Brazilian university students in classroom settings was available to support
the research objectives of our group. Consequently, in 2013, as
detailed in Section 3, we designed the CorIFA9 corpus, an
academic English learner corpus specific to Brazilian university contexts. The
primary motivation for this initiative was to enhance learners’ proficiency
in academic English. Corpus analysis enables the systematic investigation of
language use within a defined population, and the compilation of
such a corpus was considered essential for the development of
targeted instructional materials and new courses. The objective of this
paper is to present the process of compiling this learner
corpus, highlighting its relevance for understanding learners’ needs and informing
pedagogical decisions based on empirical data. The subsequent sections address
the relevant literature underpinning this work, the methodological procedures employed
in compiling the corpus, and studies that have utilized CorIFA.
