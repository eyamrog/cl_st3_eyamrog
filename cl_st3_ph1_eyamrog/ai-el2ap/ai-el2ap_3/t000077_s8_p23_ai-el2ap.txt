In Brazil, the impact of job losses during the early
stages of the COVID-19 pandemic was substantial. Between the first
quarter (January to March) and the second quarter (April to
June) of 2020, the number of employed individuals decreased by
8.9 million, representing a 9.6% reduction and reaching the lowest
level recorded in the historical series (IBGE/PNADC, 2020). In May
2020, among the 84.4 million employed individuals, 15.7 million (18.6%)
were absent from work due to social distancing measures. This
number declined to 11.8 million (14.2%) in June, 6.8 million
(8.3%) in July, and 4.1 million (5.0%) in August, indicating
a gradual return to work as restrictions were eased.
