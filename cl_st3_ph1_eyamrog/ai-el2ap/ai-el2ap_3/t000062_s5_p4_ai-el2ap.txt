Linyphiidae are typically associated with leaf litter, constructing sheet-shaped webs
close to the ground, and are frequently collected using pitfall
traps (Ferro 2008; Ubick et al. 2005). This family was
also reported as the most abundant in previous studies (Ferro
2008; Silva et al. 2014; Breitenbach et al. 2015). According
to Gon√ßalves-Souza (2008), Linyphiidae spiders show a preference for forest
interiors, which is consistent with the data obtained in the
present study. The higher number of individuals collected in DA
during the hot and humid seasons may be related to
the microclimatic conditions provided by the dense foliage of H.
coronarium, which creates a cooler environment; however, further research is
required to test this hypothesis.
