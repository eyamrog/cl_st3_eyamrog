Identification. This species is distinguished by an exoperidium that lacks
plication and is covered with a light-colored tomentum arranged in
small tufts. The endoperidium is either smooth or only slightly
plicate, exhibiting a light, shiny coloration that contrasts with the
exterior layer. Additionally, the peridioles possess a double-layered cortex (Cruz
et al. 2014).
