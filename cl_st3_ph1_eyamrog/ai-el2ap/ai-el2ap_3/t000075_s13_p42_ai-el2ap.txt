Capital controls were relatively more effective in increasing the maturity
of external liabilities and enhancing monetary policy autonomy during the
period leading up to the global financial crisis of 2007â€“2008.
In contrast, capital controls implemented in the post-crisis period, which
was characterized by globally low interest rates, were less effective
and exhibited stronger spillover effects, as indicated by the findings
of Pasricha et al. (2018), Forbes et al. (2016), and
the model developed by Korinek (2012).
