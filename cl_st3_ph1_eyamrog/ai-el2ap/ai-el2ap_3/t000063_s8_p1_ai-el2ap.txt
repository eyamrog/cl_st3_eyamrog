The COVID-19 pandemic prompted individuals to seek information to enhance
their safety and to use terminology that was previously primarily
confined to academic, scientific, and medical contexts. Since the onset
of the pandemic, platforms such as Google have reported increased
search activity for terms related to the detection, symptoms, transmission,
treatment, and prevention of COVID-19 (1). Social media platforms, including
Twitter, identified “coronavirus,” “COVID,” and “pandemic” as trending topics, and
the term “quarantine” was mentioned approximately 1.6 million times in
2020. Experts from scientific and medical fields utilized social media
to disseminate technical information in real time to both peers
and the general public (2,3). Few events in modern history
have brought science and health sciences to such prominence as
the COVID-19 pandemic, which, by December 2021, had resulted in
over 5 million confirmed deaths worldwide (4,5).
