Pioneering economists in the field of New Urban Economics developed
a theoretical model in which employment opportunities are concentrated in
the Central Business District (CBD), resulting in a monocentric city
structure. This central assumption is grounded in the historical tendency
for city centers to develop around a primary transportation node.
Consequently, monocentric models posit that the CBD functions as a
price anchor, with increasing distance from the city center exerting
a negative effect on various price vectors. As distance from
the CBD increases, transportation costs also rise. The model implies
that land prices must decrease with increasing distance from the
CBD to maintain equilibrium between firms and households. In summary,
the model predicts that endogenous variables such as population density,
lot size, land price, and wage exhibit an inverse spatial
gradient, and these variables are modeled as simple functions of
their distance from the CBD.
