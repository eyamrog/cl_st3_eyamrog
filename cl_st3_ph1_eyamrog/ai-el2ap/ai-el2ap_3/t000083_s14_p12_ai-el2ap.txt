In this study, exploratory factor analysis was conducted to assess
the dimensionality of the Brazilian version of the scale, followed
by confirmatory factor analysis using structural equation modeling. Exploratory factor
analysis was selected initially because the study population, consisting of
adolescents, differed in age range from the young adult population
in which the original instrument was validated, necessitating an examination
of whether the scaleâ€™s dimensionality was preserved. The adequacy of
the data for factor analysis was evaluated using the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin
(KMO) test and Bartlett's test of sphericity (Schumacker & Lomax,
1998). Principal components extraction with oblique rotation was employed, and
communalities were examined to determine the proportion of variance in
each item explained by the extracted factors.
