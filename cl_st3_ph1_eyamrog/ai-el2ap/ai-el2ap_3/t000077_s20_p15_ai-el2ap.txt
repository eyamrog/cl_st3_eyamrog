The finding that workers with higher levels of education are
more likely to engage in remote work is well established
in the literature (Bartik et al., 2020; Gallacher & Hossain,
2020; Yasenov, 2020). In the specific context of Brazil, GÃ³es
et al. (2021) reported that over 70% of the remote
workforce had completed at least a college education. Bartik et
al. (2020) demonstrated that the proportion of workers with higher
education within an industry is nearly as effective in predicting
the potential for remote work as the widely used measure
developed by Dingel and Neiman (2020), which has proven to
be a reliable predictor of industry-level remote work capacity. These
findings underscore the strong association between educational attainment and the
ability to perform remote work. Furthermore, Yasenov (2020) for the
United States and Gallacher and Hossain (2020) for Canada both
found that the most significant difference in remote work participation
is observed among individuals who have completed a college education.
