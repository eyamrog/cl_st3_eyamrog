Duranton and Puga (2015) note the absence of a universally
accepted definition of subcenter business districts (SBD). Several studies have
employed the use of contiguous areas as an empirical approach
to address the difficulties associated with quantifying SBD (Guiliano and
Small, 1991; McMillen, 2003; Baumont, Ertur, and Gallo, 2004). In
accordance with theoretical models, areas with estimated coefficients that are
both statistically significant and negative are identified as SBDs. Based
on this criterion and the results of the estimated model,
the city of SÃ£o Paulo contains seven SBDs, each exhibiting
a negative and statistically significant global effect, encompassing both direct
and indirect impacts.
