Queiroz (2019) conducts an in-depth analysis of the CorIFA corpus
to examine the use of noun phrases by novice writers,
focusing on interlanguage development. Noun phrases are recognized as a
prevalent linguistic feature in expert academic texts, particularly in research
articles (Biber et al., 2009; Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014; Gray,
2015; Biber & Gray, 2016). To assess the grammatical complexity
of noun phrases, the study analyzes both general and specific
topic essays from a CorIFA subcorpus, providing a detailed account
of pre- and post-modification patterns, specifically adjective + noun and
noun + prepositional phrase structures. The study reports two main
findings. First, the analysis of upper-intermediate level texts indicates a
higher proportion of complex noun phrases (59.3%) compared to simple
ones (35%). Second, noun phrases occur more frequently in specific
topic essays, which is considered a positive indicator of academic
writing proficiency, as complex noun phrases are typical of academic
registers. Queiroz (2019, p. 112) suggests that Brazilian learners at
the B2 proficiency level, within an academic writing context and
with exposure to specialized English texts in their disciplines, are
able to produce structurally complex and compressed phrasal structures characteristic
of professional academic writing. This finding demonstrates that discipline-specific writing
tasks can facilitate the production of texts that are more
aligned with academic conventions at the university level. Overall, the
research highlights the value of descriptive corpus-based approaches in applied
linguistics, particularly in English for Academic Purposes (EAP), and shows
that the task variable (specific versus general topic) significantly influences
noun phrase usage among Brazilian upper-intermediate university novice writers.
