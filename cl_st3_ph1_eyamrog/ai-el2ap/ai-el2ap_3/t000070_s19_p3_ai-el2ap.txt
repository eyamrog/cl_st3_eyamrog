Regarding the germination speed index (GSI), no significant differences were
observed between cryopreserved (+LN) and non-cryopreserved (-LN) seeds. Seeds subjected
to the conservation methods began to germinate on the seventh
day of cultivation, with the highest germination rate recorded on
the fifteenth day. Seeds collected at 150 days after anthesis
(DAA) exhibited an average GSI of 17.0, which was statistically
higher and significantly different (p<0.05) compared to seeds collected at
120 and 135 DAA (Table 2).
