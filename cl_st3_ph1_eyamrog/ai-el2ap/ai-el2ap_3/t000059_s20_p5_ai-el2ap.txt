The covariance between the Gini coefficient and the proportion of
articles authored by the most prolific contributor was influenced by
the total number of articles published, as shown in panel
C of Figure 1. This pattern is consistent with the
established relationship between each index and the number of articles.
Specifically, journals with a higher total number of articles exhibited
a low proportion of articles by the most prolific author,
regardless of the Gini coefficient, whereas journals with fewer articles
displayed higher proportions when associated with higher Gini coefficients.
