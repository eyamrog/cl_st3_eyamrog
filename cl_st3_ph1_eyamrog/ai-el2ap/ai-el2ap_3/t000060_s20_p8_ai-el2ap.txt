When Martinez says “pardon?”, it does not appear to be
solely a response to a hearing issue, as the preceding
statement was delivered in a clear and loud voice; rather,
it may function as a persuasive strategy intended to prompt
the witness to repeat her previous explanation, potentially eliciting a
statement that could serve as incriminating evidence. In response, the
witness reformulates her utterance, replacing the phrase "having sex" with
"otherwise engaged," which is more polite and likely to be
more acceptable to the audience. This linguistic adjustment enables her
to construct a more positive self-image, particularly in front of
the jury, by presenting herself as civilized and ladylike. Through
this paraphrase, she addresses a potentially negative aspect of her
prior statement and emphasizes the qualities she wishes to project,
namely, being recognized as a respectful individual. This strategy aligns
with what Scollon and Scollon (1983) refer to as “deference
politeness,” as she deliberately selects a more polite and respectful
expression than the one previously used.
