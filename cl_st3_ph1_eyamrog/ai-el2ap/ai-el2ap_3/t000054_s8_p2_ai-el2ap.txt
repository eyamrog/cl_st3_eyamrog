Among the various definitions of biodiversity, the definition adopted at
this event is notably comprehensive, describing biodiversity as "the variability
of living organisms from any source, including, inter alia, terrestrial,
marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of
which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between
species, and of ecosystems" (United Nations 1992:3).
