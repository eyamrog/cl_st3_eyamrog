Marx (1980, XVI, p. 378) emphasizes the significance of collective
work by stating that it enables workers to transcend the
limitations of their individuality and to develop capacities inherent to
their species. Social interaction within a specific activity encourages participants
to pursue a shared objective, thereby increasing their ability to
act effectively and to achieve superior outcomes compared to those
attainable by individuals working independently (Spinoza, 2003).
