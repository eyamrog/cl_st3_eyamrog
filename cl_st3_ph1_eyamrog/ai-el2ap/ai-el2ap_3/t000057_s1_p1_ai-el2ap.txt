The plant composition, diversity, and structure of riparian forests in
Central Brazil are well documented; however, there is limited information
regarding the physical properties of soils under these forests. Understanding
these properties is essential for establishing baselines for biodiversity restoration
and for evaluating ecosystem services provided by riparian zones. To
address this knowledge gap, this study evaluated the infiltration capacity
and soil penetration resistance of a plinthic soil under gallery
forest in Planaltina, Distrito Federal, Brazil. Infiltration capacity was measured
using a Mini-Disk infiltrometer, and soil penetration resistance was assessed
with a Stof penetrometer along linear transects. The results indicated
that the plinthic soil exhibited high infiltration capacity and low
penetration resistance. The estimated infiltration rates were within the mid-range
of values reported in other studies of tropical forest soils.
These findings suggest that high biological activity and minimal disturbance
are likely contributing factors to the observed high topsoil permeability
in this environment.
