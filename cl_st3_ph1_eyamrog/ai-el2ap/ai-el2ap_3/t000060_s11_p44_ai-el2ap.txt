Goffman (1974, p. 9) defines "face" as the positive social
value that an individual claims for themselves based on the
line others perceive them to have taken during a specific
interaction. Politeness functions as a social mechanism intended to maintain
harmony in interactions and foster positive relationships among participants. According
to Schneider (1998, p. 51), politeness is typically manifested in
grammatical structures through pragmatic conventions that are recognized by a
particular society as carrying specific illocutionary force, such as the
use of expressions like "please" or "could you."
