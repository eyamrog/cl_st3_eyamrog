Compared to journals indexed in LILACS, those indexed in MEDLINE
exhibited a lower proportion of articles authored by the most
prolific contributor (median 2.9%, 95th percentile 10.6%) and a higher
Gini coefficient (median 0.183, 95th percentile 0.355), as reported by
Scanff et al. (2021). However, after applying reweighting to the
MEDLINE journals, both measures of authorship concentration in MEDLINE closely
approximated those observed in LILACS (Table 1).
