Among the 11 host specimens examined, the individual collected at
the mouth of the Mutambala River exhibited the highest level
of parasitism, harboring a total of 286 monogeneans, comprising 269
Bagrobdella vanhovei and 17 B. vansteenbergei. In contrast, the remaining
ten specimens, which were collected near the Orthodox Church of
Uvira, were parasitized exclusively by B. vanhovei. Of these, four
individuals were uninfected, three harbored a single parasite each, and
the remaining three contained five, six, and 35 parasites, respectively.
Such an aggregated distribution pattern is frequently observed in parasite
populations infecting fish hosts (Dold & Holland 2011) and has
been recently documented in Brachyplatystoma vaillantii Valenciennes, 1840 (Siluriformes, Pimelodidae)
in the Amazon basin (Brito-Junior & Tavares-Dias 2021).
