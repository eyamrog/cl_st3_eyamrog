The adult sand flies maintained in FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB were collected using
a range of methods, including resting collection from both artificial
and natural surfaces with mechanical or manual aspirators (“pooters”), human-landing
capture, unbaited and CO2-baited CDC-like light traps, and Shannon traps.
These collection techniques were employed across various environments, encompassing domestic
and peridomestic settings (such as houses and their surroundings in
urban, suburban, and rural areas) as well as relatively undisturbed
sylvatic and wild habitats (including remote forest areas). The collection
comprises specimens from 20 different countries in the Americas, with
representation from all 27 states of Brazil.
