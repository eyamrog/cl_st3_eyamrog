Workers with a completed college education and those employed in
the public sector exhibited notably higher rates of participation in
remote work, with statistically significant differences compared to individuals with
lower educational attainment and those in other employment sectors. Additionally,
there was a direct, strong, and monotonic relationship between remote
work participation and labor income, as the proportion of workers
engaged in remote work increased markedly from the 60th income
percentile and accelerated further from the 80th percentile onward.
