Our simulations characterize the temporal evolution of the mean trait
Z (Figure 1a). The model parameters and their descriptions are
provided in Table 1. Each simulation was run for a
maximum of 1000 timesteps, a duration sufficient to allow trait
values to approach their asymptotic states. In most cases, equilibrium
was attained before reaching 1000 timesteps. To optimize computational efficiency,
we defined equilibrium as the point at which |Zi(t+1) -
Zi(t)| < 10^-4 for every species i, at which time
the simulation was terminated. A total of 72,000 simulations were
conducted, with 3,000 simulations per empirical network; each simulation tracked
the temporal dynamics of species traits under the influence of
coevolution and environmental selective pressures (Figure 1a). All simulations were
performed using R version 3.5.3 (R Core Team 2018). In
the following sections, we describe how this modeling framework was
applied to address each of our three research questions.
