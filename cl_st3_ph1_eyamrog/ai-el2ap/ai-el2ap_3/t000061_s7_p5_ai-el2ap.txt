In philosophy, the relationship between education and mimesis has been
a subject of analysis since at least Ancient Greece, where
mimesis was understood as a form of representation of nature,
closely associated with artistic expression and central to the theories
of Plato and Aristotle (Schlesener, 2009). For the purposes of
this article, the theoretical framework will primarily draw on the
interpretations of Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin regarding the concept
of mimesis. This selection is justified by the fact that
Adorno’s work revisits and complicates the arguments of the aforementioned
Greek philosophers by integrating insights from French ethnology and Freudian
psychoanalysis, both of which identified a regressive aspect in mimetic
behavior. Furthermore, Adorno’s engagement with Walter Benjamin was instrumental in
transforming his own understanding of mimesis (Gagnebin, 1993). Therefore, both
Adorno and Benjamin are utilized as the primary theoretical references
for this analysis, as their complementary perspectives on mimetic behavior
provide a robust framework for examining the experience of USR.
