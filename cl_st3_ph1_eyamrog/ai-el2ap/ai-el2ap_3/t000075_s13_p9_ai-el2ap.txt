The term ‘Capital Flow Management Measures (CFMs)’ includes both capital
controls and macroprudential policies. This distinction underlies why some studies
compare the effectiveness of CFMs implemented by developed countries with
those used by emerging economies, as discussed in Subsection 4.3.
Specifically, CFMs in developed countries are generally limited to macroprudential
policies, as these countries have not imposed capital controls that
discriminate based on investors’ residency since the liberalization reforms of
the 1970s and 1980s. In contrast, CFMs in emerging economies
encompass both capital controls and macroprudential policies. With these distinctions
clarified, the following section presents the main studies that provide
new recommendations on this topic.
