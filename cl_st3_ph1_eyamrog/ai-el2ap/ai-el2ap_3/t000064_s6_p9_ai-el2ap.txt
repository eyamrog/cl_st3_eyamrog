The data presented indicate that chlorophyll formation occurs even under
low photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) intensities. However, the development of
full photosynthetic capacity appears to depend on the formation of
additional structural and functional components that require higher light intensities.
Leite et al. (2017) reported that in Pouteria gardneriana, chlorophyll
fluorescence did not differ significantly among plantlets grown under varying
PAR intensities, although anatomical development was more pronounced at higher
light levels. In grapevine, leaves developed under very low PAR
intensities (as low as 20 µmol m⁻² s⁻¹) were able
to release oxygen, demonstrating that the photosynthetic apparatus can perform
water photolysis; however, these leaves were unable to achieve net
carbon dioxide assimilation (Amancio et al. 1999).
