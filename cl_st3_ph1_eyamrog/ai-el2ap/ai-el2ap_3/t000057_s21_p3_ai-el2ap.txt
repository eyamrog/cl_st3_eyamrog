Our median infiltration capacity estimate exceeded the rainfall intensities observed
during various storms in the region (Figure 4). Therefore, infiltration-excess
overland flow is unlikely to occur in this forest. However,
penetration resistance measurements indicated a probable decrease in permeability with
soil depth, which is consistent with the presence of a
plinthic horizon. Previous research on plinthic soils has demonstrated the
formation of a perched water table above such layers (Moraes
et al. 2006). Additionally, riparian forests, such as the one
examined in this study, are typically located in areas with
shallow water tables (Ribeiro & Walter 2008). If the water
table, whether perched or not, intersects the soil surface, both
return flow and overland flow may be initiated (Dunne &
Black 1970a, b; Elsenbeer & Vertessy 2000), resulting in saturation
overland flow. In such cases, these zones may function as
sources of surface runoff rather than as sinks, contrary to
common expectations. Further research is required to better understand the
percolation capacities of these soils and their implications for runoff
processes.
