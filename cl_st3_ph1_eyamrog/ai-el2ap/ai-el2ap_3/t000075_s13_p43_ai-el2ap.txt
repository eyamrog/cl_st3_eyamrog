Chart 1 presents a classification of the effectiveness of capital
flow management measures (CFMs) based on the selection of papers
analyzed in this study. For the purposes of this analysis,
CFMs are considered to have the following objectives: (1) to
extend the maturity of external liabilities, (2) to enhance monetary
policy autonomy, (3) to reduce the gross volume of capital
flows, (4) to reduce the net volume of capital flows,
(5) to mitigate upward pressure on the nominal exchange rate,
and (6) to counteract credit booms. In this classification, studies
are categorized as demonstrating Null/Low effectiveness if they find that
only one or none of these objectives were achieved, whereas
studies are classified as demonstrating Medium/High effectiveness if they find
that at least two of these objectives were met.
