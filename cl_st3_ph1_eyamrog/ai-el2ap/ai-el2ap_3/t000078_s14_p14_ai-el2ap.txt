In the second stage, data from the formal real estate
market are utilized. The dataset was obtained from the Brazilian
Company for Heritage Studies (Embraesp) and includes information on 4,758
newly constructed vertical and horizontal housing developments in the municipality
of SÃ£o Paulo (MSP) between January 2006 and March 2013.
This dataset comprises 271,861 individual apartments and houses. According to
the 2010 Census, the total number of domiciles (both formal
and informal) in the MSP is 3,573,509 units. Although the
sample represents approximately 6% of the total domiciles in the
MSP, the launch price of each property is considered to
reflect the average market price behavior within each neighborhood, which
consists of numerous existing apartments and houses. Additionally, the Embraesp
database enables the analysis of spatial heterogeneity in property launch
growth rates and housing typologies, which are influenced by variations
in land use policy, consumer preferences, and the financial strategies
of construction companies. This database has been widely used in
previous applied research (Biderman, 2001; Maciel, 2010; Nadalin, 2010; Campos,
2017; Campos and Almeida, 2018).
