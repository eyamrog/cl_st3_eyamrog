When asked to select the primary reason, from four options,
to explain their change in opinion, 28% of respondents whose
perception of health care workers had improved chose “they are
intelligent people that studied a lot” as the main reason,
while 26% selected “they avoid suffering and save lives” as
their second choice. Among those whose opinion of health care
workers had worsened, 35% identified “other” as their main reason,
and 24% selected “they are arrogant” as their second choice.
