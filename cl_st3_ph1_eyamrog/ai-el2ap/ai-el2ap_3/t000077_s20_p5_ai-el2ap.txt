At the opposite end of the spectrum, the following occupational
categories exhibited minimal potential for remote work: domestic workers, daily
cleaners, household cooks, agricultural assistants, farmers, animal breeders, delivery bikers,
truck drivers, janitors, bricklayers, painters, electricians, joiners, machine operators, production
assistants, bakers, butchers, confectioners, vehicle mechanics, and drivers, among others.
In these cases, the nature of the tasks performed is
inherently incompatible with remote work.
