The dataset comprised 68 individuals characterized by 21 quantitative variables
(Fig. 3). Of these, three individuals were designated as illustrative:
individual #66 corresponds to B. auchenoglanii, #67 to B. fraudulenta,
and #68 to B. anthopenis. The first two principal components
of the PCA account for 71.73% of the total variance
in the dataset. The individuals are grouped into three clusters,
each corresponding to one of the three species analyzed: Bagrobdella
vanhovei, B. vansteenbergei, and Bagrobdella pauchenoglanii (Figs. 12 and 13).
The first principal component distinguishes most individuals of B. vanhovei,
which are located on the right side of the plot
with positive axis coordinates, from individuals of B. vansteenbergei and
B. parauchenoglanii (from Cameroon), which are positioned on the left
side of the plot with strongly negative axis coordinates.
