Reppen (2010, p. 33) notes that building a corpus requires
a considerable time investment due to the complexity and interdependence
of the necessary procedures. These procedures include collecting texts, saving
and storing data, marking up the texts, and adding metadata,
each of which involves numerous decisions for the researcher during
the corpus compilation process. CorIFA was initially developed in 2013
at a Brazilian public university. This section provides an overview
of its compilation history, the challenges encountered, and subsequent modifications.
Throughout its development, the primary objective of the corpus has
remained consistent: to describe the written English interlanguage of Brazilian
university students as produced in a pedagogical context.
