Corinnidae was represented by 84 individuals, with 32 (38.1%) collected
in DA and 20 (23.8%) collected in both IA and
FA. The ANOVA test indicated no significant difference among the
treatments (F = 0.98, P = 0.428). During both the
cold and dry period and the hot and rainy period,
Corinnidae individuals were more frequently collected in DA and IA
(Figure 6b), but the ANOVA test again showed no significant
difference (F = 0.208, P = 0.818), and post-hoc analysis
confirmed a normal distribution of the family across treatments. A
significant difference was observed only in FA during the cold
and dry period (W = 0.7500, P = 2 ×
10⁻¹⁷), but this result was not supported by the Kruskal-Wallis
test or Dunn’s post-hoc test with Bonferroni correction.
