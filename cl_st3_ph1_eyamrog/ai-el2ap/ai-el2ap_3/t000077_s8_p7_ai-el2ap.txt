The impact of the pandemic differs substantially across countries due
to various institutional differences in labor markets (Adams-Prassl et al.,
2020; Brussevich et al., 2020). Brussevich et al. (2020) identify
that cross-country heterogeneity in the feasibility of remote work is
primarily influenced by disparities in access to and utilization of
technology, the sectoral composition of economies, and labor market selection
processes, with a strong correlation observed between a country's level
of economic development and its capacity for remote work. In
this context, the present study seeks to examine the issue
of inequalities in remote work with a specific focus on
Brazil.
