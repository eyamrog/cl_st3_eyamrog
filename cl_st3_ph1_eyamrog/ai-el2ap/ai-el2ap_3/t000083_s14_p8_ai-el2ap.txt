As previously noted, the exploratory factor analysis conducted in the
original study identified six distinct factors among the 20 items.
Specifically, four items were associated with the "environmental enhancement" and
"social competition" factors, while each of the remaining four factors—attention-seeking,
mood modification, subjective conformity, and self-confidence—comprised three items each. The
original instrument demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency for each of the
six factors, with an overall internal consistency coefficient of 0.876
(Balakrishnan and Griffiths, 2017).
