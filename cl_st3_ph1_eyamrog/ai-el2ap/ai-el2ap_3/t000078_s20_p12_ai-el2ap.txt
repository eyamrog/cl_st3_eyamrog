As the specification incorporating the quadratic form of distancing does
not provide substantial explanatory power and generally yields statistically insignificant
coefficients for the associated effects, the models estimated using the
SLX approach are not presented for this specification. The results
obtained from the SLX estimator exhibit overall effect signs consistent
with theoretical expectations and are statistically significant. Furthermore, Moran's I
tests do not reject the null hypothesis of spatial randomness,
as shown in Table 6, columns 17â€“22.
