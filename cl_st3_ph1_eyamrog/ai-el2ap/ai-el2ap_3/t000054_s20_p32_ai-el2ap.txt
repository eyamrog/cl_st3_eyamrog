Acetogenins are natural compounds that demonstrate significantly higher antitumor activity
compared to several commonly used chemotherapeutic agents. These substances are
exclusively found in species of the Annona genus, including custard
apple (Annona cherimola Mill.), soursop (Annona muricata L.), and sugar
apple (Annona squamosa L.). The biological activity of acetogenins has
been confirmed through in vitro studies, animal experiments, and simulations
of the human digestive system (Gutiérrez et al. 2020; León,
Pájaro & Granados 2020; Naik, Dessai & Sellappan 2021; Nayak
& Hedge 2021).
