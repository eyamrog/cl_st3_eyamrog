Therefore, these new ex-post models may represent a shift in
the theoretical mainstream and orthodox perspectives on capital account liberalization
and capital controls. This development reflects an acknowledgment that empirical
evidence has necessitated adjustments to existing theoretical frameworks, rather than
the other way around. From this standpoint, it can be
stated that the new mainstream models constitute a revised phase
in the theoretical approach to the regulation of capital flows.
At present, capital controls are more widely accepted within mainstream
economics and are increasingly regarded as important policy instruments available
to central banks.
