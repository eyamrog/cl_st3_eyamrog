In this context, a notable finding is the substantial reduction
in the public-sector effect when controlling for types of work.
The descriptive analysis indicates that the prevalence of remote work
among public sector employees is significantly higher than among individuals
in other employment categories. However, evidence from Table 3—specifically the
comparison between columns 3 and 4—suggests that this difference is
attributable to a composition effect, namely the types of tasks
that are more common in the public sector. Regarding employment
status, self-employed workers exhibit a lower probability of engaging in
remote work compared to salaried employees without a formal contract,
even after accounting for observable characteristics.
