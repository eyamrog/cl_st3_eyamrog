The study area comprises a fragment of riparian forest in
transition with semideciduous forest, covering approximately 140 hectares (Figure 2).
It is situated at an altitude of 620 meters, north
of FAYS, near the Water Treatment Station and adjacent to
the Mogi Gua√ßu River. The site is located on the
Residual Franca/Batatais highlands, which are composed of intrusive Serra Geral
geological formations. The predominant soil type is Typical Red Dystrophic
Latosol, classified as moderate to prominent, with a clayey to
very clayey texture, very deep profile, and gently undulating relief
(LV11) (Rossi 2017).
