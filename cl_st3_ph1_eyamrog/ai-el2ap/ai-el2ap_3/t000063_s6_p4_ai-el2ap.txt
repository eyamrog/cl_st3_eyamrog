During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021 academic
year), applications to health sciences programs increased by 17%, and
applications to natural sciences, mathematics, and statistics programs increased by
22%, both of which exceeded the 7% increase observed across
other fields of study compared to the previous, pre-pandemic academic
year (2019-2020). Despite the higher number of applications in both
fields, enrollment was constrained by the limited availability of places,
resulting in a 6% decrease in first-year health sciences students
and a 4% increase in first-year students in science-related programs.
This disparity highlights the need to examine the factors influencing
the application and enrollment processes. The data indicate a clear
rise in demand for both fields; however, there was only
a modest increase in science enrollments and a notable decrease
in health sciences enrollments.
