In addition to the introduction, the paper is structured into
five sections. The following section examines the concepts of monocentric
and polycentric cities, with particular emphasis on the process of
employment decentralization. The third section outlines the two-stage econometric identification
strategy, presents the estimated results, and characterizes the SBD. Subsequently,
the robustness tests are discussed. The final section offers concluding
remarks, discusses potential extensions, and addresses the studyâ€™s limitations.
