The context prior to the workshop is characterized as inherently
collaborative, as it involves individuals working together and providing mutual
support. Such an environment requires trust and commitment from all
participants to achieve a shared group objective. These features align
with Spinozaâ€™s (2003, IV, p. 9) philosophical perspective, which posits
that when two individuals of similar nature unite, their combined
capacity is greater than that of each individual alone. Accordingly,
the collaborative approach entails engaging with others to pursue common
goals, thereby facilitating both collective and individual development.
