These results indicate that the timing of fruit collection and
seed extraction in V. reitzii is a significant factor influencing
seed quality. The highest germination percentages and germination speed index
(GSI) were associated with lower seed water content, increased reserve
accumulation, and embryo maturity. Similar patterns have been reported for
Moringa oleifera Lam. seeds (Agustini et al., 2015), and data
from Guimar√£es and Barbosa (2007) also support the association between
increased GSI and fruit maturation in Machaerium brasiliensis Vogel seeds.
Thus, natural desiccation plays a critical role in determining seed
quality and vigor, which should be considered in conservation strategies,
including cryopreservation.
