Lysurus sphaerocephalum (Schltdl.) Hern. Caff., Urcelay, Hosaka & L.S. Dom√≠nguez
is a species of fungus belonging to the family Phallaceae.
This taxon is characterized by its distinct morphological features, including
a globose to subglobose receptacle and a well-developed, spongy stipe.
The species has been documented in various regions, where it
typically inhabits decaying organic matter in soil. Recent studies have
focused on its phylogenetic placement within the genus Lysurus, as
well as its ecological roles in nutrient cycling and decomposition
processes. Further research is required to elucidate its full distribution,
reproductive biology, and potential applications in biotechnology.
