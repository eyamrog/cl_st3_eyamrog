The extent of uncertainty and ambiguity associated with Beallâ€™s List
and Cabells Predatory Reports is also a cause for concern.
However, rather than attributing responsibility solely to Beall and Cabells
International, it may be more constructive to focus on improving
the scholarly publishing technologies that facilitate global knowledge exchange. There
is a need for new systems capable of objectively verifying
and transparently demonstrating the degree to which journals comply with
established scholarly standards, which leads to the third phase of
this study.
