The objective of this study was to identify the characteristics
of workers who engaged in remote work in Brazil and
to assess the extent of inequality in the probability of
remote work across various sociodemographic and occupational groups. To achieve
this, we employed descriptive graphical analysis, Kernel density estimation, and
Probit regression models using microdata from the PNAD COVID-19 survey.
