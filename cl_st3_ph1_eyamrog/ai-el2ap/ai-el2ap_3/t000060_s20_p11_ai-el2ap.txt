Coulthard and Johnson (2007, p. 29) state that in actual
courtroom settings, many of the lawyer’s turns during witness questioning
constitute "face threatening acts" that challenge the witness. Consistent with
this view, the authors argue that the lawyer’s role in
the courtroom, especially during cross-examination, enables the lawyer to exert
pressure on and interfere with the witness in order to
achieve the interactional objectives of the Crown or State, from
whom the lawyer derives authority.
