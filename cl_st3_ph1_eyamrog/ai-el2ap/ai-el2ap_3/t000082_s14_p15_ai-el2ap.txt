In the Random scenario, negative effects are distributed throughout the
network rather than being concentrated in central species. For each
combination of empirical networks (n = 24) and scenarios (Random
and Central), 1,500 simulations were conducted, resulting in a total
of 72,000 simulations. All simulations were run until equilibrium was
reached.
