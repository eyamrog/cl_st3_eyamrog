The year 2020 marked a significant turning point in recent
history, not only due to the global impact of the
coronavirus pandemic but also by highlighting persistent issues related to
social inequality that remain unresolved. This global crisis underscored the
limitations of current achievements in safeguarding humanity from various existential
threats. Addressing challenges such as racism, exploitation, violence, and prejudice
is essential for progress. There is an urgent need to
critically reassess current practices and approaches to coexistence and environmental
stewardship (Krenak, 2020).
