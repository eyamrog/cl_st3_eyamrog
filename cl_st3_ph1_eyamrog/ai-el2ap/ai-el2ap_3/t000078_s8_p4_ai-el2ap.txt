Brazil, the fifth-largest country in the world, has an urban
population concentration of 84%, with 43 million inhabitants residing in
only 17 cities, which together account for 34.7% of the
national GDP (IBGE). In the Municipality of São Paulo, 11.446
million people live within an area of 1,512 km², and
in 2014, the municipality's GDP was US$ 237 billion, representing
approximately 11.7% of Brazil’s total GDP and making São Paulo
the wealthiest municipality in the country (SEADE, 2017). Meyer, Grostein,
and Biderman (2004) analyzed employment distribution across São Paulo’s districts
and observed that, since the 1960s, service sector activities have
shifted from the historic center (Sé district) toward the west
and south. This shift initially concentrated in the Jardim Paulista
district, followed by Cerqueira César and Itaim Bibi, with the
latter attracting numerous firms after the construction of Faria Lima
Avenue in the 1970s, which subsequently became a major thoroughfare.
Between 1970 and 1990, employment continued to expand toward the
Vila Olímpia neighborhood along Luis Carlos Berrini Avenue. More recently,
between 2000 and 2010, firms have increasingly relocated to the
far south and west zones of the city (see Table
1).
