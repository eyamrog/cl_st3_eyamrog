This empirical approach enables the generalization of results, provided that
the corpus is well-designed and accurately represents the target register,
defined as a language variety associated with a specific situational
context and communicative purpose (Biber & Conrad, 2009, p. 6).
Researchers should therefore take into account the situational characteristics of
the register, including the participants, the relationships among participants, the
communication channel, and the production circumstances (Biber & Conrad, 2009).
Once the research questions and the relevant register characteristics have
been clearly established, the next step is to select an
appropriate corpus. At this stage, researchers must determine whether an
existing corpus is suitable for their purposes or if it
is necessary to compile a new corpus.
