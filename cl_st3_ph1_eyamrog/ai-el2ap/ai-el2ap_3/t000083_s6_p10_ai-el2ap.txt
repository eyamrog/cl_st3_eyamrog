It is important to note that there is currently a
limited body of research on selfie behavior, and particularly on
selfie addiction. Furthermore, the majority of existing academic publications, including
both theoretical and empirical studies, have been conducted by researchers
based in India. This trend may be attributed to the
relatively high number of social media users in India and
other Asian countries (Lamba et al., 2016).
