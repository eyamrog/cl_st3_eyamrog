The data indicate the significance of Undergraduate Scientific Research (USR)
as a means of fostering the moral development of researchers.
Nevertheless, USR remains underutilized and undervalued in Brazil, as demonstrated
by the 50% of respondents who referenced a lack of
recognition for student research activities. The most frequently cited evidence
of this devaluation was the scholarship amount, which is R$
400.00 for 20 hours of research per week. It is
important to note that this scholarship value has remained unchanged
since 2012, and that USR programs are currently experiencing a
substantial reduction in the number of available scholarships, reflecting the
broader context of decreased funding for education and science in
Brazil.
