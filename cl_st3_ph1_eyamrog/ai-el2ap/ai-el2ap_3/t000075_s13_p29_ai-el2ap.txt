Within the ongoing debate regarding the multilateral dimensions of capital
controls and prudential policies, as well as the need for
international coordination in this area, the study by Ghosh et
al. (2014) is particularly noteworthy. The authors examine whether capital
controls and other regulatory measures, such as macroprudential policies, are
effective when implemented simultaneously on both capital inflows and outflows
by emerging market recipient countries and advanced source countries. To
assess the effectiveness of these instruments in reducing cross-border banking
flows, the study utilizes a sample comprising 76 capital recipient
countries and 31 capital source countries, conducting separate regressions for
each group. The findings indicate that prudential regulations applied to
capital outflows from source countries, particularly those targeting external loans,
have a significant effect in reducing bank flows during the
sample period. Additionally, regulatory measures imposed on capital inflows by
recipient countries demonstrate some effectiveness in curbing cross-border banking flows.
