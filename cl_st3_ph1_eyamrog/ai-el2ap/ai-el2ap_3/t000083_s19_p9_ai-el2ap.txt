Table 5 presents the means and standard deviations of the
factors associated with different levels of selfitis intensity. The results
indicate that participants with low selfitis intensity reported the highest
mean score for the "environmental enhancement" factor (M = 3.39).
For participants with mild selfitis intensity, the "mood and confidence"
factor had the highest mean (M = 3.21). Among those
with moderate selfitis intensity, the "subjective conformity" factor showed the
highest mean (M = 3.19). In the severe selfitis intensity
group, the "attention seeking" and "social competition" factors had the
highest mean scores (M = 4.02 and M = 3.45,
respectively).
