Despite the fact that some mainstream economists have begun to
support the use of capital controls and macroprudential policies with
objectives similar to those advocated by Keynesian economists, our study
indicates that the underlying theoretical foundations of these approaches remain
distinct. Within the Keynesian and Structuralist tradition, the primary justification
for capital controls is rooted in the structural asymmetry of
the contemporary international monetary and financial system, where the volatility
of capital flows and their adverse effects are largely attributed
to the existence of a ‘currency hierarchy’. In contrast, the
recent theoretical shift within mainstream economics is predominantly grounded in
the concept of externality correction, with research methodologies that emphasize
the behavior of individual agents and their responses to government
interventions.
