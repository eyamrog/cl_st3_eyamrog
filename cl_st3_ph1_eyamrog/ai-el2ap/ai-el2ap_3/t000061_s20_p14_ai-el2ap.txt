In this context, an experienced researcher does not necessarily serve
as a model to be emulated. This perspective aligns with
the argument that mimetic behavior is not purely passive; rather,
the presence of a model may prompt beginners to actively
seek personal validation, which can lead them to diverge from
the model rather than simply imitate it.
