Among the studies examining tele-workability in Brazil, the reports produced
by researchers at the Institute of Applied Economic Research (IPEA)
are particularly noteworthy. Analyzing data collected between May and November
2020, GÃ³es et al. (2021) determined that the remote workforce
primarily consisted of formal-sector employees who had completed higher education,
were between 30 and 39 years old, female, and white.
It is important to note that these findings are influenced
by the proportional representation of each demographic group within the
overall workforce.
