Cryopreservation offers significant advantages in terms of potential storage duration,
particularly when using direct immersion methods, which are the most
cost-effective due to the minimal use of cryoprotectants and reagents.
For the long-term or indefinite storage of plant material, cryopreservation
in liquid nitrogen at -196 Â°C is currently the only
available technique (Engelmann 2011). Furthermore, cryopreservation demonstrates substantial benefits over
traditional conservation methods (Vendrame et al. 2014).
