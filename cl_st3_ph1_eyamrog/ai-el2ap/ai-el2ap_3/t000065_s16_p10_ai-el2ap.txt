Beginning in the first semester of 2016, the number of
collected samples increased substantially compared to the previous year, and
this trend has continued. The lower number of samples in
2015 can be attributed to the compilation process, which relied
on mock tests, as previously noted. Not all students completed
the task, several did not provide consent for their texts
to be included in the corpus, and some submissions did
not meet the minimum word requirement. Consequently, fewer texts were
available for inclusion in the corpus.
