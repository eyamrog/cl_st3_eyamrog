In response to empirical findings on the relative effectiveness of
capital controls, orthodox economic models have sought to provide theoretical
explanations for the varying success rates of different control measures.
Magud et al. (2011) represent a key contribution to the
formalization of this new economics of capital controls. The authors
posit that countries implement capital controls to achieve four primary
objectives: to reduce short-term capital inflows (commonly referred to as
"hot money"), to limit the overall scale of capital inflows
and thereby mitigate associated financial risks, to alleviate upward pressure
on exchange rates, and to enhance the autonomy of domestic
monetary policy. According to their analysis, capital controls can be
effective in decreasing the volume of short-term external debt, thereby
extending the average maturity of external liabilities, and in increasing
monetary policy autonomy, provided that the elasticity of short-term inflows
with respect to total external liabilities exceeds one. Under these
conditions, the imposition of capital controls results in a relative
decline in short-term inflows compared to total external liabilities. Furthermore,
increased monetary policy autonomy is observed, as capital controls introduce
a wedge in the interest rate differential between short-term and
long-term external liabilities (Magud et al., 2011).
