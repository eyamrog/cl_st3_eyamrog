Sections of 5 μm thickness were prepared using a hand-rotating
microtome (Leica RM 2135) equipped with tungsten blades. The sections
were mounted on slides and stained with Toluidine Blue (TBO)
to detect acid polysaccharides and with Lugol’s solution to identify
starch. Microscopic analysis was performed using an optical microscope (Olympus
BX40), and images were captured with an integrated imaging system
(Olympus Q-Color-3C, América Ind.).
