Tests on the residuals using Moran’s I indicate the absence
of spatial autocorrelation (Table 4, columns 1-4). When the SLXb
estimator is applied to address potential spatial dependence (Table 5,
columns 9-11), the estimated coefficients for the overall effect are
statistically significant but theoretically inconsistent, suggesting that land prices are
higher at the urban periphery—an outcome not supported by empirical
observation. Additionally, the null hypothesis of spatial randomness cannot be
rejected in these models. The only exception is observed in
the log-level functional form model that includes a quadratic term
for distance from the CBD, where the estimated global effect
aligns with theoretical expectations (Table 5, column 12). These counterintuitive
findings prompt further investigation into the second hypothesis: whether the
unexpected and statistically non-significant results for the CBD coefficients are
attributable to the omission of controls for sub-central business districts
(SBDs).
