Another important consideration is how the outcomes of this and
other verification systems—such as those for peer review, indexing, and
related components—will be communicated to readers and authors. To address
this, we have initiated the development of a "Publication Facts"
label, modeled after the FDA Nutrition Facts label (see Fig.
3). This label will be subject to public scrutiny in
accordance with open science principles and will be evaluated and
refined with input from diverse audiences, including high school students
and journalists, to ensure its clarity and comprehensibility for both
researchers and the general public. The label, which will be
linked to individual studies, will present metrics regarding compliance with
established standards, accompanied by detailed explanations of each standard and
metric. The purpose of this labeling system is to inform
and educate both the public and professionals about research standards,
while providing readers with a concise tool to assess, or
further investigate, the trustworthiness of research publications.
