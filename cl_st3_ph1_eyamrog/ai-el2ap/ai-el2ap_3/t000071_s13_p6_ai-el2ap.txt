While Beall did not specify the reasons for including individual
publishers or journals on his list, Cabells Predatory Reports (2021)
identifies specific “violations” for each title and ranks them from
“severe” to “minor.” Cabells’ list of over 60 behavioral indicators
for journals is described as evidence of “misconduct,” “fraudulent operations,”
and “probable threats” (Cabells, n.d.). Among the journals using OJS
included in the Cabells list, an average of 4.3 violations
per journal was identified. The most common violation was the
absence of a digital preservation policy, classified as a “moderate”
violation, which was noted in 107 journals, representing 45.1 percent
of the OJS-using journals (see Table 2). For each publisher
with one or more journals listed in Cabells Predatory Reports,
we prepared an email addressed to the publisher and editors,
detailing the identified violations. This approach was adopted because it
is unlikely that these publishers would otherwise have access to
this information. The correspondence also included recommendations for addressing the
identified concerns and instructions for notifying Cabells of any corrections
made. For the most common violation, for instance, we recommended
that publishers enroll their journals in the PKP Preservation Network,
which is available to all OJS journals, and publicly post
this as their preservation policy. As the process of emailing
publishers was only completed at the time of submitting this
chapter for publication, we are not yet able to report
on the effectiveness of this intervention.
