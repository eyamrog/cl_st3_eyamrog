Physiologically mature capsules of V. reitzii were collected from a
natural population located in the municipality of Curitibanos, Santa Catarina
State, Brazil (27º17'02.7"S, 50º32'05.5"W, 900 m altitude). Collections were performed
at three distinct time points, determined by days after anthesis
(DAA) based on the species' maturation curve, spanning the period
from physiological maturation to seed dispersal: (1) at 120 DAA,
corresponding to the attainment of physiological seed maturity and the
onset of internal water content reduction; (2) at 135 DAA,
representing an intermediate stage in the natural dehydration process; and
(3) at 150 DAA, marking the initiation of carpel opening
for seed release and dispersal. All experimental procedures were conducted
in the Laboratory of Developmental Physiology and Plant Genetics (LFDGV),
Center of Agricultural Sciences, Federal University of Santa Catarina (CCA/UFSC),
Florianópolis, Santa Catarina State, Brazil.
