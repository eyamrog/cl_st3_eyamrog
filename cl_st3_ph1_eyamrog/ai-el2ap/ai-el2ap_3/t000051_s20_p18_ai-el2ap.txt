In the third section, Scholz identifies a significant challenge in
preventing the expansion of Putin’s war into other European countries.
He references the NATO alliance at the level of explicit
discourse, citing discussions with allied countries in Eastern Europe and
employing dialogically contractive statements that emphasize an unconditional commitment to
NATO’s collective defense obligations and Germany’s resolve to defend every
part of NATO territory, as indicated by statements such as
“Ohne Wenn und Aber” (‘unconditionally’) and “Wir meinen das sehr
ernst” (‘We are absolutely serious about this’). This stance is
further linked to the discourse of Germany as a military
power, which is implicitly conveyed through a list of recent
actions undertaken by the German army, described as “wichtige” (‘important’)
signals. Additionally, Scholz expresses gratitude to soldiers for their “important”
services and uses the phrase “sicher auch in Ihrem Namen”
(‘surely also in your name’) to contractively align the audience
with his position.
