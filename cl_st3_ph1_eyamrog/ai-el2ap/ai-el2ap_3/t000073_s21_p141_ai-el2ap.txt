Identification. The species is distinguished by a whitish pseudostipe exhibiting
small perforations, and an off-white, perforate, narrowly campanulate receptacle that
is wrinkled to minutely rugulose with a toothed margin. The
apex of the receptacle features a prominent pore, around which
a ring-like structure is clearly observable (Trierveiler-Pereira et al. 2019).
