The mutualism component, Smi, is defined as the sum of
the selective effects exerted by all mutualistic partners of species
i. It is assumed that selection resulting from mutualistic interactions
promotes trait matching among mutualistic partners. Perfect trait matching between
partners i and j is considered to occur when |Zj(t)
- Zi(t)| = 0, as described by Guimar√£es et al.
(2011). Since a given species may interact with multiple mutualistic
partners, and each partner may contribute unequally to the selection
process, the contribution of partner j to selection on species
i is represented by mij(t). The total contribution of all
mutualistic partners to selection on Zi is therefore defined as:
