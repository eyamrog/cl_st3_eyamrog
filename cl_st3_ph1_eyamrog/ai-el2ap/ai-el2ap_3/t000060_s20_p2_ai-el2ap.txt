In the excerpts, the sentences selected for analysis are presented
in italics. The first three excerpts originate from the final
day of Jodi Ann Arias’s cross-examination (Day 25). During these
proceedings, Juan Martinez served as the deputy county attorney, while
Kirk Nurmi and Jennifer Willmott represented the defendant, and Sherry
K. Stephens presided as the judge. The remaining excerpts were
sourced from the official reporter’s transcript of the proceedings.
