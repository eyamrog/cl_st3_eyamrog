As of mid-2021, 91% of 14- to 19-year-old respondents to
the anonymous questionnaire reported a favorable perception of science, with
"knowledge" being the most frequently associated term. Additionally, 70% of
adolescents indicated that their experience during the COVID-19 pandemic improved
their opinion of science, scientists, and health care workers, while
only 8% and 4% reported a worsened perception of science
and of scientists and health care workers, respectively. Notably, a
greater proportion of adolescents reported an improved perception of both
scientists and health care workers as a result of the
pandemic (58%) compared to those who reported a worsened perception
of both groups (1%).
