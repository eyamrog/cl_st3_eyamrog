Three studies utilizing CorIFA have focused on learners’ use of
conjunctions, which are recognized as important elements in achieving text
coherence (Halliday & Hasan, 1976; Chen, 2006; Liu, 2008; Zihan,
2014). However, these linguistic features are not always necessary and
must be used judiciously (Altenberg & Tapper, 1998, p. 80),
presenting challenges for learners since their usage patterns can differ
across languages and cultures (Altenberg & Tapper, 1998, p. 81).
Dutra et al. (2017, 2019) and Santos (2008) analyzed a
CorIFA subcorpus of B1-level argumentative essays and compared it to
LOCNESS. Although each study examined different types of conjunctions—Dutra et
al. (2017) investigated additive conjunctions (besides and also), Dutra et
al. (2019) focused on result markers (thus, so, and therefore),
and Santos (2008) analyzed contrastive connectors (but and however)—all identified
notable quantitative differences (such as underuse or overuse relative to
LOCNESS or MICUSP), variations in sentence position, and inadequacies in
discourse function among learners. For example, the conjunction so appears
three times more frequently in CorIFA than in LOCNESS, often
occupying sentence-initial positions to introduce topics or signal the repetition
of an idea, functions typically associated with oral discourse markers
(Carter & McCarthy, 2006; Dutra et al., 2019). The consistent
finding across these studies is that learners’ frequent use of
conjunctions at the beginning of sentences indicates a need for
greater emphasis on register awareness in the Brazilian university context.
