To address the issue of omitted variable bias, we estimate
spatial econometric models that account for both direct and indirect
effects by including relevant amenity controls. As noted by Can
(1992) and Campos and Almeida (2018), the decomposition of real
estate prices reveals two distinct effects: the impact attributable to
the intrinsic characteristics of the property and the spatial spillover
effect arising from the attributes of neighboring properties. Consequently, our
econometric analysis focuses on the estimation and interpretation of the
global effect, which encompasses both direct and indirect influences on
real estate prices.
