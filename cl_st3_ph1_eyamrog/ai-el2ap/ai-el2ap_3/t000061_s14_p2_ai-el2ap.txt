At this stage, which represents the initial phase of the
researcher's professional development, the potential to approach research training through
the process of supervising the end-of-course paper (TCC) was considered.
However, in most cases, Undergraduate Scientific Research (USR) chronologically precedes
TCC supervision, serving as the researcher's first formal exposure to
research activities. Furthermore, the supervision of TCCs varies across institutions
and is generally less rigorous than USR in terms of
adherence to research methodologies and ethical standards. In USR, the
trainee researcher is integrated into an established research project, typically
as a member of a research group that relies on
external funding and, therefore, must strictly comply with regulatory procedures.
This integration also involves more substantial interactions with the university
and broader society, aspects that are often less emphasized in
the context of TCCs.
