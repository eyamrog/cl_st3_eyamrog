Participants from diverse professional backgrounds convened to engage in activities
that involved discussing their experiences during the crisis and expressing
aspirations for improvement. The workshop activities were designed to encourage
participants, who were university-level English language learners, to use English
from a critical perspective, enabling them to analyze real-life situations
and articulate their viewpoints based on both personal and shared
experiences. In this multimodal context, English functioned as one of
several communicative resources, alongside facial expressions, laughter, gestures, sounds, and
written texts, all of which contributed to facilitating interaction among
participants.
