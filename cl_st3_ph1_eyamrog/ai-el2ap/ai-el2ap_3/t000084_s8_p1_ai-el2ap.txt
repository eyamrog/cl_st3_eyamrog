The Internet has significantly altered communication practices, particularly with the
advent of the Web and digital technologies, which have facilitated
the development of a distinct form of online language characterized
by features of speech, writing, and electronically mediated properties (Crystal,
2004, p. 48). Early forms of this language variation emerged
in asynchronous communication, exemplified by the use of emoticons—such as
:-) to indicate happiness and :-( to indicate sadness—to convey
emotions or moods. Recent technological advancements have led to the
widespread adoption of emojis, which are now commonly used across
social media platforms, SMS, messaging services, and mobile applications such
as WhatsApp to express emotions and convey a range of
meanings.
