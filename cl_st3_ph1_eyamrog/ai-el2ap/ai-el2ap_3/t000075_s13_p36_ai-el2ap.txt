Recent theoretical literature has introduced models that support the international
coordination of capital controls, marking a significant departure from traditional
views that favored complete capital account liberalization, such as those
based on the efficient markets hypothesis. These studies provide a
formal framework for the multilateral aspects of capital controls, proposing
coordination both among capital recipient countries and between capital recipient
and capital source countries. A central argument in this literature
is that the unilateral implementation of capital controls by emerging
market economies entails increasing and convex costs, leading to a
reduction in welfare as measured by the utility functions of
private agents in countries that intensively apply such measures. Consequently,
policies that promote the international coordination of capital controls are
recommended to distribute the associated regulatory burden more evenly among
recipient countries and between recipient and source countries, thereby mitigating
the convex costs linked to unilateral capital inflow controls (Ostry
et al., 2012; Korinek, 2012).
