It is not possible to identify the most widely distributed
species, as comprehensive sampling across all ecoregions of the country
has not been conducted. Dring (1973) and Miller & Miller
(1988) estimated the presence of approximately one hundred genera of
gasteromycetes; however, the diversity of this group remains underrepresented in
Paraguay, with only 15 genera documented in the existing literature.
