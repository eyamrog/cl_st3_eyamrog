Similar to Plato, who criticized mimetic behavior, Frankfurt School authors
also acknowledge the strong human tendency toward imitation. Adorno, in
particular, identifies an "unavoidable moment of mimesis that is intrinsic
to all human knowledge and practice" (Adorno, 2009: 131). Recognizing
the inevitability of this mimetic element, Adorno (2009) contends that
the rational emancipation sought by the Enlightenment should be constructed
through the conscious overcoming of this initial and inherent mimetic
engagement with reality. According to Adorno and Horkheimer (1985), whose
analysis is significantly influenced by Freud (1996), failure to rationally
transcend this primary mimetic stage poses the risk of adopting
regressive behaviors. Among these, the most significant is the manifestation
of a "deeply rooted tendency in the living being, the
overcoming of which signifies evolution: the tendency to lose oneself
rather than actively assert oneself in relation to the environment,
the propensity to relinquish agency and regress to a more
natural state" (Adorno and Horkheimer, 1985: 187).
