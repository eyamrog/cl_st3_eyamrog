Confirmatory factor analysis using structural equation modeling indicated an excellent
model fit, with χ2 = 2.42, Goodness of Fit Index
(GFI) = 0.92 (acceptable ≥ 0.85), Adjusted Goodness of Fit
Index (AGFI) = 0.89 (acceptable ≥ 0.80), Bentler & Bonett's
Non-Normed Fit Index (NNFI) = 0.92 (acceptable values close to
1), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) = 0.96 (acceptable values close to
1), Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 0.93 (acceptable ≥ 0.90),
and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0.041
(90% CI: 0.034–0.062; acceptable ≤ 0.08). All factor loadings were
statistically significant (t > 1.96, p < 0.05). The acceptance
thresholds for these indices were based on the criteria established
by Hair et al. (2009), Hatcher (1994), Hu & Bentler
(1999), and Bowling (2005). Items for the five factors demonstrated
significant loadings, with values equal to or greater than 0.60,
meeting the content validity requirements as outlined by Nunnally (1978),
which stipulate that items should load on a single construct.
The results of the fit indices and content validity were
further supported by significant correlations among items in the factor
analysis, as well as by Pearson correlation and corrected item-total
correlation analyses, confirming the content validity of the scale. The
data matrix demonstrated good adequacy for factor analysis, with observed
communalities ranging from 0.61 to 0.89; the highest communality (0.89)
was observed for item 8 ("Taking selfie in different poses
increases my social status"), indicating that 89% of its variance
was explained by the factors. High communalities (≥ 0.5) suggest
that the principal components method extracted a substantial proportion of
variance from each item (Hair et al., 2009). Among the
factors, "environmental enhancement" accounted for the lowest proportion of explained
variance (20.33%), while "subjective conformity," "mood and confidence," "attention seeking,"
and "social competition" accounted for 78.22%, 67.88%, 52.34%, and 38.94%
of the variance explained for each respective factor (see Table
1).
