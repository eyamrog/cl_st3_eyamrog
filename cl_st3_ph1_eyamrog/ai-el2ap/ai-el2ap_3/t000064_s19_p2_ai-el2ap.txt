Distinct differences in photosynthetic parameters were observed among the treatments.
In the in vitro plants, some leaves exhibited limited carbon
dioxide uptake, primarily at light intensities between 100 and 200
µmol m⁻² s⁻¹; however, the overall measurements predominantly reflected respiration,
with maximal net photosynthetic rates (A) of -0.35 ± 1.25
µmol CO₂ m⁻² s⁻¹. As shown in Figure 3, the
leaves of in vitro plantlets displayed a variable pattern of
respiration up to a light intensity of 100 µmol m⁻²
s⁻¹, above which respiration rates decreased progressively up to 900
µmol m⁻² s⁻¹. At light intensities exceeding this threshold, a
slight increase in respiration rate was observed, which may indicate
photodamage. Consequently, in vitro plants did not exhibit a light
compensation point under the conditions tested.
