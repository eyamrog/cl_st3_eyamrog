The conventional economic policy mix has experienced significant changes in
recent years. In response to the substantial capital inflows observed
in emerging economies following the global financial crisis, De Gregorio
(2014) advocates for an economic framework comprising: (i) a flexible
exchange rate to deter one-sided speculation and arbitrage, (ii) an
inflation targeting regime, and (iii) a sustainable fiscal balance. However,
the author notes that these measures may be insufficient to
address excessive financial flows, thereby necessitating the implementation of capital
controls. According to the author, the adoption of regulatory measures
should complement and reinforce the pursuit of sustainable macroeconomic policies.
