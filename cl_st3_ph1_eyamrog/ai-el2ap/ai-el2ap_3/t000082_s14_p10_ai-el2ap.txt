We evaluated the impact of the emergence of cheating interactions
on the coevolutionary process. In each simulation, we defined a
probability \( p \) that an interaction within a mutualistic
network is a cheating interaction rather than a mutualism. We
explored values of \( p \) ranging from 0.01 to
1 to assess how varying frequencies of cheating interactions influence
the outcome of the coevolutionary process. In this initial analysis,
we assumed that cheating interactions are randomly distributed across all
interactions in the mutualistic network, with the frequency of cheating
interactions fixed for each simulation. This approach generates a network
containing both positive (mutualistic) and negative (cheating) effects, thereby integrating
the effects of mutualism and cheating within a single network
structure (Meli√°n et al. 2009). Cheating interactions were defined as
those with a negative effect on one partner and a
positive effect on the other (i.e., antagonistic), and we prohibited
double-negative (mutually detrimental) interactions between species. To achieve this, we
applied the transformation from positive to negative effect based on
\( p \) only in the lower triangle of the
adjacency matrix, thereby ensuring that cheating interactions consist of one
positive and one negative effect. We also assumed that the
outcome of each interaction remained constant over time. While this
approach does not allow for the examination of conditional or
temporally variable outcomes, it provides a basis for investigating how
cheating interactions affect coevolutionary dynamics. Additionally, we conducted sensitivity analyses
in which we relaxed the assumption of fixed interaction outcomes,
allowing interactions to shift between positive and negative effects during
simulations. These analyses indicated that temporal variability in interaction outcomes
does not affect our main results (see Supporting Information).
