An implication for practice is that both internal and external
journal evaluations should account for journal size when interpreting authorship
concentration indexes. For example, in a journal publishing one thousand
articles, the most prolific author may contribute only 1% of
the total output (ten articles), whereas in a journal publishing
fifty articles, even the least prolific authors would represent at
least 2% of the total. Additionally, larger journals are capable
of serving broader and more diverse scientific communities compared to
smaller journals. It is also important to note that the
Gini coefficient, or any other measure of inequality, tends to
be higher for aggregate populations than for their sub-populations, provided
there is any inequality among the sub-populations (Pyatt 1976).
