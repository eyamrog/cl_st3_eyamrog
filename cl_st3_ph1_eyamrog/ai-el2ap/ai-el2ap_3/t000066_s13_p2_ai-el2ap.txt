The decision to offer the workshop was made in July
2020, following a challenging semester during which students in fields
such as Logistics, Human Resources, Commercial Management, Systems Analysis, and
Business had not fully adapted to significant changes in their
course routines, nor to the uncertainties of the job market.
The primary objective of the workshop was to provide participants
with an opportunity to discuss their concerns about speaking English
online with unfamiliar individuals and to learn about international responses
to the ongoing crisis. It was anticipated that this approach
would enable participants to critically evaluate diverse perspectives, form informed
opinions, and collaborate effectively.
