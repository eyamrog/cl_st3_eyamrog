Xenoctenidae was represented by 30 individuals, with 20 (67%) collected
in the IA, 7 (23%) in the DA, and 3
(10%) in the FA. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated a
marginally significant difference among treatments (F = 4.017, P =
0.0781), and the Tukey HSD test identified a difference only
between IA and FA (P = 0.0781). When considering seasonal
variation, significant differences were observed only during the hot and
humid period in the IA and FA, and during the
cold and dry period in the FA (W = 0.7500,
P = 2 × 10⁻¹⁷). The Levene test, using the
mean, indicated a difference in the homogeneity of variances only
for the hot and humid period (F = 5.0256, P
= 0.05223); however, this difference was not observed when the
median was used (F = 0.4138, P = 0.6787). No
significant differences were detected in the Kruskal-Wallis test or Dunn's
post-hoc test, adjusted by the Bonferroni method, for seasonal data.
