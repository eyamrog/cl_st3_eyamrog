The Parasitology Collection of the Basic Pathology Department, located in
the Biological Science Sector of the Federal University of Paraná
(ColPar/DPAT/BL/UFPR), was established in the 1960s as a result of
various research projects. Professor Ana Leuch Lozovei, along with her
students and collaborators, played a significant role in collecting and
identifying the taxonomic groups represented in the collection. The collection
contains several families of insect vectors, with particular emphasis on
the family Culicidae, which includes specimens collected from multiple municipalities
in the state of Paraná, southern Brazil, between 1967 and
1999.
