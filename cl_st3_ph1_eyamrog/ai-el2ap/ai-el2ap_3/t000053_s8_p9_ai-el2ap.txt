Acre state is recognized as a hotspot for American tegumentary
leishmaniasis in the Amazon region, with cases reported across all
genders and age groups. However, there has been a notable
increase in notifications among women and children, indicating the possibility
of distinct transmission cycles in the area [19, 20]. In
terms of Leishmania species identified in human cases within the
region, all species of the subgenus Viannia, except for L.
lindenbergi Silveira, Ishikawa & de Souza, 2002, as well as
L. amazonensis from the subgenus Leishmania, have been reported to
date [12, 20, 21].
