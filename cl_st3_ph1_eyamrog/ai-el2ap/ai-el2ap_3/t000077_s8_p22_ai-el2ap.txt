Balde et al. (2020) reported that informal workers in sub-Saharan
Africa exhibited a higher likelihood of job loss or reductions
in earnings. Similarly, Estupinan et al. (2021) found that, in
India, workers employed in non-essential industries and those unable to
work from home were the most adversely affected.
