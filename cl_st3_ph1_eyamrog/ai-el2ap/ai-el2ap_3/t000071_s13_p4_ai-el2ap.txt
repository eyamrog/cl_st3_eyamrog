In our analysis of 14 publishers and two standalone journals,
we found that seven publishers (14 percent of those randomly
selected) did not charge authors for publication, thereby excluding them
from the definitions of “predatory” as outlined by Beall and
Cabells. Of these seven publishers, two sold subscriptions to their
journals, while five had neither subscription fees nor author charges.
Additionally, we evaluated all entities against eight key criteria derived
from Beall’s 2015 standards, supplemented by inclusion in the Directory
of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) and Google Scholar (see Table
1). Among the publishers that imposed author charges, only one
(Fundamental Journals) failed to meet seven or more of the
ten scholarly standards assessed.
