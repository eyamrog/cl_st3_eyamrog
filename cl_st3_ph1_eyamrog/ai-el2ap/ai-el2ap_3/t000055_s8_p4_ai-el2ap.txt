The collection was officially established in 1953 as part of
the research activities conducted by Professor Amilcar Vianna Martins and
Alda Lima Falcão, in collaboration with technician João Evangelista da
Silva, who participated in all fieldwork [13]. The number of
specimens in the collection increased substantially during the 1960s and
1970s. Over the past 20 years, the collection has continued
to expand, with the addition of fossil specimens as well
as voucher specimens derived from DNA-based barcoding studies and other
epidemiological research involving fieldwork [7,14].
