The current pandemic has resulted in the most significant economic
disruption since the Great Depression (Campello et al., 2020). As
this represents an unprecedented health and economic crisis, a rapidly
expanding body of literature has emerged to evaluate the effects
of Covid-19. Jonas (2013) identifies potential demand and supply shocks
associated with pandemics, noting that avoidance behaviors and social distancing
measures can cause substantial negative demand shocks and supply chain
disruptions. Additionally, the spread of contagion imposes both direct and
indirect costs, including reduced production due to worker mortality, illness,
and other forms of absenteeism related to the disease. These
factors can interact to produce cascading economic impacts.
