The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test yielded a value of 0.803, indicating
adequate sampling, while Bartlett's test of sphericity produced a value
of 0.89921 with p=0.001, confirming the suitability of the data
for factor analysis (Hair et al., 2009; Kaiser & Rice,
1974; Tabachnick & Fidell, 2001). Table 1 displays the results
of the Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) conducted on the SBS
using a sample of 261 adolescents. In contrast to the
original version, the EFA identified five factors rather than six,
with items from the "mood modification" and "self-confidence" factors loading
onto a single factor, which was designated as "mood and
confidence." The eigenvalues for the five factors ranged from 1.05
to 5.10, which is considered satisfactory (Hair et al., 2009).
Collectively, these five factors accounted for 78.3% of the total
variance. Consistent with the original study (Balakrishnan & Griffiths, 2017),
at least three items loaded onto each factor, supporting the
homogeneity of the measure (Byrne, 2001).
