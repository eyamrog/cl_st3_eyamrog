This article examines the use of formulations, politeness strategies, and
facework by speakers to achieve specific communicative goals in courtroom
interactions. The analysis is grounded in the theoretical frameworks of
conversation analysis and forensic linguistics, utilizing a corpus drawn from
the trial of Jodi Ann Arias, a case that received
significant media coverage in the United States. The data analyzed
consist of excerpts from the final day of the prosecutor’s
cross-examination and a reporter’s transcript of the proceedings, both of
which are publicly accessible online. The study demonstrates that these
linguistic devices play a crucial role in constructing, enhancing, threatening,
or undermining the social image of individuals involved in courtroom
settings.
