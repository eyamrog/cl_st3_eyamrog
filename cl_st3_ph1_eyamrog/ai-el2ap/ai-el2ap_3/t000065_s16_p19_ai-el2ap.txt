The future agenda is promising and should address, among other
issues, advancements in research methodologies, improved access to students' interlanguage,
the implementation of longitudinal studies, and the analysis of variation
across registers and disciplines. Additionally, it is essential to increase
the integration of Data-Driven Learning (DDL) activities (Johns, 1991) in
language classrooms, providing clear information regarding their advantages and limitations,
and thereby facilitating the transfer of research findings into practical
applications, as demonstrated by Almeida et al. (in press).
