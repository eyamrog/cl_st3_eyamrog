Of the participants, 26.9% (n=7) indicated a desire to pursue
a career in research, reflecting what Wulf (2016, p. 555)
describes as a mimetic desire to become a researcher. This
finding suggests that, beyond the scientific content of the research,
the educational relationship—specifically, the interpersonal dynamic between students and mentors—plays
a significant role. For example, one respondent identified the primary
motivation for undertaking the undergraduate scientific research (USR) as the
“possibility of working with Prof. [name withheld]” (R9). Similarly, other
responses highlighted the advisor as the most positive aspect of
the USR experience.
