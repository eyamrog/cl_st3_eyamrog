Meanwhile, these entities consolidated their dominance in the manufacturing of
products derived from these raw materials, resulting in a current
market environment where the likelihood of Latin American industries competing
effectively with established firms in Europe, North America, or Asia
is minimal. The prospect of a Latin American entrepreneur successfully
challenging major corporations such as Ford, Toyota, Monsanto, or BASF,
even within their own national markets, appears highly improbable. Nevertheless,
it remains clear that the region must pursue continued economic
development. The question, therefore, is how this objective can be
achieved.
