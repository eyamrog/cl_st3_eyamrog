The primary motivation for employing a spatial econometric model arises
from a substantial body of empirical literature that identifies spatial
factors as inherent characteristics of the housing market and, by
extension, its spatially structured datasets (Arnold, 1987; 1998b). Furthermore, the
necessity of testing for spatial association is underscored by the
interaction between spatial heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation, as spatial heterogeneity
can induce spatial autocorrelation, and conversely, spatial autocorrelation can give
rise to spatial heterogeneity.
