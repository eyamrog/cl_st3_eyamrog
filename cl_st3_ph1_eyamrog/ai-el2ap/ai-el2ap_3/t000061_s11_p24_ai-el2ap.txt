Tacit knowledge, particularly as it relates to laboratory practice, is
often undervalued within the social sciences and humanities (SSH). This
undervaluation is primarily attributed to the more tangible and material
nature of research practices in the biological sciences, where learning
through imitation is more readily observable. In contrast, research practices
in SSH are generally perceived as relying on rational processes
that lack direct material manifestation. Nevertheless, mimetic learning also plays
a significant role in the training of researchers in SSH,
as demonstrated, for instance, when novice students acquire interview skills
by observing and replicating the methods and techniques employed by
experienced researchers.
