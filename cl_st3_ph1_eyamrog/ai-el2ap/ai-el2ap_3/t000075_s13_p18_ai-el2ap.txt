Regarding domestic impacts, prior to the 2008 crisis, the impulse-response
functions indicate that net restrictions on capital inflows increased monetary
policy autonomy and reduced upward pressure on exchange rates, although
these effects were mixed and often not statistically significant. Conversely,
net loosening of outflow controls was associated with reduced monetary
policy autonomy in emerging economies. In the post-crisis period (2008â€“2011),
regression results suggest that net restrictions on inflows continued to
enhance monetary policy autonomy, but to a lesser extent, while
net loosening of outflow controls did not have a significant
impact on the trilemma variables. This diminished effectiveness of capital
controls is primarily attributed to the global environment of high
liquidity during this period (Pasricha et al., 2018).
