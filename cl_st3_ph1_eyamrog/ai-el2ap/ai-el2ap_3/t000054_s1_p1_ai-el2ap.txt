In Latin America, the regionâ€™s significant biodiversity is linked to
the presence of extensive, largely unexplored areas and the existence
of indigenous populations, including some uncontacted groups. While a wide
variety of life forms have been preserved over time, there
are notable risks of genetic erosion resulting from unsustainable exploitation,
as well as concerns regarding the appropriation of biological resources
by institutions and individuals, often to the detriment of local
communities, their lifestyles, and cultural practices. This article aims to
examine these issues through a review of documentary sources published
by various authors. The examples discussed illustrate that the region
has the potential to utilize its biodiversity for development within
a bioeconomy framework, in which scientific, educational, and productive sectors
collaborate, supported by government policies that prioritize environmental protection, respect
for indigenous populations, and the legal safeguarding of cultural and
biological heritage.
