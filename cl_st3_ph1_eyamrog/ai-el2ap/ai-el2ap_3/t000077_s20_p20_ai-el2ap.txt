The primary finding to note is that the inclusion of
Types of Work F.E., or labor activities fixed effects, leads
to a significant reduction in almost all coefficients, as shown
in column (4). This outcome indicates that the composition effect
related to the distribution of labor force participation across different
labor activities explains a substantial portion of the observed differences
in the probabilities of engaging in remote work.
