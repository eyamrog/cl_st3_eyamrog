The time intervals established for seed collection (days after anthesis,
DAA), based on the maturation and viability curve, facilitated the
analyses conducted in this study and supported their application in
protocols for seed multiplication and the generation of nodular cultures
(Guerra & Dal Vesco 2010; Dal Vesco et al. 2014a).
The water content measured in V. reitzii seeds in this
study indicated the occurrence of a natural desiccation process, which
is directly associated with the seeds’ physiological maturity. Based on
this observation, it can be inferred that the seeds of
this species exhibit orthodox behavior. In orthodox species, seed moisture
content decreases during maturation on the mother plant, resulting in
natural desiccation and conferring tolerance to artificial desiccation (Dousseau et
al. 2011). Although water content can vary when classifying orthodox
seeds, Engelmann and Dussert (2000) report that moisture content should
remain between 10% and 20%. Walters (2015) further indicates that
water content should be below 0.1 g H2O g⁻¹ at
the time of conservation, which must be achieved through artificial
desiccation. Therefore, the data support the classification of V. reitzii
seeds as orthodox with respect to moisture content, as defined
by these authors.
