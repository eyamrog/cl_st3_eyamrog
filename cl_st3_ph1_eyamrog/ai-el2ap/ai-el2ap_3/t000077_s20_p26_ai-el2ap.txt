Regarding gender, controlling for labor activities also resulted in a
reduction in the coefficient; however, an independent effect remains, with
men being 2.19 percentage points less likely to engage in
remote work compared to women. Brussevich et al. (2020) similarly
report that men, on average, are less likely than women
to participate in occupations that can be performed remotely, a
finding primarily attributed to differences in occupational and sectoral selection
between male and female workers. Nevertheless, the presence of a
negative independent effect for men may be associated with the
persistent gender division of domestic labor in Brazil, where responsibilities
related to family assistance and child rearing predominantly fall on
women. Duarte and Spinelli (2019) indicate that, in 2017, women
spent approximately 20.9 hours per week on domestic and caregiving
activities, compared to 10.8 hours for men, with this disparity
persisting across all educational levels.
