The concept of mimesis, originating from its etymological roots, is
primarily associated with imitation and representation (Gebauer and Wulf, 2004).
The process of learning through imitation, whether explicitly connected to
mimesis or not, has been extensively examined by various researchers
and authors across multiple disciplines within the cultural and human
sciences (CHS). It can be argued that imitation and education
are fundamentally interconnected within Western culture (Carvalho, 2019). According to
Christoph Wulf (2016), both children and adults primarily acquire social
behaviors through mimetic processes. This form of learning frequently occurs
through participation in rites and rituals, wherein knowledge is transmitted
through embodied actions.
