In the context of investigating Siluriform fish monogeneans from Lake
Tanganyika, two new species of the genus Bagrobdella were described
from Auchenoglanis occidentalis. Bagrobdella vanhovei sp. nov. is distinguished by
the morphology of its male copulatory organ (MCO), which possesses
a unique terminal opening. Bagrobdella vansteenbergei sp. nov. is characterized
by the nearly uniform size of its hooks and by
a male copulatory organ with a distinctive sub-terminal opening and
the absence of a surrounding membrane.
