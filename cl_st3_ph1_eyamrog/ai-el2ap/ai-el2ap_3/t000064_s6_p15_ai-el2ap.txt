The carbon assimilation rates observed in Vellozia squamata are relatively
low compared to other Cerrado species (Palhares et al. 2010)
and, according to Nogueira et al. (2004), are more characteristic
of secondary rather than pioneer plants. Despite the species' high
seed production and germinability, the successful establishment of Vellozia squamata
appears to depend on complex ecological interactions. This finding underscores
the importance of conserving this species in its natural habitat,
as the seedlings obtained in this study exhibited very slow
growth rates.
