In Excerpt 8, Mr. Martinez raises another objection, asserting that
the defendant’s response does not address the question, “What is
it that you’re learning?” In this instance, Ms. Willmott’s subsequent
formulation of the question does not exhibit any preservation of
the original content; instead, it demonstrates both deletion and transformation,
as seen in her revised question: “What was Mr. Alexander’s
description of premarital, LDS if you want premarital sex?” The
original question is entirely replaced with a new, more specific
inquiry. Following several unsuccessful attempts to elicit a response without
triggering objections from the prosecutor, Ms. Willmott opts to restate
her question in a direct yes/no format, thereby reducing the
likelihood of further objections to the defendant’s answer.
