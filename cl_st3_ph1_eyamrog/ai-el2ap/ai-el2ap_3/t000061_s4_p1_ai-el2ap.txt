Based on the theoretical arguments and data presented, it can
be concluded that mimetic behavior plays a central role in
the experience facilitated by USR and may serve as a
significant resource for the moral development of individuals. Consistent with
Benjamin's (1985) perspective, this resource has the potential to engage
the aesthetic dimension, which is frequently undervalued in formal education
settings. Furthermore, its importance increases in environments characterized by the
proliferation of control norms that are often disconnected from the
interests and needs of the CHS field.
