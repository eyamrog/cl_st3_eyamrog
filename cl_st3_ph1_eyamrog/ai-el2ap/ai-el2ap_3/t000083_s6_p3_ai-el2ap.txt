The original study identified six factors using only exploratory factor
analysis (EFA). In contrast, the present study employed both EFA
and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), demonstrating a good fit for
structural equation models and satisfactory reliability, as indicated by Cronbach's
α and McDonald's ω coefficients.
