The majority of studies have examined the circumstances in developed
countries. Among the limited research focusing on developing countries, Gottlieb
et al. (2021) assessed the capacity for working from home
(WFH) in Armenia, Bolivia, China, Colombia, Georgia, Ghana, Kenya, Laos,
Macedonia, and Vietnam. Their findings indicate that the ability to
WFH is generally low in these countries and is strongly
associated with per capita income. Additionally, there is substantial heterogeneity
both across and within occupations, as well as among different
worker characteristics, with vulnerable groups being less likely to have
the option to work remotely.
