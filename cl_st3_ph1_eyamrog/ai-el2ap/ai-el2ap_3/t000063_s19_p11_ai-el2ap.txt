Analysis of the responses from participants who altered their career
plans due to the pandemic, categorized by area of knowledge,
revealed that 23% of adolescents intending to pursue science-related fields
(natural sciences, mathematics, and statistics), representing 6.2% of the total
sample, changed their study intentions. Among those interested in health
care careers, 28% (22.2% of the total sample) reported a
change in their plans. In contrast, 20.0% of adolescents aiming
for careers unrelated to the natural sciences or health sciences,
who comprised 71.6% of the total sample, indicated a change
in their study intentions as a result of the pandemic
(Fig. 4a, b).
