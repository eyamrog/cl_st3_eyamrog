Remarks. Bagrobdella vansteenbergei can be distinguished from all previously described
species by the relative uniformity in the length of its
hooks, with all pairs being nearly equal in size and
pair I only slightly longer than the others. In contrast,
other described species, including B. vanhovei sp. nov., exhibit hooks
of varying lengths (Fig. 10). Additionally, the trapezoidal piece was
not observed in any of the 17 examined individuals (15
mounted in Hoyerâ€™s medium and 2 preserved in ethanol), suggesting
its absence in this species, although it is typically only
slightly sclerotised and may be difficult to detect. The ventral
anchors are characterized by slight perforations. The male copulatory organ
of B. vansteenbergei is unique within Bagrobdella spp., exhibiting a
subterminal opening and lacking a surrounding membrane (Fig. 11).
