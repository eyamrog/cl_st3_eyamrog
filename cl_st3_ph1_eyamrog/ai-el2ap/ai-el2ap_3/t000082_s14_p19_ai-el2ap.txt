We characterized network structure by calculating two commonly used metrics:
nestedness and modularity (Almeida-Neto et al. 2008; Blondel et al.
2008). For each simulation, we quantified the number of interaction
losses resulting from coevolutionary dynamics at the conclusion of the
simulation, denoted as F. To assess structural changes, we calculated
two indices: ΔNODF, representing the change in nestedness, and ΔQ,
representing the change in modularity. Both indices were computed as
the difference between the respective metric values at the end
and at the beginning of each simulation.
