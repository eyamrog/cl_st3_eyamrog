Culicid specimens were collected in nature reserves across 18 municipalities
in the state of Paraná between 1967 and 1999 (Figure
1). The Dense Ombrophilous Forest phytogeographic region is the primary
source of samples, accounting for 4,831 specimens, with the municipality
of Morretes contributing 4,774 (98%) of these records. This region
has been frequently utilized for culicid collection by various researchers
due to the presence of extensive conservation areas [1–4]. Over
the 30-year study period, specimen identifications were performed and verified
by taxonomists within the research group, including Dr. Ana Lozovei,
as well as collaborators Dr. Samira Chahad-Ehlers, Dr. Luiz Gonzaga
dos Santos-Neto, and Dr. Adson Luís Sant’Ana, who are co-authors
of this article. Additionally, some identifications were confirmed by Dr.
Maria Anice Mureb Sallum from the Public Health Faculty of
the University of São Paulo. The Parasitology Collection of the
Basic Pathology Department is integrated into the Information System on
Brazilian Biodiversity (SiBBr) and is accessible at https://collectory.sibbr.gov.br/collectory/public/show/co446.
