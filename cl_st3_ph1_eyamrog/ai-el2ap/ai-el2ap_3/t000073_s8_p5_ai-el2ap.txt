Paraguay consists of two distinct geographical regions, the eastern and
western regions, which are separated by the Paraguay River. The
western region, also known as the Chaco, comprises three ecoregions:
the Humid Chaco, the Dry Chaco, and the Pantanal. In
contrast, the ecoregions of eastern Paraguay include the Humid Chaco,
the Atlantic Forest, and the Cerrado (Dinerstein et al. 1995).
