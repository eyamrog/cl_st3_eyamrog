According to Adorno and Horkheimer (1985), the drive for self-preservation
constitutes the archaic basis of mimetic behavior. In early human
societies, mimesis functioned as a mechanism to mitigate fear of
the unfamiliar, the unknown, and the potentially threatening; through imitation
or enactment, individuals reduced the perceived difference between themselves and
the source of their fear. Practices such as mythology, magical
rituals, and dances served as means to assimilate the unknown,
rendering it less intimidating by incorporating it into various forms
of symbolic expression (Gagnebin, 1993).
