This bibliographic study analyzed data from LILACS for the years
2015 to 2019, focusing on journals that published at least
50 articles with at least one identified individual author (“signed
articles”). In January 2022, the iAH (Interface for Access on
Health Information) search interface within BIREME’s Virtual Health Library was
used to retrieve all documents indexed as journal articles during
the specified period. In May 2022, BIREME supplied a database
containing journal information, including abbreviated journal titles, LILACS indexing status,
and subject classifications based on Health Sciences Descriptors (DeCS). All
data were downloaded in ISO 2709 format and imported into
the R statistical environment version 4.2.1 (R Core Team 2022)
using the stringi package version 1.7.8 (Gagolewski 2022) and custom
code developed for this study (Fontenelle 2022). The dataset was
subsequently filtered to include only signed articles from journals that
were systematically indexed and met the minimum publication threshold.
