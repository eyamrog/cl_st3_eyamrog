In the final section, a discourse of German unity emerges,
which is latent and situated at the level of distal,
previously articulated statements. This discourse is linked to concerns about
national security, as reflected in the phrase “das große Glück,
das unser Land seit über dreißig Jahren genießt” (“the great
fortune our country has enjoyed for over thirty years”) and
the suggestion that the thirty years of German unity could
represent a “historical exception.” In response to this perceived threat,
Scholz emphasizes the necessity of maintaining the cohesion of the
European Union, strengthening NATO, and fostering closer relations with international
allies, as indicated by his statement: “müssen wir alles tun
für den Zusammenhalt der Europäischen Union, für die Stärke der
NATO, für noch engere Beziehungen zu unseren Freunden, Partnern und
Gleichgesinnten weltweit” (“we must do everything we can to maintain
the cohesion of the European Union, the strength of NATO,
to forge even closer relations with our friends, our partners
and all those who share our convictions worldwide”). This position
excludes discourses critical of NATO and normalizes the perspective that
a strong NATO is indispensable for German national security.
