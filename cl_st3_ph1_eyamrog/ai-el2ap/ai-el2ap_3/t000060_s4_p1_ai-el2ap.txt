The findings indicate that all types of formulation properties—preservation, deletion,
and transformation—were employed, either individually or in combination, with transformation
being the most prevalent. The cross-examining lawyer occasionally preserved the
defendant’s words verbatim, as in the instance where “that makes
sense” was repeated, although in the second occurrence, the demonstrative
“that” was replaced with the pronoun “it,” reflecting a grammatical
substitution. At other times, the lawyer omitted certain elements of
the original statement; however, the predominant strategy involved transforming the
defendant’s words. Through these transformations, the lawyer presented a rephrased
version of the defendant’s statements, thereby framing the interpretation and
implicitly encouraging the audience to accept his perspective.
