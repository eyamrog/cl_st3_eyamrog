When linguists formulate research questions and determine appropriate investigative approaches,
numerous decisions are required throughout the research design process. It
is essential that the chosen methodology aligns with the objectives
of the study. A corpus linguistics methodological perspective may be
particularly suitable when the research questions pertain to patterns of
language use across various contexts, as noted by Crawford and
Csomay.
