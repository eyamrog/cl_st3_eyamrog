Current research is beginning to elucidate how interactions involving cheaters
can influence evolutionary patterns in mutualisms, as the roles of
species as either cheaters or mutualists may impact coevolution and
local adaptation. For instance, the relationship between the plant Lithophragma
parviflorum (Saxifragaceae) and the floral-parasitic moth Greya politella shifts from
parasitism to mutualism in the absence of L. parviflorum’s legitimate
pollinators within the community (Thompson & Cunningham 2002). A major
challenge in studying the evolutionary consequences of ecological interactions at
the community level is that pairwise interactions are not independent
but instead influence one another within ecological networks. Cheating interactions
are characterized by a negative effect on one partner and
a positive effect on the other. In this context, evolutionary
changes can propagate through indirect effects (Guimarães et al. 2017),
thereby influencing the evolution of species traits and ultimately shaping
species interactions within the community. Due to the non-random structure
of interaction networks, central species are particularly important for maintaining
network structure and, as a result, for stabilizing selection pressures
among species within the network (Martín Gonzáles et al. 2010).
Nevertheless, the effects of central cheaters on mutualistic coevolutionary dynamics
remain poorly understood.
