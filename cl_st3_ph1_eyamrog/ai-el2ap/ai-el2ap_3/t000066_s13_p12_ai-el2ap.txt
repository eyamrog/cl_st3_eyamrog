For this specific workshop, the facilitators opted to conduct a
play-and-talk session designed to encourage participants to use English in
a variety of interactive settings, rather than delivering a one-hour
lecture, which is not consistent with GPB practices. Nevertheless, there
was a possibility that the session could revert to a
lecture format due to participantsâ€™ inhibitions, as the learners involved
were not accustomed to interacting with strangers in English. The
workshop comprised five interconnected activities that integrated play and discussion,
with the aim of addressing core principles such as collaboration,
affect, and agency within both the conversational and play-based components.
