For example, when editors, editorial board members, reviewers, and authors
initially register with a journal’s publishing platform, they are required
to log in using their ORCiD credentials (Fig. 2). To
be designated as the editor of a journal, an additional
ORCiD login is necessary, during which this new role is
added to the individual’s ORCiD profile. ORCiD then provides the
journal with a hyperlinked ORCiD icon, allowing readers and authors
to access information about the editor’s background and qualifications, with
the assurance that identities have been authenticated and that concerns
can be addressed through ORCiD if necessary. While such systems
are not immune to circumvention, as no technology is entirely
secure, the level of effort required to bypass these measures
without detection is significantly increased, and the system can be
further enhanced in response to any violations.
