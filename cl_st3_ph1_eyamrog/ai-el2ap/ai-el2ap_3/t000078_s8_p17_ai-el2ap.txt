All methods that utilize gross employment density (employment per unit
area) are sensitive to the size of the area under
consideration, as larger regions typically exhibit lower density values, which
can complicate the identification of employment subcenters. Furthermore, Mieszkowski and
Smith (1991) note that the use of gross density in
estimation procedures tends to result in inflated coefficient estimates.
