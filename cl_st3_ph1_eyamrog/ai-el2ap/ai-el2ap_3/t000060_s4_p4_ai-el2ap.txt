In both everyday conversation and forensic contexts, the specific circumstances
under which questions and answers are formulated necessitate ongoing facework
in verbal interactions. Given the unpredictability of interlocutors' thoughts and
actions, speakers utilize various mechanisms to protect aspects of themselves
they prefer to keep concealed and to emphasize those they
wish to display. As noted by Flower (2018, p. 31),
facework strategies serve multiple functions, including saving, maintaining, giving, and
threatening face.
