Mollo et al. (2011) reported that in Alcantarea imperialis (Carri√®re)
Harms (Bromeliaceae), carbohydrates exhibit significant alterations in response to cold
conditions. Specifically, the authors observed that sucrose levels in plants
exposed to low temperatures may be replaced by other carbohydrates
such as trehalose, raffinose, and stachyose. Additionally, they found that
starch concentrations varied under cold stress, potentially being converted into
carbohydrates that are associated with enhanced tolerance and protection against
cold.
