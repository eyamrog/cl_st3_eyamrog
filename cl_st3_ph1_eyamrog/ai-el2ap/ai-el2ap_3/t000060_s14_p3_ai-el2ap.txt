This study adopts an empirical-inductive approach, as the texts analyzed
were derived from authentic instances of language use, and all
occurrences were systematically examined to inform our qualitative interpretations. The
data are presented to accurately reflect how language was produced
in real-life interactions, specifically highlighting features of local verbal planning,
where planning and speaking occurred simultaneously. In analyzing these cases,
we considered a range of possible meanings and interpretations, which
informed the theoretical framework applied in this research. To delimit
the corpus, we selected types of formulations, politeness strategies, and
facework that were most relevant for analysis, focusing on devices
frequently employed by speakers to achieve communicative goals. The recurrence
of these devices served as the primary criterion for data
selection. Subsequently, the selected excerpts were organized chronologically, encompassing material
from the video recording of the final day of the
prosecutor’s cross-examination (Day 25) at Maricopa County Superior Court in
Phoenix, Arizona, on February 21, 2013, as well as a
reporter’s transcript of proceedings (testimony of Jodi Ann Arias) on
November 3, 2014. The excerpts obtained from the video were
transcribed following the conventions outlined by Leite (2017, pp. 21–22).
