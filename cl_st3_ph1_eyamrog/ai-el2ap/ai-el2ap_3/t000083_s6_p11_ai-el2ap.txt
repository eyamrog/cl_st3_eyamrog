The primary limitations of this study are related to the
sample, which is not representative of Brazilian adolescents and includes
only adolescent participants. Therefore, future research should employ larger and
more diverse samples encompassing various age groups and genders. Additionally,
although multiple criteria were utilized to assess the content validity
of the SBS, the absence of a gold standard limits
the comprehensive verification of the construct.
