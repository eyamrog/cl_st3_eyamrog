In Brazil, the regulation of research has been met with
considerable and justified resistance from researchers in the Social Sciences
and Humanities (SSH), particularly in response to Resolution No. 510/2016
issued by the National Health Council (NHC). Although this resolution
serves as the primary regulatory framework for SSH research in
the country, it originates from a health-focused institution. As a
result, the NHC regulation does not adequately account for the
methodological specificities and ethical considerations that have been developed within
SSH disciplines, which are based on the unique characteristics and
requirements of these scientific fields.
