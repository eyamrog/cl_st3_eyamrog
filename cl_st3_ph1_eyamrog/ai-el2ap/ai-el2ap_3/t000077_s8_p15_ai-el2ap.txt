Yasenov (2020) analyzed the US labor market and found that
lower-paid workers are up to three times less likely to
be able to work from home; consequently, remote work is
less accessible to individuals with lower levels of education, younger
workers, ethnic minorities, and immigrants. Similarly, Bartik et al. (2020)
reported that in the United States, remote work is significantly
more prevalent in industries that employ workers who are better
educated and receive higher wages.
