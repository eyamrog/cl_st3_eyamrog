There is a growing body of literature examining the phenomenon
of frequent selfie-taking, sometimes referred to as "selfitis," which is
characterized by the recurrent desire to take photographs of oneself
using a smartphone and share them on social media platforms
(McLean et al., 2019). This behavior is particularly prevalent among
adolescents and young adults and has been observed globally (Griffiths
and Balakrishnan, 2018; Lin et al., 2019; McLean et al.,
2019). Selfitis-related activities typically include preparing and staging the image,
editing aspects such as color and background, selecting the most
favorable image, posting it online, and subsequently monitoring and evaluating
the number of "likes" and comments received (Balakrishnan and Griffiths,
2017; McLean et al., 2019). Approximately half of the global
population, estimated at 7.6 billion, uses some form of social
media, with reports suggesting that over 170 million selfies are
shared daily (Kemp, 2018). This results in a substantial volume
of selfies posted worldwide each day. The prevalence of selfie-sharing
varies across platforms; for instance, on Snapchat, 74% of all
images shared are selfies (Reilly et al., 2019). It should
be noted, however, that claims regarding the American Psychiatric Association
(APA) officially recognizing "selfitis" as a mental disorder are not
supported by current APA publications or diagnostic manuals (Vincent, 2014).
