Vriesea reitzii is an endemic bromeliad species from the Atlantic
Rainforest. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of seed
cryopreservation by direct immersion in liquid nitrogen, using seeds collected
from capsules at 120, 135, and 150 days after anthesis
(DAA). Seed water content was measured prior to cryopreservation, while
germination percentage, germination speed index (GSI), and total soluble carbohydrate
content were assessed following cryopreservation. Seeds collected at 120 DAA
exhibited the highest moisture content (17.6%), whereas seeds collected at
150 DAA demonstrated the highest germination percentage (89.6%) and GSI
(17.0). Optical and transmission electron microscopy analyses revealed no evidence
of cellular damage or alterations at the morpho-histological or ultrastructural
levels after cryopreservation. These findings indicate that V. reitzii seeds
exhibit orthodox storage behavior and that cryopreservation by direct immersion
in liquid nitrogen is an effective method for the ex
situ conservation of this species.
