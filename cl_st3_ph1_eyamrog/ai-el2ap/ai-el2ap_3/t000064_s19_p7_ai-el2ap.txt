Regarding stomatal distribution, V. squamata leaves were amphistomatic, with stomata
on the abaxial surface predominantly located within crypts that extended
to approximately one-quarter of the leaf thickness (Figure 6a). These
characteristics were most pronounced in the control group and in
plants cultivated in the garden. In contrast, in vitro plantlets
did not develop stomatal crypts, and their stomata were rudimentary
(Figure 6d). Furthermore, plants grown in the greenhouse exhibited smaller
and shallower crypts (Figure 6e) compared to field-grown plants (control
group), which possessed fully developed stomata (Figure 6a).
