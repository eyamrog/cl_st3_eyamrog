Stokoe and Edwards (2010, pp. 155–156) state that the diverse
interactional contexts within legal institutions, such as courtrooms, police stations,
emergency services, prisons, legal documents, and lawyers’ offices, have served

since the inception of these fields. They further assert that
interactions occurring in settings such as courtrooms can represent highly
consequential events in individuals’ lives.
