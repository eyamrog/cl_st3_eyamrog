The number of samples used for infiltration measurements was deemed
sufficient based on the stabilization of the median values (Figure
3). The median infiltration capacity was 893 mm hr⁻¹ (Figure
4). The mean soil penetration resistance (± standard deviation) for
the four measured depths was 0.63 ± 0.21 MPa, 0.66
± 0.32 MPa, 0.74 ± 0.22 MPa, and 0.76 ±
0.22 MPa, respectively (Figure 5). Soil penetration resistance increased significantly
with depth, a pattern consistent with previous findings in a
forest within the Brazilian savanna (Pereira et al. 2021). The
observed penetration resistance values were lower than those reported for
a nearby savanna (locally referred to as “Cerrado típico”) in
the same region (Murta et al. 2021). This difference in
soil penetration resistance between the riparian forest and the savanna
may be explained by the greater and more continuous litter
input in the forest throughout the year (Costa et al.
2020). For instance, Aquino et al. (2016) reported an average
litter input of 6 ton ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ in a riparian
forest, whereas Valenti et al. (2008) found 0.6 ton ha⁻¹
year⁻¹ in a savanna.
