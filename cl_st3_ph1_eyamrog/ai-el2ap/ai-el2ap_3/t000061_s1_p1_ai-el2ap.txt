Research ethics has been subject to extensive regulation, predominantly guided
by a model derived from the biomedical sciences. Within this
primarily normative framework for addressing moral issues, this article seeks
to present arguments regarding the potential for research practice to
contribute to moral development. To this end, the study integrates
theoretical analysis—focusing on the concept of mimesis as developed by
Adorno and Benjamin—with an examination of responses to an online
questionnaire completed by undergraduate students in the humanities and social
sciences who have participated in undergraduate scientific research (USR). The
findings support the view that USR possesses significant formative potential,
serving as a valuable context for analyzing mimetic behavior and
facilitating the acquisition of moral concepts by novices through observation
and practical engagement in research activities.
