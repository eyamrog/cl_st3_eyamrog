After controlling for intrinsic property characteristics, amenities, and access to
transportation, we considered a sub-center to be valid if the
distance from each property to each SBD identified in the
first stage was statistically significant and exhibited a negative coefficient.
This identification strategy enables inferences regarding the presence of SBDs
and facilitates the evaluation of whether the hedonic price model
for the real estate market aligns with the predictions of
theoretical models.
