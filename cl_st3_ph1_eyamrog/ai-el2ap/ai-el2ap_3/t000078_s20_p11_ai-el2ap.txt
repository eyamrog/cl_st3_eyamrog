The results obtained from the estimation of Equation 1, which
controls for SBD and is conducted using OLS (Table 4,
columns 5-8), are consistent with urban theoretical models that predict
a decreasing price gradient. This consistency holds across both functional
forms and specifications of the CBD variable. However, tests for
spatial randomness reject the null hypothesis, indicating the presence of
spatial dependence. As a result, the OLS estimates and associated
statistical tests may be unreliable. To address this limitation, the
econometric model is re-estimated using the SLX estimator.
