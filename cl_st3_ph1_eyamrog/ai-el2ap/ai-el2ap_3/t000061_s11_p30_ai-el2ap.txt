The relationship between mimesis and education can also be examined
through the etymological origin of the verb "to educate" (educare,
from Latin), which denotes the act of leading (ducere) the
child out of (e-, ex) themselves (Martins, 2005) and preparing
them to engage with the world. In this context, the
educational process can be understood as a formative and guiding
activity.
