Light response curves were generated by analyzing two leaves per
plant from five individual plants per treatment, resulting in a
total of ten measurements per treatment. For each leaf, the
relationship between light intensity and net carbon assimilation rate (A,
µmol CO2 m⁻² s⁻¹) was determined using a portable infrared
gas analyzer (IRGA; model LI-6400XT, LI-COR Bioscience®). Because the leaves
of in vitro plantlets and recently rooted seedlings were smaller
than the IRGA leaf chamber, all measurements were adjusted based
on the actual leaf area to ensure accuracy.
