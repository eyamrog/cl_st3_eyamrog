An individual maintains face when his projected line aligns with
the expectations of other participants; that is, when he presents
an image that corresponds to the assumptions and evaluations of
the interactants and is validated by the line he adopts.
Face is not an inherent or physical attribute of the
individual but is instead distributed throughout the sequence of social
interactions, emerging when participants are prepared to interpret the judgments
conveyed during these encounters.
