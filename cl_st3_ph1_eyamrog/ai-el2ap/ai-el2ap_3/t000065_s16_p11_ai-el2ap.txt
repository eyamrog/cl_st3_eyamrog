The majority of samples in the corpus originate from students
enrolled in courses within the Physical Sciences and Engineering, as
well as Biological and Health Sciences. In contrast, the Humanities
and Arts represent the discipline area with the fewest samples
(see Figure 2). This distribution is likely attributable to the
comparatively lower total enrollment of students from Humanities and Arts,
as well as Social Sciences and Education, in English for
Academic Purposes courses relative to those from the Biological and
Hard Sciences fields.
