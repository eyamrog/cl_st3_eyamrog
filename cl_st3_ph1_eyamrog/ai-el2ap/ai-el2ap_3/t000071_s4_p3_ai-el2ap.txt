If a publicly accessible and reliable framework for assessing journal
legitimacy can be established, services such as Cabells may be
able to redirect their efforts from compiling lists of potentially
problematic journals to more actively supporting journals in need of
corrections and improvements, while continuing to identify and address intentional
deception and fraud. The work of Jeffrey Beall and Cabells
International has highlighted the necessity for effective mechanisms to verify
and communicate journal compliance with scholarly standards, particularly in the
context of open access publishing and increasing global participation in
research.
