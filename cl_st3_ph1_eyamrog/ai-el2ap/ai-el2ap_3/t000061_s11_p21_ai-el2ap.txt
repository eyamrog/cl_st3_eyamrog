Given the characteristics of Undergraduate Scientific Research (USR), it can
be characterized as an entry process into the academic environment.
The term "initiation" in this context refers not only to
the commencement of an activity but also encompasses the idea
of a structured process involving the acquisition of foundational knowledge
and skills. According to the Houaiss dictionary (2020), initiation is
defined as "the act of giving or receiving the first
elements of a practice or the rudiments relating to an
area of knowledge," such as "scientific initiation." In the context
of USR, students are introduced to scientific research practices and
engage in activities related to a research project, which is
designed and supervised by a faculty member (Massi and Queiroz,
2010: 175).
