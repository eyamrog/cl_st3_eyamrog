The cost of this process is considerable. It can be
characterized as the transformation of original mimesis—which is simultaneously pleasurable
and threatening—into a perverse form of mimesis that manifests in
the subject's insensitivity and rigidity. This transformation reflects the severity
of the adaptation required to function in the real world
and, following Freud, the transition from childhood to adulthood. The
second form of mimesis is constructed upon the repression of
the first; it typifies individuals who have resisted the temptation
to regress but, in doing so, have lost the flexibility
and vitality associated with original life, and in some cases,
have lost vitality altogether (Gagnebin, 1993, p. 73).
