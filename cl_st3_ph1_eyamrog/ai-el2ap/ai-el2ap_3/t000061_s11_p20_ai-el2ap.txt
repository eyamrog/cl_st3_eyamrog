The process initiated by the first mimesis is essential for
the development of moral behavior in Adorno's framework. According to
Adorno, morality is grounded in an impulse to prevent suffering
(Adorno, 2009). During the initial stage of mimetic behavior, characterized
by a lack of clear distinction between the subject and
nature, individuals are able to experience feelings of contiguity, familiarity,
and, most notably, solidarity with the suffering of others. As
Adorno states, “The impulse, the naked and raw physical fear
and the feeling of solidarity with bodies torturous, to use
Brecht's expression, the impulse that is immanent to moral behavior
[...]” (Adorno, 2009: 238).
