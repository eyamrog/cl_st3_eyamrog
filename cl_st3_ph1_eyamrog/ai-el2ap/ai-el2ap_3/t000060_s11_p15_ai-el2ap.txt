An adjacency pair is defined as a sequence of two
utterances that are contiguous, produced by different speakers, organized as
a first part and a second part, and categorized such
that the first part necessitates a specific second part or
a limited set of possible second parts (Heritage, 1984a, p.
246). For example, an invitation constitutes the first part of
an invitation–response pair, a question serves as the first part
of a question–answer pair, and a greeting functions as the
first part of a greeting–greeting pair.
