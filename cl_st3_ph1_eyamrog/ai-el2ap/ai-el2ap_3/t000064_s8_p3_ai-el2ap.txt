Vellozia squamata Pohl, also referred to by its synonym Vellozia
flavicans Mart ex Schult (Smith & Ayensu 1974), is a
common species in the Cerrado of central Brazil (Flora do
Brasil 2020). Attempts to obtain seedlings from seeds of this
species have been unsuccessful due to high mortality rates among
young plants (Neto 2009), a pattern observed in other Vellozia
species as well (Alves 1994). Additionally, efforts to produce seedlings
through stem cuttings have also been unsuccessful (Neto 2009).
