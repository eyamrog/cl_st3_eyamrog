This study demonstrates that at a distance of approximately 30
meters from the watercourse, there is no statistically significant difference
in species diversity. The primary factors distinguishing the border from
the interior region are the number of individuals and the
composition of ecological groups. An ecological equilibrium between fauna and
flora is observed, as the majority of cataloged plant species
are animal-dispersed. Consequently, the conservation of natural fragments is essential
for maintaining both plant and animal species, as well as
for providing propagules for the restoration of degraded areas. Analysis
of the seed bank in the study area indicates that
the fragment possesses considerable potential to supply propagules or facilitate
litter transposition for ecological restoration, due to its recognized floristic
diversity.
