Analysis of the seed bank composition can inform the development
of more effective management strategies for native forests and ecological
restoration. Additionally, seed bank assessments can serve as ecological indicators
for the evaluation and monitoring of regeneration processes in degraded
ecosystems (Neto et al. 2010, 2014; Bargoena et al. 2020;
Costa et al. 2020).
