Pearson's correlation matrix was employed to assess the degree of
association among the factors. Overall, correlation coefficients greater than 0.50
were observed between all factors. Notably, the "social competition" factor
demonstrated strong correlations with "attention seeking" (r = 0.79), "mood
and confidence" (r = 0.80), and "subjective conformity" (r =
0.81). Additionally, a strong correlation was identified between "attention seeking"
and "subjective conformity" (r = 0.80), as well as between
"mood and confidence" and "subjective conformity" (r = 0.82), as
shown in Table 2.
