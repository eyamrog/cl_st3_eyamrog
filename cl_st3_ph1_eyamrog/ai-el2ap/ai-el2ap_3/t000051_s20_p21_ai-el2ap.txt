This section constitutes the longest part of the speech. In
it, Scholz integrates the previously introduced themes of a watershed
moment and Putin’s war to assert that Putin “will ein
russisches Imperium errichten” (“wants to build a Russian empire”). Scholz
substantiates this assertion by employing a strategy of negative evaluation
of Putin’s perspective, referencing Putin’s “historisierende Abhandlungen” (“historicising essays”), his
televised declaration of war, and personal conversations between Scholz and
Putin. Scholz then presents this perspective through the dialogically contractive
statement “kann keinen Zweifel mehr haben” (“can no longer have
any doubt”), which frames his conclusion as the only reasonable
interpretation. The legitimacy of this conclusion is further reinforced by
the dialogically contractive endorsement “Das sehen wir heute in der
Ukraine” (“We can see that today in Ukraine”) and by
Scholz’s judgement that Putin “schreckt er nicht zurück vor militärischer
Gewalt” (“has no qualms about using military force”).
