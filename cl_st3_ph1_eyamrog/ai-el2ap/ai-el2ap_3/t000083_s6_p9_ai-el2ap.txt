The results of the present study indicate that the SCS
is a valid instrument for assessing selfie-taking behavior, contributing to
the emerging field of research on digital technology use. As
the first Brazilian study to address selfie-taking behavior, it expands
the existing literature on disorders associated with digital technology and
media use. Beyond identifying potential psychological consequences of selfie-taking behavior,
whether positive or negative, this study offers a foundation for
future research to further examine the construct in diverse contexts
and populations. Additional studies are warranted to investigate the factors
involved in the acquisition, development, and maintenance of selfiitis behavior,
including personality traits, motivations, cognitive processes, and attitudes.
