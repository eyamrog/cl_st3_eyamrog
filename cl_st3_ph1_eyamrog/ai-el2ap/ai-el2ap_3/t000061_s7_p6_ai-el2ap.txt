The selection of Undergraduate Scientific Research (USR) as the initial
phase of the researcher's professional development is based on the
observation that, although undergraduate students engage in research activities throughout
their academic programs, USR represents the most structured and significant
form of scientific research training. This is primarily because USR
is systematically organized and supervised by an experienced researcher, and
it involves participation in an authentic research environment. This rationale
is supported by the regulatory framework of the Institutional Program
for Scientific Initiation Scholarships (PIBIC), which is the oldest and
most enduring public policy promoting USR in Brazil and serves
as a model for other USR initiatives. According to Normative
Resolution No. 017/2006 of the National Council for Scientific and
Technological Development (CNPq), the objective of USR is to "awaken
a scientific vocation and encourage potential talent among university undergraduate
students through participation in a research project, guided by a
qualified researcher" (Brazil, 2006).
