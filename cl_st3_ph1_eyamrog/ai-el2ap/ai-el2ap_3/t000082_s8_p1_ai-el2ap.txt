Selection resulting from ecological interactions is a major factor influencing
phenotypic patterns across various levels of biological organization (Thompson 2005).
Such selection contributes to trait matching between interacting individuals (Zhang
et al. 2012), affects trait distributions within interacting populations (Bronstein
et al. 2003), influences trait variation among populations of the
same species (Thompson 2005), and shapes trait patterns at the
community level (Strauss & Irwin 2004). At the community level,
ecological interactions can promote both trait convergence (Wilson et al.
2012) and trait disparity (Siepielski & Benkman 2010). Both theoretical
and empirical studies suggest that different types of ecological interactions,
such as mutualistic and antagonistic relationships, may lead to distinct
trait patterns within communities (Thompson 1994).
