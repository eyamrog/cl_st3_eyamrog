Recent studies conducted along the Brazilian-Bolivian border, specifically in the
municipalities of Brasil√©ia and Xapuri, have documented a high richness
and diversity of sand fly species. Among these, Nyssomyia shawi
(Fraiha, Ward & Ready, 1981) and Trichophoromyia sp. were identified
as the most frequent species and were found to be
infected with Leishmania DNA [3]. These studies also confirmed the
presence of a wide variety of vector species captured in
both domestic and forest environments. Additionally, research in this region
has led to the description of a new species and
the revalidation of certain taxa [16, 17, 18].
