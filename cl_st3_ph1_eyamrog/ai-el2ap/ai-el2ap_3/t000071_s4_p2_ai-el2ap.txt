This study contributes to the existing literature on predatory journals
by providing empirical evidence and rationale for addressing transparency issues
in scholarly publishing. The development of verification systems for publishing
platforms, in collaboration with reputable trade organizations, establishes higher standards
for both the operators of predatory journals and those who
may misuse the predatory label. Although the Public Knowledge Project
(PKP) is currently leading these initiatives, the overall effectiveness of
such systems will depend on their widespread adoption as an
industry standard for journal accountability among publishers and publishing platforms.
Achieving this will require the participation of a diverse range
of journal platforms and scholarly publishers who share the objective
of enabling the public to assess the reliability of research
publications, particularly in the context of increasing open access. The
implementation of verification and authentication standards, designed to communicate publishing
practices clearly to both the public and professionals, is expected
to enhance the distinction between legitimate and deceptive journals.
