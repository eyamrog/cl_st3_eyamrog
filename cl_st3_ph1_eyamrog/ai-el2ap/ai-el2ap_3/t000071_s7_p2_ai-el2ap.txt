Predatory proxies present significant challenges, as they are often applied
to well-established journals, including those considered top-tier (Olivarez et al.,
2018). Some individuals use these proxies to conflate predatory publishing
with open access more generally, reflecting Beall’s documented opposition to
open access (Beall, 2013; Krawczyk & Kulczycki, 2021). Attempts to
directly assess journals’ adherence to rigorous peer review standards have
yielded inconsistent and sometimes questionable results. For instance, Cobey et
al. (2019) reported that 83.3 percent of authors publishing in
journals listed by Beall believed their work had undergone peer
review, a finding that raises concerns about the reliability of
such assessments. In a more systematic investigation, Bohannon (2013) submitted
a deliberately flawed manuscript to 304 journals; among those on
Beall’s list, only 18 percent rejected the paper, compared to
an overall rejection rate of 62.4 percent, and some journals
from major publishers such as Elsevier, Wolters Kluwer, and SAGE
accepted the manuscript. Additionally, some researchers appear to exploit predatory
journals to increase their publication counts and thereby obtain greater
institutional rewards (Demir, 2018; Pyne, 2017). Despite these complexities, there
is a growing consensus that predatory journals constitute a global
threat, as articulated by 35 scholars in Nature (Grudniewicz et
al., 2019), although this perspective may inadvertently hinder the positive
expansion of global research. In response, the scholarly publishing industry
has launched initiatives such as the “Think. Check. Submit.” campaign,
which advises authors to verify the trustworthiness of journals by
considering factors such as familiarity, indexing status, and membership in
recognized trade organizations (Think, n.d.). The campaign acknowledges that some
journals may be misclassified as predatory due to limited resources,
but emphasizes widespread concerns about predatory publishing in the context
of increasing global research output. At the same time, many
researchers are also concerned with advancing open science through open
access, open infrastructure, and related initiatives, which frames the context
for this chapter. Our three-phase study addresses the dual challenges
of fraudulent journals and the mislabeling of legitimate journals as
predatory, both of which undermine scholarly publishing. The study examines
521 journals identified as predatory by Beall and/or Cabells that
also use Open Journal Systems (OJS), an open-source editorial management
and publishing platform. While Beall’s list remains freely accessible, Cabells
Predatory Reports is available only by subscription, which Stanford University
obtained in 2021 at our request. OJS is developed by
the Public Knowledge Project (PKP) at Simon Fraser University and
Stanford University. As members of PKP, we disclose two conflicts
of interest and a sense of responsibility that inform our
research on these journals.
