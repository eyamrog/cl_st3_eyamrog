Anatomical analysis using light microscopy of seeds collected at different
days after anthesis (DAA), subjected to both cryopreservation and non-cryopreservation
treatments, did not reveal evidence of mechanical damage, such as
cell wall rupture or disruption of the membrane system. However,
variations were observed in the histochemical staining patterns, indicating differences
in the distribution or concentration of chemical compounds within the
seed coat, endosperm, aleurone layer, and embryo (Figure 1).
