The mere occurrence of a single turn does not constitute
a conversation, and it is arguable that even two turns
are insufficient for this purpose. A conversation requires more than
two coordinated and cooperative turns that are governed by conditions
of conditional relevance. When a first part of a turn
is produced, a second part is expected, and if it
occurs, it is interpreted as a response to the first.
In this framework, the sequence formed by the first and
second parts constitutes a conversational pair, which is regarded as
the minimal dialogic unit.
