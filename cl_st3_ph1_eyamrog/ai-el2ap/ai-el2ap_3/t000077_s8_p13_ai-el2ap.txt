Gaudecker et al. (2020), using data from the Netherlands, found
that total hours worked declined more significantly among the self-employed,
as firms tend to provide employees with protection against transitory
shocks. Additionally, workers with lower levels of education experienced greater
reductions in hours worked, whereas those with higher education were
more likely to maintain or increase their working hours from
home. The authors categorized economic sectors into two clusters: the
first is characterized by office-based occupations with a high proportion
of highly educated workers, greater feasibility of remote work, and
limited involvement of essential workers; the second cluster is defined
by a predominance of manual tasks and social interactions, lower
participation of highly educated workers, limited opportunities for remote work,
and a higher proportion of essential workers (Gaudecker et al.,
2020).
