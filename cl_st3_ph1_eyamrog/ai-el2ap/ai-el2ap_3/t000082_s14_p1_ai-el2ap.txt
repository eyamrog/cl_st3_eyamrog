Our discrete-time evolutionary model characterizes the change in the mean
trait value of species i (Zi) as a consequence of
selection arising from ecological interactions and other environmental factors, such
as abiotic conditions. In this framework, the evolutionary change in
the trait across generations is determined by the selection differential
(S) and the additive genetic variance of the trait, following
the approach of Lande (1976). We decompose S into three
components that may influence the evolution of trait Z: selection
resulting from (i) mutualistic interactions, (ii) cheating interactions, and (iii)
other environmental factors. For the purposes of this model, we
assume that, within a given interaction, species can be classified
as either mutualistic partners or cheaters; however, a single species
may act as a cheater in its interaction with species
j while simultaneously functioning as a mutualistic partner with species
k.
