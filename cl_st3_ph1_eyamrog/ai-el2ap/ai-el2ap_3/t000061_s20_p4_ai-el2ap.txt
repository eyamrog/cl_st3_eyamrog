The positive outcomes associated with USR may be partially attributed
to the fact that participation in this activity is initiated
by the students themselves. Analysis of the responses indicates that
all participants (100%) engaged in USR on their own initiative,
as exemplified by the following statement: “The USR is your
initiative and you need to go after it” (R26).
