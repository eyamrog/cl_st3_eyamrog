Identification. The species is readily identifiable by its large basidiome,
measuring approximately 10â€“30 cm in height including the spore sac,
and its rapid development. The basidiome is rust-colored, with a
stipe that can reach up to 25 cm in length
and supports a spore sac. The exoperidium persists as a
volva at the base and as apical scales on the
endoperidium. The endoperidium and spore sac are hemispherical to conical,
with diameters ranging from 2.8 cm to 7.2 cm, and
subsequently split circularly along the middle before deteriorating. The volva
is membranous, up to 15 cm in diameter, and exhibits
a color and surface texture similar to that of the
stipe, to which it is partially attached at the base
(Rea 1942; Garrido-Benavent 2014; Campi et al. 2016b).
