A key characteristic of the database is its exclusive focus
on new residences, thereby eliminating the need to account for
property depreciation. For monetary standardization, all prices were adjusted using
the IGP-DI index and updated to December 2013 values. The
database is geocoded based on ZIP code, street, and number
information, utilizing the SIRGAS 2000 geographic coordinate system with a
UTM Zone 23S projection, which is also applied to all
associated maps.
