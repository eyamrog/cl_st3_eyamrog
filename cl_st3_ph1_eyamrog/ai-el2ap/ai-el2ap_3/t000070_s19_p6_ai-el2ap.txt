In the micrographs of V. reitzii seeds, the presence of
the embryo and plumose appendages at the time of conservation
is evident (Figure 1a). In the region containing the embryo,
a reaction of acidic compounds to toluidine blue O (TBO)
staining was observed, specifically in the procambium, which is composed
of the nuclei of embryonic cells and exhibited a dark
purple coloration (Figure 1b, indicated by the arrow).
