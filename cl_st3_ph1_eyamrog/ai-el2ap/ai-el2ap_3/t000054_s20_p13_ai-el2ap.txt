Although the medical significance of these discoveries is relatively recent,
ayahuasca attracted commercial interest much earlier. In 1986, Loren Miller,
a United States citizen and then director of the International
Plant Medicine Corporation (IPMC), was granted a plant patent by
the United States Patent and Trademark Office for a specimen
he named "Da Vine." This plant, which Miller had brought
from the Amazon rainforest in 1981, was, in fact, ayahuasca.
