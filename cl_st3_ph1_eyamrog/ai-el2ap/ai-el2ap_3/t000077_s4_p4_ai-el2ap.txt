The results of the empirical model indicate that a substantial
portion of the patterns identified in the descriptive analysis can
be attributed to differences in occupational and sectoral selection, as
evidenced by the considerable reduction in nearly all coefficients when
fixed effects for work type, position, or function were included.
The observed decrease in the public sector effect suggests that
the elevated rates of remote work participation among public sector
employees, as seen in the descriptive analysis, are primarily due
to compositional factors or the specific nature of tasks commonly
performed in the public sector.
