The fragmentation of forest formations, defined as isolated patches of
forest surrounded by areas subjected to anthropogenic transformation, can result
in negative edge effects and the isolation of species (Cosgrove
et al. 2018). Fragmentation may also alter seed dispersal patterns
within affected areas (Cordeiro & Howe 2003), thereby impacting the
maintenance of genetic diversity and gene flow (Wang & Smith
2002). Forest formations such as riparian forests along watercourses are
important for maintaining gene flow, as they facilitate the interconnection
of populations fragmented by habitat disturbance (Kageyama & Gandara 2001).
Additionally, riparian forests contribute to the stabilization of watercourse margins,
function as natural filters for nutrients and agrochemicals, intercept and
absorb solar radiation, and provide shelter and food resources for
both aquatic and terrestrial fauna (Sabino & Castro 1990).
