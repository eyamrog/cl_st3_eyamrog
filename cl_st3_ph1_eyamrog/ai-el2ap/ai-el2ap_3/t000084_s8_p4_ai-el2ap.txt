Since its introduction to the market in 2009, WhatsApp has
experienced sustained growth in popularity. While the application was initially
used primarily for communication purposes, it has since demonstrated potential
as a tool for mediating educational experiences. Its ubiquity and
mobility, along with features that facilitate the creation and sharing
of oral, written, and multimedia content, as well as the
ability to reply to and forward messages, have attracted the
attention of educators, particularly in language education, who are increasingly
integrating WhatsApp into teaching and learning practices.
