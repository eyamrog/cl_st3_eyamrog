Khamis et al. (2021) employed high-frequency phone surveys to evaluate
the initial effects of Covid-19 on labor markets in several
developing countries. Their findings indicate that 34% of respondents reported
ceasing work, with regional variation observed: 21% in East Asia
and the Pacific, 29% in Europe and Central Asia, 48%
in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), 45% in the
Middle East and North Africa, and 26% in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Within the LAC region, the proportion of respondents who stopped
working was 30% in Chile, 36% in Costa Rica, 59%
in Peru, and 69% in Bolivia. The study also found
that the likelihood of work cessation was higher among workers
in the services (38%) and industry (40%) sectors compared to
those in agriculture (22%).
