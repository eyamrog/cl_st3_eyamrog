The primary objective of this paper was to present the
rationale for constructing an academic learner corpus, emphasizing its importance
in identifying features of learners' written interlanguage. The paper detailed
the main principles of corpus compilation, specifically those related to
the design criteria implemented for CorIFA. Subsequently, the methodological procedures
employed during the compilation process were described. Additionally, the characteristics
of the texts included in the corpus and the registers
corresponding to studentsâ€™ proficiency levels were explained, thereby highlighting the
potential for a wide range of future research topics.
