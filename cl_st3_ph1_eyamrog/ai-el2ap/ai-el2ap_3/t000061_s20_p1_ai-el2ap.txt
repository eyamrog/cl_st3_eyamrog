Of the 26 respondents, 46.2% (n=12) began their activities in
the USR before the age of 20, 34.6% (n=9) between
the ages of 21 and 24, 15.4% (n=4) between 25
and 30 years old, and 3.8% (n=1) at over 30
years old. These data indicate that 80.8% (n=21) of respondents
started their involvement with the USR before the age of
24, which aligns with one of the primary objectives of
the USR: to encourage the early engagement of young individuals
in research activities, as recommended by CNPq in Normative Resolution
No. 017 (Brazil, 2006).
