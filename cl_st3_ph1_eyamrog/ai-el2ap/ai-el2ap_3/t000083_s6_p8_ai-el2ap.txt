Among individuals exhibiting severe levels of selfitis, the highest scores
were observed in the "attention seeking" and "social competition" factors.
The "social competition" factor, which has been linked to various
behaviors such as compulsive gambling and substance use (Balakrishnan &
Griffiths, 2017), had the second highest mean score (3.45) among
the five factors assessed in the present study, indicating a
strong association with severe selfitis behavior. At this severity level,
behaviors such as sharing selfies in various poses, anticipating "likes"
and comments, and utilizing image editing tools appear to be
particularly prominent. The "attention seeking" factor recorded the highest mean
score (4.02), suggesting that individuals with severe selfitis are highly
motivated by the desire for attention on social networks, including
seeking "likes," positive feedback, increased popularity, and investing significant time
in editing images for sharing. Positive feedback on posts may
reinforce self-confidence and fulfill personal expectations (Boursier & Manna, 2018).
Additionally, attention seeking has been identified as a potential narcissistic
component (Khan & Imran, 2019; McCain et al., 2016), and
there is evidence of a positive relationship between self-promoting selfies
on social media and narcissism levels (Gnambs, 2017). Overall, the
"attention seeking" factor is strongly associated with severe selfitis, consistent
with findings from previous studies (Balakrishnan & Griffiths, 2017; Seidman,
2013). Furthermore, Haggard (2014) suggests that individuals may prioritize displaying
their experiences over engaging with them directly, reflecting a persistent
pursuit of attention.
