Schegloff (2001, p. 230) characterizes conversational interaction as a form
of social organization through which the functions of key societal
institutions—such as the economy, the polity, the family, and socialization—are
accomplished, and identifies it as the fundamental environment for the
development, use, and acquisition of natural language. In line with
this perspective, the present study applies conversation analysis to interactions
in forensic contexts, focusing on the linguistic resources that speakers
utilize to achieve specific communicative objectives. This research adopts a
textual-interactive approach to spoken language, integrating concepts from both conversation
analysis and forensic linguistics. The primary aim is to examine
how formulations, politeness strategies, and facework are employed by speakers
in courtroom interactions to accomplish particular goals. The analysis includes
elements such as adjacency pairs (e.g., question/answer), so-prefaced questions, discourse
markers, paraphrases, face-threatening acts, mitigation devices, verbal planning markers, formulations
introduced by discourse markers, tag questions, and the three central
properties of formulations: preservation, transformation, and deletion.
