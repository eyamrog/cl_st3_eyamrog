Binici et al. (2010) conducted a study to assess the
effectiveness of capital controls and other regulatory measures in managing
the volume of financial flows. The authors analyzed data from
74 countries over the period 1995â€“2005, focusing on the impact
of capital flow management measures (CFMs) on three categories of
financial instruments: equity, foreign direct investment (FDI), and debt. The
regression results indicate that, among high-income countries in the sample,
CFMs targeting outflows were effective in reducing the gross volume
of financial instruments, with the strongest effect observed in the
debt category. Furthermore, the effectiveness of outflow-oriented CFMs in high-income
countries was found to be greater than that of similar
measures implemented by middle- and low-income countries.
