The responses consistently demonstrate a focus on the material aspects
of the USR experience, aligning with Benjaminâ€™s (1985) concept of
mental image formation, which suggests that individuals tend to interpret
the world primarily through images. Respondents frequently employed sensory verbs
such as "seeing" and "looking," as well as terms that
concretize abstract concepts, such as "distancing." These linguistic choices indicate
that mimetic learning is perceived as an embodied process, engaging
both sensory perception and cognitive reasoning.
