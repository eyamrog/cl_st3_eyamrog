With respect to the monitoring of information flow, this study
adopts Chafe’s (1982, p. 47) definition of involvement, which encompasses
the speaker’s monitoring of the communication channel with the listener
and efforts to ensure its effective functioning. Speakers may utilize
specific strategies to reinforce their message by directing the listener’s
attention to particular aspects of the ongoing discourse. Discourse markers
such as well, you know, and I mean, among others,
are commonly employed to fulfill this function.
