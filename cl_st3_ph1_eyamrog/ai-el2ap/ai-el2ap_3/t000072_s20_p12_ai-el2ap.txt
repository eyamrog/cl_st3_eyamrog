Among the ecological groups identified, 37.5% of the species were
classified as non-pioneers and 30% as pioneers. The remaining species
were not assigned to an ecological group due to their
classification as herbaceous (22.5%), lianas (7.5%), or undetermined (2.5%). Although
non-pioneer species exhibited the highest species diversity, the majority of
recorded individuals (83.6%) belonged to the pioneer group. Previous studies
have reported that most species present in the seed bank
of semideciduous forests are pioneers in terms of ecological succession
(Thompson 2000; Braga et al. 2016; Kunz & Martins 2016),
as these species are capable of persisting in the soil
for extended periods in a dormant state and typically produce
large quantities of seeds (Martins et al. 2015). In contrast,
non-pioneer species generally do not establish populations within the seed
bank, as their larger seeds are less able to penetrate
the litter layer and integrate with the soil (Martins et
al. 2015). The inability of large seeds to become incorporated
into the soil increases their exposure to predation (Silva et
al. 2019), whereas the smaller seeds of pioneer species are
more readily buried and thus often experience greater protection from
predators (Thompson 2000). In a study by Nóbrega et al.
(2009) conducted in the riparian forest of the Mogi Guaçu
River, 47% of the species emerging from the seed bank
were pioneers, which contrasts with the present study, where pioneers
accounted for 30% of the emerged species. Other studies conducted
in similar phytophysiognomies have also found that the majority of
emerged species are characterized as pioneers (Franco et al. 2012).
