The first published study on sand fly fauna in the
state capital, Rio Branco, was conducted by Martins and Silva
(1964) [7], who recorded 30 species, with Pintomyia nevesi (Damasceno
& Arouck, 1956) identified as the dominant species. In the
early 1980s, Arias and Freitas [8] conducted research in the
municipalities of Cruzeiro do Sul, Feijó, and Rio Branco, identifying
50 species, with Trichophoromyia auraensis (Mangabeira, 1942) as the most
frequent. In the late 2000s, Azevedo et al. [9] reported
a predominance of Nyssomyia whitmani (Antunes & Coutinho, 1939), Ny.
antunesi (Coutinho, 1939), and Th. auraensis in the municipalities of
Rio Branco, Bujari, and Xapuri. Concurrently, Silva-Nunes et al. [10]
found Ny. whitmani and Ny. antunesi to be predominant in
rural areas of Acrelândia. Similar patterns have been observed in
peri-urban and forested areas of Rio Branco [6, 11]. In
Assis Brasil, 67 species were collected, including three new records
for Acre: Evandromyia georgii (Freitas & Barret, 2002), Lutzomyia evangelistai
Martins & Fraiha, 1971, and Psychodopygus complexus (Mangabeira, 1941). The
most abundant species in this locality were Trichophoromyia spp. (Th.
auraensis / Th. ruifreitasi) and Ps. davisi (Root, 1934), both
of which were detected with Leishmania braziliensis Vianna, 1911 and
L. guyanensis Floch, 1954 using molecular techniques [12]. Additionally, two
species, Lutzomyia naiffi Teles et al., 2013 and Th. ruifreitasi
Oliveira et al., 2015, were described from this locality, with
the female of Th. ruifreitasi being morphologically indistinguishable from several
other species within the genus Trichophoromyia. Recent studies have also
reported new records of sand fly species in Assis Brasil
[13, 14, 15].
