In this research strand, Klein’s (2012) study is particularly relevant.
The author clearly differentiates between countries that implemented capital controls
as a temporary measure and those that maintained them on
a permanent basis. The former group primarily comprised Latin American
and some developed countries, while the latter mainly included Asian
economies. Using panel regressions, the study analyzes differences in economic
performance, financial vulnerability, and exchange rate behavior associated with these
distinct approaches to capital controls. The initial estimation for the
period 1995–2010 indicates that countries with permanent capital controls experienced
higher rates of economic growth and lower rates of growth
in financial variables compared to those with only temporary controls.
