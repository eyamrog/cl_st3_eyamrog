Mutualistic interactions can promote trait matching, defined as the similarity
of traits between interacting species. While mutualisms may also lead
to other trait patterns, such as trait intensification (Anderson &
Johnson 2008), trait matching has been documented in various mutualistic
systems, including pollination by flies and bees (Zhang et al.
2012; Santamaria & Rodríguez-Gironés 2007), seed dispersal by birds and
bats (Galetti et al. 2013; Mello et al. 2011), and
Müllerian mimicry rings in velvet ants (Wilson et al. 2012).
Therefore, trait matching is considered a likely outcome of reciprocal
selection, potentially enhancing interaction efficiency in mutualisms (Thompson 1994; Zhang
et al. 2012). In contrast, antagonistic interactions, such as those
between parasites and hosts, tend to favor trait mismatching, which
can result in coevolutionary dynamics such as alternation and escalation,
thereby maintaining or increasing trait variation both within and among
species (Andreazzi et al. 2017).
