At first glance, it may appear that he is attempting
to summarize the events to verify his understanding (“So... after
two o’CLOCK... that... you... took everything and put it down
in the car correct?”). However, by explicitly requesting confirmation of
the information and employing the interactional discourse marker "correct," he
prompts her to make a decision to confirm his interpretation.
The use of "correct" functions similarly to a tag question,
indicating that the utterance is not solely an attempt to
comprehend her account but also serves to seek discursive approval
within an argumentative and interactional context. This approach suggests that
the lawyer is presenting information based on his own interpretation
rather than merely seeking confirmation, as this strategy enables him
to establish a foundation for subsequent questioning. By combining "so"
and "correct" in the same question, he attempts to elicit
agreement that his version of events is accurate, thereby encouraging
the audience to accept his interpretation as valid. Furthermore, as
previously noted, the use of a "so"-prefaced question plays a
significant role in evaluative summary and can effectively challenge and
reshape the interviewee’s account, potentially compelling them to reformulate their
response in a manner that is more evidentially substantial (Holt
and Johnson, 2010, p. 26). Holt and Johnson (2010, p.
