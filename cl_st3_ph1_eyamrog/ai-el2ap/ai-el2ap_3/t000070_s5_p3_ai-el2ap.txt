The significance of water content has been documented in several
studies involving a range of plant materials, including seeds of
Punica granatum L. (Punicaceae) (Silva et al. 2015), seeds of
Encholirium spectabile Martius ex Schultes f. (Bromeliaceae) (Ferrari et al.
2016), seeds of Pyrostegia venusta (Ker Gawl.) Miers (Salom√£o et
al. 2020), as well as seeds, pollen, protocorms, protocorm-like structures,
apices from in vitro plants, and meristematic tissues of orchids
(Popova et al. 2016).
