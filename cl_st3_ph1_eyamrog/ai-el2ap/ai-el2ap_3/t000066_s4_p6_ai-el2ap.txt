According to Freire (1970), the concept of the "viable unheard
of" can be identified in various active community movements, such
as the GPB, as well as in other initiatives that
adapt these principles to address local needs, exemplified by programs
like Brincadas and the manner in which the LACE Research
Group has reinterpreted GPBâ€™s principles within the Brazilian context. This
observation also highlights the multidisciplinary nature of Applied Linguistics (AL),
which has served as the theoretical and methodological foundation for
LACE over the years. For this group, it is essential
to integrate language research with social engagement, both as an
integral component of ongoing learning processes and as a means
of fostering individual and collective transformation through critical and responsive
action.
