Over several years of research on culicid fauna in the
state of Paraná, Dr. Ana Leuch Lozovei and her research
group published multiple studies [2,3,17,34,50–52] that emphasized the significance of
culicids in disease transmission and their role as indicators of
environmental quality. The present study was made possible through the
use of data generated by these previous investigations.
