In this study, we employ a quantitative trait-based mathematical model,
empirical species interaction networks, and numerical simulations to examine the
effects of cheater interactions on coevolution within mutualistic networks. We
address three primary research questions: (i) How do varying frequencies
of cheating interactions influence coevolutionary dynamics? Given that cheater-driven coevolution
tends to promote arms race dynamics, we hypothesize that higher
frequencies of cheating interactions will result in greater trait mismatches
among interacting species. (ii) Do central cheater species intensify the
impact of cheating interactions on trait evolution? Since central species
can affect the trait evolution of multiple other species, we
predict that central cheater species will amplify the influence of
cheating interactions on trait evolution within mutualistic networks. (iii) How
do cheating interactions affect the structural properties of mutualistic networks?
Assuming that cheating interactions promote arms race dynamics, we anticipate
increased trait matching among species engaged in arms races, but
greater trait mismatches with other partners, potentially leading to the
loss of interactions. Consequently, we expect that higher frequencies of
cheating interactions will result in more pronounced arms race dynamics,
a higher frequency of interaction loss, and increased network modularity
(Figure 1b).
