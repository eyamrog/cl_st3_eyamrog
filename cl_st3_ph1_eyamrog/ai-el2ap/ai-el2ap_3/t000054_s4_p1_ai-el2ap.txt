Latin America contains a significant proportion of the Earth's biodiversity,
which is partly attributable to the presence of relatively unexplored
regions and uncontacted Indigenous communities. The traditional practices of these
Indigenous groups, which emphasize respect for nature and coexistence with
the environment, contribute to the maintenance and preservation of biodiversity
and are closely integrated with a variety of cultural practices.
