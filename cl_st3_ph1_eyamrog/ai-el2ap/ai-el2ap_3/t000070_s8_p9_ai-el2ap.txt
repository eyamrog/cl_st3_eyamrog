In this context, V. reitzii seeds represent a suitable resource
for germplasm conservation due to their high genetic diversity and
the availability of established protocols for large-scale propagation. Therefore, the
objective of this study was to assess the viability, cellular
integrity, and polysaccharide content of both cryopreserved and non-cryopreserved V.
reitzii seeds through anatomical, biochemical, and ultrastructural analyses.
