McDonald (1987) initially proposed the cut-off method for identifying employment
sub-centers in the Chicago metropolitan area, and Giuliano and Small
(1991) subsequently extended this empirical approach by identifying 32 sub-centers
in Los Angeles, United States. According to their method, a
sub-center is defined as a group of contiguous areas with
a minimum employment density of ten employees per acre and
a total of at least 10,000 employees. These models have
been subject to several criticisms, including the discretionary selection of
locations, the sensitivity of results to the chosen cut-off values,
and the lack of generalizability to other cities (Anas et
al., 1998; McMillen, 2001b; Baumont et al., 2004).
