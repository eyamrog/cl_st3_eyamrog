An essential aspect of establishing social presence in face-to-face interactions
is the use of visual cues expressed by individuals. In
online environments, where participants often have not interacted in person,
the absence of such cues can hinder the development of
social presence. Kuehn (1993) and Walther (1994) identified strategies by
which participants foster connection in computer-mediated communication, such as the
use of emoticons and other symbols to convey affective elements.
These resources have been shown to facilitate the establishment of
social presence and enhance the quality of online interactions (Bai,
Dan, Mu, & Yang, 2019).
