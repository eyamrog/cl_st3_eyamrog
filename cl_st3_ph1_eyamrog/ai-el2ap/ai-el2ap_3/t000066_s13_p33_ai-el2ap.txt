The capacity for human action is rooted in interpersonal encounters,
as it is associated with the diverse possibilities for interaction
among affectus, defined as the potential to affect and be
affected. According to Sawaia (2009), affectus facilitates the integration of
individual capacities, resulting in the formation of a unified body
and mind. This consolidation of capacities gives rise to the
collective political subject and the multitude, which emerge from individualsâ€™
shared desire to achieve improved living conditions and pursue common
objectives that enhance the collective social benefit (Spinoza, 2017).
