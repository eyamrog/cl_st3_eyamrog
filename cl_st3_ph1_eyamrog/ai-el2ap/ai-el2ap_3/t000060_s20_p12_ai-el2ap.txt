This device weakens her account due to the inconsistent manner
in which she describes the timing of events. She initially
states that it was after two o’clock when she was
placing the luggage in the car, but when Martinez asks
for clarification—“And it was surely after two you... did what
you were doing?”—her response lacks specificity. Her hesitation is evident
through the use of verbal planning markers such as "uh"
and "well," as well as pauses and discourse markers indicating
uncertainty, including "maybe," "maybe not," "I guess," and "I don’t
know." Additionally, the prosecutor’s question is itself ambiguous; the phrase
“did what you were doing” could refer either to having
sex or to putting the luggage in the car. When
questions are imprecise, responses are also likely to be unclear,
which can result in confusion among listeners due to the
overall lack of clarity in the exchange.
