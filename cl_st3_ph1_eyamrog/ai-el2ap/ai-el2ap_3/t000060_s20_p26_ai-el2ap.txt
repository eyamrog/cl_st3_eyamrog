Regarding the use of "I think" and "I don’t think"
in Excerpt 5, it should be noted that these expressions
serve the same functions as observed in Excerpt 4. Specifically,
they act as mitigation devices, allowing the speaker to reduce
their responsibility for the statements made. The primary function of
such markers is to mitigate and protect the speaker’s face,
as they subtly convey opinions that are semantically loaded with
ideological values and reflect differing interactional goals. Markers such as
"I think (that)", "I believe (that)", "I know", and "it
seems to me" not only present an opinion but also
serve a mitigating function by acknowledging the interlocutor’s presence and
lessening the speaker’s accountability for the stated opinion. For example,
when the Judge states, “so the question frames her answers,
I think that it’s appropriate,” she provides justification for sustaining
the objection. Given that the question is specific—“what do you
do” rather than “who was there”—the defendant is required to
respond directly, or else the response may be subject to
objection. Although the interrogative pronoun "what" in the question clearly
restricts the range of acceptable answers, the Judge employs the
opinion marker "I think" to assert that the objection is
appropriate. This strategy serves to soften her responsibility for the
statement and simultaneously helps to maintain her positive face, as
her approach may be perceived by listeners as a fair
judgment.
