It is important to note the use of so-prefaced questions
and the markers "correct" and "right" functioning as tag questions
in some of the prosecutor’s formulations. So-prefaced questions were effective
in challenging and reframing the defendant’s account by exerting pressure
on her to modify her statements in a manner more
favorable to the prosecution. With respect to the discourse markers
and tag questions mentioned above, a degree of coerciveness was
observed in the cross-examining lawyer’s questioning. These types of questions
are more coercive because they restrict the range of possible
responses and, pragmatically, they presuppose that the respondent recognizes the
questioner’s position as correct.
