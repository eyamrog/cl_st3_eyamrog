Play (Vygotsky, 2001; Holzman, 2009), a key concept in this
discussion, involves situations in which participants engage with rules, navigate
uncertainty in an online context, and exercise a degree of
agency in response to conflicts that arise during sessions. This
paper examines and illustrates how participants encountered these principles, both
as they were incorporated into the workshop design and as
they were later described by participants during specific moments in
the session. By relating these concepts to selected participant testimonials,
the analysis suggests that play functions as an effective intervention
tool, supporting what Freire (1970) described as the creation of
the "viable unheard of," or the capacity to transform reality.
