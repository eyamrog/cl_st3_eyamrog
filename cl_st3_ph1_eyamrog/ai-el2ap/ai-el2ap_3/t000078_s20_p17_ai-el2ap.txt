Our results are consistent with those observed at the municipal
level. Previous studies conducted in the metropolitan area of São
Paulo have reported similar findings, despite employing different methodological approaches,
polygon sizes, and data sources. Siqueira (2014) identified seven subcenters
of business districts (SBD) in the São Paulo Metropolitan Area
(SPMA), three of which are located within the municipality of
São Paulo, specifically in the historic center, the Paulista Avenue–Faria
Lima Avenue corridor, and Santo Amaro. Campos (2018) identified three
SBD in the SPMA, but only one within the municipality
of São Paulo, encompassing all seven SBD identified in the
present study. Both Siqueira (2014) and Campos (2018) utilized identification
strategies based on the relative concentration of employment, which may
explain why they identified fewer SBD compared to this study.
Accordingly, their findings can be characterized as global SBD (relative
to the SPMA), whereas the present study identifies local SBD
(relative to the municipality of São Paulo).
