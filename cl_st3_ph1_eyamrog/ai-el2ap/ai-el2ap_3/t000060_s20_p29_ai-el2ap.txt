In Excerpt 7, the initial version of Ms. Willmott’s question
is “And this is when?”, which refers to the timing
of Alexander sending a photograph of his genitalia to Arias.
In the revised version, “When is it that he sent
-- approximately when is it that he sent you a
picture of his genitalia?”, part of the original meaning is
retained, but the question is reformulated to clarify and specify
the inquiry. Specifically, Ms. Willmott maintains the use of the
word “when” from the first version, incorporates additional information, and
frames the question in a more precise and objective manner.
The primary aim is to determine the time at which
Mr. Alexander sent the photograph to Arias; however, following an
objection from Mr. Martinez, Ms. Willmott rephrases her question to
enhance its clarity and accuracy. Notably, the inclusion of the
term “approximately” serves to allow for an imprecise response, thereby
reducing the likelihood of further objections and accommodating the possibility
that Arias may not recall the exact date.
