Although two-part adjacency pairs are prevalent in conversation, this framework
does not account for all types of spoken interaction. For
example, classroom discourse, interrogations, service encounters, and various other forms
of everyday communication often involve exchanges that include a third
move. These conversational routines provide participants with the opportunity to
confirm mutual understanding of the preceding pair's function, to comment
on the ongoing exchange, or to respond to the reply
within the context of the initial utterance (Sinclair, 1992, p.
85).
