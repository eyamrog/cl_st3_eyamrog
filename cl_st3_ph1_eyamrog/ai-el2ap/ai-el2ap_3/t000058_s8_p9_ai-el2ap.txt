These mosquitoes constitute a significant component in the transmission cycles
of numerous neglected, emerging, and re-emerging diseases [22–24]. The collection
includes samples from a wide range of medically important species
(Table 1), such as Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse, 1895) and
Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (Linnaeus, 1762), which are recognized as the
primary vectors of Dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Aedes aegypti also plays a major role
in the urban transmission of Yellow Fever virus (YFV) [25,26].
Other species, including Haemagogus (Conopostegus) leucocelaenus (Dyar & Shannon, 1924)
and Aedes (Ochlerotatus) fulvus (Wiedemann, 1828), both members of the
Aedini tribe, are associated with yellow fever transmission in forested
environments [27,28]. Recent laboratory studies by Lourenço-de-Oliveira and Failoux [29]
have demonstrated the vector competence of Hg. leucocelaenus and Aedes
(Protomacleaya) terrens (Walker, 1856) for Chikungunya virus, indicating that both
species are capable of transmitting this pathogen. Additionally, the genus
Culex is a key vector group for the transmission of
Wuchereria bancrofti (the causative agent of lymphatic filariasis), various forms
of encephalitis, and severe hemorrhagic fevers such as Oropouche fever
[30–32]. The genus Anopheles is primarily responsible for the transmission
of Plasmodium spp., the etiological agents of human malaria [33–36].
Beyond their public health significance, culicids also play a crucial
role in the transmission of pathogens relevant to veterinary medicine,
including those responsible for Equine Infectious Anaemia (EIA), dirofilariasis, and
West Nile fever [37–41], some of which possess zoonotic potential.
These factors underscore the central role of culicids in the
epidemiology of vector-borne diseases [21,42,43].
