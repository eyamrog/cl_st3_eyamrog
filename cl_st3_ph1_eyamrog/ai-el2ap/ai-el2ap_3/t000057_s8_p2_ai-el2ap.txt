Similar to other riparian forests, these ecosystems are expected to
perform important buffer functions, including the retention of sediment, nutrients,
and anthropogenic chemicals such as pesticides. This expectation is based
on the assumption that riparian soils in these forests exhibit
high topsoil permeability, which reduces or eliminates surface runoff from
adjacent upland areas (Salemi et al. 2011). However, there is
currently no documented information on the basic topsoil permeability of
these riparian forests. Assessing these soil properties within specific physical
contexts may provide insights into whether these ecosystems fulfill their
anticipated buffer functions. Furthermore, such data can serve as a
baseline to support scientists and land managers in predicting the
effects of inappropriate riparian land use and in planning effective
restoration strategies (see Brito et al. 2019; Pereira et al.
2021).
