The “Coleção de Flebotomíneos” (FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB) at Fiocruz Minas is a
curated biological collection comprising approximately 80,000 individual specimens representing 370
species of sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae, Phlebotominae), primarily from the
Americas, collected over the past 80 years by entomologists studying
and seeking to control leishmaniases. Since 2010, metadata for each
specimen in FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB, including retrospective data for specimens deposited in
previous decades, has been digitized. The resulting electronic catalogue, which
includes records for 72,624 specimens along with all available provenance
information, is now published online via the speciesLink network (<http://www.splink.org.br/search?collectioncode=FIOCRUZ-COLFLEB&group=animais&lang=pt&action=openform>)
and the Sistema de Informação sobre a Biodiversidade Brasileira (SiBBr)
(<http://ipt.fiocruz.br/ipt/resource?r=fiocruz_colfleb>).
