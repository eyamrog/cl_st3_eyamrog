The responses support the interpretation that the aesthetic dimension of
the USR experience, as a form of training that facilitates
mimetic learning, enhances the comprehension of abstract concepts, including those
related to the foundations of moral behavior. The tension between
theoretical knowledge and practical application in USR, particularly in the
moral domain, is demonstrated by the substantial proportion of respondents—73.1%
(n=19)—who reported having encountered an ethical dilemma during their research,
in contrast to 80.5% (n=21) who indicated insufficient familiarity with
Resolution NHC No. 510 (Brasil, 2016). These findings suggest that
students are capable of identifying ethical dilemmas even when their
knowledge of relevant regulations is limited.
