Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted to examine the
relationship between multiple response variables and the construct under investigation,
followed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess mean differences
among individual factors across varying levels of selfie intensity (categorized
as low, mild, moderate, and severe). The average variance extracted
(AVE) was calculated as an indicator of the structural model
quality for the psychometric instrument, in accordance with established guidelines
(Hair et al., 2009; Fornell & Larcker, 1981). AVE calculations
were based on parameter estimates obtained through Structural Equation Modeling
(SEM). AVE is defined as the squared factor loading and,
within the SEM framework, both measurement error and squared factor
loadings are expressed in the same units, allowing AVE to
represent the average proportion of item variance explained by the
latent variable. Fornell and Larcker (1981) recommend an AVE value
of 0.50 or higher as indicative of adequate model fit.
Convergent validity can be assessed using both AVE and Cronbach's
alpha, as supported by previous research (Fornell & Larcker, 1981;
Pestana & Gageiro, 2005; Hair et al., 2009). The application
of AVE for evaluating convergent validity has become increasingly prevalent
in recent empirical studies (Fock et al., 2013; Niclasen et
al., 2013; Obasi et al., 2014). For the analysis of
variance of the factors identified in the Selfitis Behavior Scale
(SBS), four levels of selfitis were defined: scores of 20–40
indicate low selfitis behavior, 41–60 indicate mild selfitis behavior, 61–80
indicate moderate selfitis behavior, and 81–100 indicate severe selfitis behavior.
