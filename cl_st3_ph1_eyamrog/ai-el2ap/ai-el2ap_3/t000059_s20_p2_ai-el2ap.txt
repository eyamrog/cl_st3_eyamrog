The median number of signed articles per journal was 166
(Table 1). In comparison, MEDLINE journals analyzed by Scanff et
al. (2021) had a median of 500 signed articles, with
an interquartile range of 262 to 964. After statistical reweighting,
the size distribution of MEDLINE journals was equivalent to that
of journals indexed in LILACS (1).
