Cabells’ method of identifying “violations” for each listed title represents
an improvement over Beall’s approach, which involved simply adding publishers
and journals to a list without further specification. However, Cabells
continues to rely on relatively weak proxies that may not
accurately indicate a lack of experience or professional support. Additionally,
the increased level of detail comes at the cost of
transparency, as the identities of the journals and the specific
“violations” are generally not disclosed to those listed. This lack
of transparency is problematic, given that Cabells’ identification of violations
could provide valuable guidance for journal improvement. We have recommended
to Cabells that, in the interest of fairness, it should
share its assessments with journals designated as a “probable threat.”
Although Cabells is not currently willing to implement this recommendation,
we intend to inform the company of the outcomes of
our initiative, which involves contacting publishers of journals included in
Predatory Reports to offer advice on addressing the cited “violations”
and to encourage them to seek reconsideration. This strategy may
provide Cabells with further justification to reconsider its practices and
could also enhance the accuracy of its predatory reports by
reducing the incidence of false positives.
