Additionally, leaves from in vitro-grown V. squamata exhibited several structural
differences compared to those from acclimatized plants. Specifically, in vitro
leaves lacked subepidermal fibres, displayed a less pronounced dorsiventral mesophyll,
had undifferentiated bundle sheath extensions, contained fewer vascular system fibres,
and did not possess aquiferous parenchyma. In contrast, aquiferous tissue
is retained in the leaves of in vitro-grown pineapple (Ananas
comosus L.) (Barboza et al. 2006). Therefore, the qualitative alterations
observed in V. squamata, particularly the absence of stomatal crypts
and subepidermal fibres, are uncommon.
