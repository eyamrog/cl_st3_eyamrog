To advance the public value of open access and support
the global growth of scholarly publishing, PKP is developing new
tools to assess and communicate the trustworthiness of scholarly outputs.
This initiative will require journals to engage with third-party trade
organizations to verify and register the roles and responsibilities of
individuals involved in the publishing process; for example, ORCiD, an
organization specializing in researcher identity and profile management, is discussed
below. The initial focus is on implementing five fundamental scholarly
standards, with the potential to expand to more detailed and
specialized standards, such as those relevant to clinical trials (see
Table 5). These systems will rely on the exchange of
information between journals and external organizations, enabling a level of
transparency and scrutiny that is currently unattainable, such as providing
insight into the backgrounds of journal reviewers or the typical
number of reviews per manuscript. Although the process will incorporate
automated connections and controls, all outcomes will remain subject to
human review and potential challenge. By releasing the connecting technologies
under open source licenses, these advancements will also be accessible
to commercial and other publishing platforms.
