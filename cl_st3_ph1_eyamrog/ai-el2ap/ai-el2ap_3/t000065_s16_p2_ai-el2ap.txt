Data collection was initially modeled after the International Corpus of
Learner English (ICLE). CorIFA and ICLE share similarities in task
variables, including task medium, genre, topic, and task setting. The
compilation of CorIFA began with written tasks, specifically argumentative essays,
similar to those found in ICLE. Students were instructed to
write essays on predetermined topics such as the internet, feminism,
and science and technology. These essays were written either in
class or at home and submitted via email. In terms
of essay length, a notable difference exists between the two
corpora: ICLE required essays to be between 500 and 1000
words, whereas CorIFA initially accepted essays ranging from 200 to
300 words. Regarding learner variables, both ICLE and CorIFA include
participants who are university students learning English in a non-English-speaking
country, and their age ranges and learning contexts are comparable.
However, the two corpora differ primarily in first language, academic
level, discipline, and language proficiency. At this stage, only first
language will be addressed, as the other variables will be
discussed in the following section. ICLE comprises subcorpora containing English
texts from speakers of various first languages (e.g., Chinese, Turkish,
Portuguese, French), while CorIFA participants are predominantly Portuguese speakers. Initially,
consent forms were collected in printed format and included basic
student information such as name and enrollment number. As the
research group later revised the consent forms to gather additional
metadata, texts collected in 2013 were excluded from the corpus.
