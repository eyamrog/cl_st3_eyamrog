Two additional CorIFA CIA studies focused on verb usage. Guedes
(2017) examined the most frequent academic verbs in argumentative essays
from CorIFA, comparing their usage to that in the British
Academic Written English corpus (BAWE). Nunes and Orfanò (2020) analyzed
verbs in research abstracts, specifically within the system of transitivity
in passive that-clauses, and contrasted the learner corpus results with
those from a Lingua Franca Corpus composed of abstracts from
both soft and hard sciences. Guedes (2017) found that CorIFA
essays exhibited limited variation in action verbs and a low
frequency of adverb + verb collocations compared to BAWE, indicating
Brazilian learners’ limited familiarity with academic register. Regarding abstracts, Nunes
and Orfanò (2020) reported that learners tended to use more
mental verbs (e.g., conclude, verify, assume), whereas expert writers preferred
relational verbs (e.g., show, demonstrate, reveal). Additionally, learners often omitted
the conscious agent, resulting in a more detached stance toward
their findings, while expert researchers demonstrated greater engagement with their
object of study and displayed more intellectual authority. These findings
suggest that developing authorship is a skill that should be
addressed in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) instruction, and that
corpus-driven linguistic analyses of verb variation and collocations can provide
valuable insights for teaching practice.
