The ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) identifier was employed
to disambiguate authors whenever possible and was available for 7.2%
of the authorships, defined as the product of the number
of authors per article and the total number of articles.
Following minimal processing of author names, such as the removal
of extraneous elements, the ORCID identifier was substituted for the
author name when a given name was associated with a
single ORCID identifier. This procedure was repeated after author names
were normalized by removing diacritics (encoding names in ASCII) and
replacing hyphens with spaces, as Spanish-language authors sometimes use hyphens
to facilitate indexing by first family name. Ultimately, 148 unique
author names (0.5%) were associated with more than one ORCID
identifier and also appeared at times without an ORCID identifier.
Due to the ambiguity in assigning a specific ORCID identifier
in these cases, these authors, as well as those without
any ORCID identifier, were identified by their author name, following
the approach of Scanff et al. (2021).
