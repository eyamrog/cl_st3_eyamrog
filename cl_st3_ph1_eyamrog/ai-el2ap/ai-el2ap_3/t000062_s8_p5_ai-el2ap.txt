Although several studies have addressed the use of this species
and recent warnings have highlighted its ecological impacts, research specifically
focused on arthropods, and spiders in particular, remains limited. Spiders
represent a highly diverse taxonomic group with adaptations that enable
them to inhabit a wide range of environments (World Spider
Catalog 2021). They are classified into guilds based on habitat
preferences and foraging strategies (Uetz 1977; Cardoso et al. 2011),
are recognized as effective biological control agents of pest populations
(Aguilar 1988; Fl√≥rez 2000), and may interact indirectly with invasive
plants. Alterations in spider assemblages can consequently affect the broader
arthropod community structure (Mgobozi et al. 2008). According to Bultman
and DeWitt (2008), the invasive alien species Vinca minor L.
(Apocynaceae) has been shown to influence the mobility of native
spiders, resulting in reduced abundance.
