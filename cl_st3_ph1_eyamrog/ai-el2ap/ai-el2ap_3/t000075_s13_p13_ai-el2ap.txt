The shift toward stronger regulation of cross-border capital flows has
been supported by key economic forums, including the Committee on
International Economic Policy and Reform (CIEPR). In line with this
perspective, both CIEPR and Eichengreen (2011) emphasize the importance of
macroprudential regulation in addressing asset inflation and credit booms. They
also acknowledge that small, liberalized economies often have limited autonomy
in implementing domestic policies. Consequently, these economies are advised to
employ macroprudential measures and temporary capital controls, particularly on capital
inflows that finance domestic financial institutions, as the external equilibrium
of emerging economies cannot be assured solely through real exchange
rate adjustments.
