Invasive alien species are organisms that, after being introduced from
external environments, are able to adapt, reproduce, and proliferate extensively.
Their establishment can alter ecological processes and negatively impact native
species. Biological invasions are recognized as the second leading cause
of global biodiversity loss (Mack et al. 2000; Latini et
al. 2016). According to Pombo et al. (2016), such invasions
can modify soil ecological properties, nutrient cycling, water availability, trophic
interactions, and the structure and distribution of populations and communities.
In addition, invasive alien species can affect ecosystem functions by
altering biomass distribution and decomposition rates (Helsen et al. 2018).
They may also disrupt evolutionary processes, leading to local extinctions
and increased ecosystem homogenization (Herrera et al. 2016).
