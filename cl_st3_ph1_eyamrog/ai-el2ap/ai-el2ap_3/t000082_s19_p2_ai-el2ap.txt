Cheating interactions were found to influence the number of species
trait clusters in the networks. At low frequencies of cheating
interactions (p = 0.01, where p represents the proportion of
cheating interactions), simulations yielded a low mean number of clusters
(2.43±0.62; Fig. 2d-f). At intermediate frequencies (p = 0.5), the
mean number of trait clusters increased (3.03±0.79). However, when the
majority of interactions in the network were classified as cheating
(p = 0.9), the mean number of trait clusters decreased,
resembling the values observed at low frequencies of cheating interactions
(Fig. 2d-f). These results indicate that increasing the frequency of
cheating interactions initially promotes trait disparity by increasing the number
of trait clusters, but this effect is reversed at higher
frequencies, where trait clusters are reduced or disappear.
