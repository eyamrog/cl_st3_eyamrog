Among the families with the greatest species diversity is Urticaceae,
which is represented in Brazil by 14 genera and approximately
116 species (Gaglioti et al. 2020). Species within this family
are characterized by rapid growth rates, short life cycles, and
typically attain small to medium sizes (Parrota 1995). Most Urticaceae
species require exposure to sunlight for development (Godoi & Tanaki
2005), and consequently, they are commonly found in forest edge
environments and clearings within forest interiors, where light availability is
higher. In both primary and secondary tropical forest soils, seeds
from this family, particularly those of Cecropia spp., are frequently
abundant (Lobova et al. 2003).
