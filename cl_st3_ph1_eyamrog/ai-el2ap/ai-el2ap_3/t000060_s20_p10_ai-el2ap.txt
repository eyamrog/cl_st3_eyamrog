Martinez challenges Arias’s negative face by attempting to undermine the
credibility of her account regarding the timing of the events
and by highlighting the lack of precision in her statements.
Through formulations such as “the way you’re saying is... you’re
saying it could be... six o’clock in the evening and
you’re telling us it was... surely after after two o‘clock,”
he demonstrates that her responses lack specificity and are open
to multiple interpretations, such as the possibility of the events
occurring at six o’clock in the evening. Martinez further seeks
to expose inconsistencies in her testimony by referencing her own
statements and employing the discourse marker “right” (as in “based
on that statement, right?”) to prompt confirmation and emphasize the
perceived contradiction.
