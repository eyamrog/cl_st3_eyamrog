Politeness strategies serve as important mechanisms that speakers employ to
mitigate the illocutionary force of their utterances. These sociointeractional strategies
are linked to individualsâ€™ needs to obtain social approval and
to maintain their own autonomy. Notable examples of such strategies
include the use of metadiscursive expressions, evasive forms, paraphrases, and
markers that signal varying degrees of speaker involvement, among other
relevant linguistic features.
