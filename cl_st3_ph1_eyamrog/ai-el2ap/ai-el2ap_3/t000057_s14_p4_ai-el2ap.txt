The Mini-disk infiltrometer is a two-chamber device that utilizes the
Mariotte principle to regulate soil suction, employing the analytical solution
proposed by Zhang (1997). Following the methodology of Ghimire et
al. (2013), two procedures were implemented to enhance contact between
the infiltrometer and the soil: (i) the litter layer was
carefully removed, and (ii) a thin layer (<1 mm) of
fine sand was applied. These steps were taken to ensure
optimal contact between the device and the soil surface. To
assess the widest range of soil pores, a suction pressure
of 0 cm was applied, corresponding to Ko, or the
saturated hydraulic conductivity, as described by Reichardt and Timm (2019).
Water discharge rates through the Mini-disk infiltrometer were determined by
monitoring changes in water levels within the storage chamber until
steady-state flow was achieved. Infiltration measurements were conducted along three
linear transects that were randomly selected within the riparian forest
(see Figure 2) using randomizer software (randomizer.org), which selected 3
out of 50 possible grid transects. Ten infiltration samples were
collected from each transect, with transects established parallel to the
stream channel. To minimize the influence of soil moisture variability
on infiltration measurements, two additional steps were taken: (i) all
measurements were performed in August, during the dry season when
regional soil moisture is at its lowest (Oliveira et al.
2005), and (ii) a suction pressure of 0 cm was
maintained in the Mariotte bottle, as recommended by Pereira et
al. (2021).
