As a central principle in the GPB, play is intended
to facilitate social change across a wide range of contexts.
During workshops, participants share their everyday experiences and extend these
to a global perspective through creative activities and interpersonal connections
(Vygotsky, 2004). The process emphasizes hope, emotional support, and personal
development, as participants engage in play and dialogue to explore
possibilities beyond current crises. This approach within the GPB community
is designed to provide opportunities for critical reflection, imagination, and
the creation of alternative realities in response to dehumanization and
ecological decline.
