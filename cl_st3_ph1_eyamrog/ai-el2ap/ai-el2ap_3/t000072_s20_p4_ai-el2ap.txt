Solanaceae ranked third in species diversity in the present study.
The individuals identified are zoochoric, with seed dispersal primarily facilitated
by animals following ingestion (Ruschel et al. 2008). For example,
Solanum lycocarpum A.St-Hil. is mainly dispersed by the maned wolf
(Chrysocyon brachyurus Illiger, 1815), an endangered mammal species (Massara et
al. 2012; Brazil 2014). Müller (2016) reported the presence of
the maned wolf in the Guarnição da Aeronáutica de Pirassununga
area, suggesting that this species may act as a disperser
in the study region. Approximately 83% of all Solanaceae species
are dispersed by animals, which plays a significant role in
the structuring of forest communities (Albuquerque et al. 2006). These
species are also important in the colonization of open environments
such as clearings, pastures, and forest edges, as they are
classified as pioneer species and require direct sunlight for development
(Tabarelli et al. 1999).
