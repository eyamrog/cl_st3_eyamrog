Research ethics has emerged as a critical field due to
its association with significant ethical violations throughout history, particularly during
World War II. In recent years, there has been a
marked increase in the development and implementation of ethical norms
intended to safeguard the integrity of research, a trend that
is especially evident within educational institutions, where a formative approach
to research ethics would be expected. In response to historical
transgressions, a comprehensive regulatory framework was established, initially focused on
preventing the recurrence of unethical practices predominantly observed in the
biomedical sciences. However, this regulatory approach has subsequently been extended
to other research disciplines, often without sufficient consideration for the
specific characteristics and requirements of these diverse scientific fields (Israel
and Hay, 2006).
