In the present experiment, chlorophyll content was not measured directly;
however, comparative analysis indicated that greenhouse-grown, partially shaded plants exhibited
approximately twice the chlorophyll content (2.99 CCI) of in vitro
plantlets (1.37 CCI), but slightly less than half that of
plants grown in an open garden (8.70 CCI). All experimental
groups demonstrated substantially lower chlorophyll content compared to wild plants
(24.6 CCI). While the increase in photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)
from in vitro to garden conditions may account for some
of these differences, the reason for the garden-grown young plants
displaying only about one third of the chlorophyll content observed
in wild plants remains unclear. It is notable that the
anatomical structure of leaves from garden-grown plants was generally similar
to that of field-grown plants, with the exception of reduced
thickness. Thus, although growth under abundant sunlight produced anatomically mature
leaves, these leaves exhibited a comparatively immature photosynthetic profile.
