Several authors within the Keynesian and Structuralist traditions in economics
have highlighted the inherent instability of capital flows since the
foundational works of Keynes on this topic. Within this literature,
a specific strand emphasizes the capacity of a limited number
of currencies to denominate debt contracts and derivative instruments in
international markets, a phenomenon referred to as the ‘currency hierarchy’.
This hierarchy suggests that a significant portion of capital flows
to economies with inconvertible currencies is influenced by the liquidity
preferences of international investors (Prates, 2005; Prates & Cintra, 2008;
Conti et al., 2014; Fritz & Prates, 2014). Consequently, the
interest rates in these peripheral economies may be subject to
pressures arising from fluctuations in their exchange rates (Ocampo, 2016),
resulting in reduced monetary policy autonomy and a violation of
the ‘impossible trinity’ condition. These adverse effects are particularly pronounced
in peripheral economies with structurally weak current accounts (Oliveira, 2011;
2012). From this Keynesian/Structuralist perspective, the implementation of capital controls
and macroprudential policies should be considered as permanent tools for
peripheral economies to address the structural asymmetries of the contemporary
International Monetary and Financial System (IMFS). Such measures may partially
mitigate the negative consequences associated with currency inconvertibility.
