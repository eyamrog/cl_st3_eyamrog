Bagrobdella vanhovei exhibits considerable variability in its morphometric characters (Fig.
12), with small, medium, and large measurements observed for similar
hard parts. This variation may be attributed to two main
factors: (1) the presence of multiple species, or (2) the
use of different mounting media during slide preparation (see Fankoua
et al. 2017). However, given that no morphological differences were
observed between “large” and “small” specimens, and that both size
classes were found together on the same slides prepared with
the same medium, it is most likely that B. vanhovei
represents a single species characterized by substantial variability in the
size of its haptoral hard parts.
