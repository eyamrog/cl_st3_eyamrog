The presence of unethical website operators in scholarly publishing is
well documented, as it is in other sectors. Acknowledging this
issue, the present study, in line with previous research, demonstrates
that insufficient transparency at key stages of the scholarly publishing
process can result in the excessive application of the "predatory"
label to journals and publishers. Although this may raise awareness
of legitimate concerns, it also poses a risk to the
advancement of open access initiatives that support a more inclusive
global research community. This dynamic is particularly evident in the
industry's adoption of the "Think. Check. Submit." campaign, which, while
intended to guide authors in selecting appropriate publication venues, may
inadvertently contribute to a broader skepticism toward research literature outside
of well-established and widely recognized journals.
