Given the central characteristic of Undergraduate Scientific Research (USR)—which involves
shifting training towards a closer relationship between an experienced researcher
and a novice—mimesis emerges as a relevant and effective theoretical
framework for examining the issue of ethical training in research.
This is because, as will be discussed, such educational relationships
promote not only the acquisition of technical skills but also
the development of practical research competencies that inherently include ethical
considerations. By situating USR as the context and employing mimesis
as a theoretical construct, particularly drawing on the works of
Adorno and Benjamin, this study aims to underscore the significance
of the moral development of novice researchers within the broader
framework of research regulation.
