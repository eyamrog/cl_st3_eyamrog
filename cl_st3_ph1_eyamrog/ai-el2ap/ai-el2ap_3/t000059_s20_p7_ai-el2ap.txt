The relevance of journal size was further demonstrated when LILACS
journals were categorized by subject area or country of publication.
Figure 2 presents the mean values of each concentration index,
stratified by journal size, for the six countries with at
least 20 journals represented in the database, which includes a
total of 18 countries. Similarly, Figure 3 displays the mean
values of each concentration index, stratified by journal size, for
the six subjects with at least 20 journals among the
183 subjects included in the database. In both country and
subject groupings, larger journals exhibited a lower proportion of articles
authored by the most prolific contributor and a higher Gini
coefficient compared to smaller journals.
