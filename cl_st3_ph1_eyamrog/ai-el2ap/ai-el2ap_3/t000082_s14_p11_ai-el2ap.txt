We characterized coevolutionary dynamics by analyzing patterns in trait distributions
across species. To quantify trait disparity within the network, we
measured the average trait distance between species, using the mean
pairwise Euclidean distance (D) calculated across all possible species pairs,
following the method described by Ciampaglio et al. (2001). To
assess trait matching resulting from coevolutionary dynamics, we applied Ward's
hierarchical clustering algorithm (Ward 1963) in conjunction with the GAP
validation index, which serves as a pre-analysis tool to determine
the optimal number of clusters in a dataset (Tibshirani et
al. 2001). This approach allowed us to estimate the number
of distinct trait clusters among interacting species.
