Bagrobdella vanhovei possesses seven pairs of hooks of varying sizes
and a trapezoidal structure associated with the median projection of
the ventral bar (Fig. 6), the latter of which was
observed in 15 out of 78 examined specimens. Both of
these morphological features have been previously reported in the descriptions
of the four other recognized species within this genus. The
dorsal anchors of B. vanhovei are characterized by a long
point, whereas the ventral anchors have a very short point,
a condition also observed in B. auchenoglanii and B. fraudulenta;
in contrast, B. parauchenoglanii and B. anthopenis exhibit ventral and
dorsal anchors with points of similar length. Bagrobdella vanhovei can
be readily distinguished from all previously described species in the
genus by the unique morphology of its male copulatory organ
(MCO), which features a sub-terminal opening (Fig. 5).
