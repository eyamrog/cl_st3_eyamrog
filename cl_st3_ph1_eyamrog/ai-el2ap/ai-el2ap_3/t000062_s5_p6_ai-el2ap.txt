Spider families can be classified into five behavioral guilds as
described by Diniz (2011). In this study, the most frequently
collected families were those belonging to the Three-dimensional Web Builders
(TDW) guild, represented by Linyphiidae and Theridiidae, and the Night
Corridor (NC) guild, represented by Corinnidae and Xenoctenidae. TDW spiders
are generally associated with denser leaf architecture and show a
preference for plants with larger spaces between leaves (Diniz, 2011);
the statistical data obtained for Linyphiidae in this study support
their preference for open areas. However, the data for Theridiidae
are inconclusive and require further investigation to clarify their ecological
dynamics. NC guild spiders tend to prefer environments with complex
structural features, likely due to the increased protection against predators
and parasites provided by such plant architecture (Diniz, 2011), and
the higher occurrence of NC guild spiders in AD observed
in this study is consistent with existing literature.
