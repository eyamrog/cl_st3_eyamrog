Residuals of soil penetration resistance were evaluated using the Shapiro-Wilk
test, which indicated that the data did not follow a
normal distribution. Consequently, the Kruskal-Wallis test was applied, followed by
the post hoc Dunn test, to assess significant differences between
treatments. All statistical analyses were performed using PAST software with
a significance level of Î± < 0.05.
