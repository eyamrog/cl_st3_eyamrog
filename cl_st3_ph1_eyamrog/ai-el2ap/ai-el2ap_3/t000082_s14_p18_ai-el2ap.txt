In this study, 𝜀𝑖𝑗 is defined as a trait barrier
that determines whether a cheater species exerts selection pressure on
a victim species, whereas bij indicates that a potential mutualistic
or cheating interaction is precluded due to substantial trait dissimilarity
between partners. By incorporating bij into our model, we examined
how network structure evolves over time as a result of
the coevolutionary process. At each simulation timestep, we assessed whether
any interacting species pairs exhibited trait differences exceeding bij. In
accordance with equation 11, we removed these interactions, resulting in
interaction loss. Because our focus is on network changes driven
by interaction loss, once an interaction is removed, it remains
absent for the duration of the simulation and cannot be
re-established. Consequently, the interaction network at the end of a
simulation may differ structurally from the initial network due to
the removal of links. We subsequently compared the initial and
final network structures for each simulation.
