The data associated with the biological specimens deposited in FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB
are significant as they document the distribution of sand flies
across various regions of Brazil and provide extensive temporal coverage,
with specimens collected from 1939 to 2021. These data are
applicable to a range of research areas, including taxonomy and
systematics, ecological niche modeling, and other scientific investigations, as well
as vector control activities.
