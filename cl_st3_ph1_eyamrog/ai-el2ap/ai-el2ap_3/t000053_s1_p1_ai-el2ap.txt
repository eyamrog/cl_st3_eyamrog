The Amazonian phlebotomine fauna is recognized as among the most
diverse globally. The region also exhibits the highest prevalence of
leishmaniasis in Brazil and South America. Within this context, the
state of Acre is notable for both its diversity of
sand fly species and the incidence of American tegumentary leishmaniasis.
This dataset presents a bibliographic review of sand fly species
recorded in Acre State, located in the Amazon region of
Brazil. It includes a total of 1,096 observations derived from
material citation types, along with two records of preserved specimens,
and is structured using 32 variables in accordance with Darwin
Core standards. The bibliographic review was conducted using PubMed, Google
Scholar, SciELO, BVS (Biblioteca Virtual em Sa√∫de), and references cited
in related scientific articles. The resulting dataset provides a comprehensive
resource to support future research on sand fly fauna in
Acre and other states within the Amazon region.
