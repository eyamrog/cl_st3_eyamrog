Seed conservation is recognized as the most efficient and cost-effective
method for storing germplasm (Kaviani 2011). This approach has been
successfully applied to bromeliads, as demonstrated by studies on several
species. For example, seeds from six Encholirium species and two
Dyckia species maintained their germination rates after cryopreservation without the
use of cryoprotectants (Tarr√© et al. 2007). Similarly, research on
Encholirium spectabile Mart. ex Schult. & Schult.f. confirmed that cryoprotectants
are not required for effective seed cryopreservation (Ferrari et al.
2016). Additionally, seeds of Dyckia brevifolia Baker and Dyckia delicata
Larocca & Sobral exhibited post-cryopreservation germination rates of 92% and
79%, respectively, in the absence of cryoprotectants (de Paula et
al. 2020).
