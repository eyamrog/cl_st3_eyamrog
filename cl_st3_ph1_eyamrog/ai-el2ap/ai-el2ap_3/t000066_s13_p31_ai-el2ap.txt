I began conducting research on the coronavirus with the aim
of identifying effective treatments. My work has included investigations into
chloroquine and ivermectin, two drugs that have received significant attention
in Brazil; however, our findings indicate that these drugs are
not effective for treating COVID-19. Consequently, their use for this
purpose is not recommended. Our ongoing efforts are focused on
identifying therapeutics with demonstrated efficacy, a process that requires extensive
and rigorous research over an extended period to accurately assess
their effectiveness. I am actively involved in these frontline research
activities.
