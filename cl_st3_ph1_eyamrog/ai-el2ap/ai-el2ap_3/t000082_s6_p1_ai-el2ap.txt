We investigated the coevolutionary consequences of cheating interactions within mutualistic
networks. Our findings demonstrate that both trait evolution and network
structure can be influenced by the emergence of cheating strategies
in mutualistic relationships. While previous studies have examined the effects
of mutualisms and cheating interactions on population dynamics (Law et
al. 2001; Bronstein et al. 2003; Wilson et al. 2003;
Lee 2015) and phenotypic evolution (Ferriere et al. 2002), the
present study advances understanding of the coevolutionary dynamics in multispecies
assemblages in three distinct ways.
