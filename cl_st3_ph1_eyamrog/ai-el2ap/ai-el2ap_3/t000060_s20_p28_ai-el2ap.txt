With regard to formulations, three properties are identified: preservation, transformation,
and deletion. The original question, “After leaving that convention, did
you have any type of impressions about -- that you
learned from convention?”, is later reformulated as “Did you have
other impressions having to do with your life and where
your life was going?”. While the aspect concerning the interviewee’s
impressions is preserved, the focus shifts due to the deletion
of references to impressions specifically related to what was learned
from the convention, and the transformation of the question to
address other impressions pertaining to her life and its direction.
This reformulation semantically narrows the scope, as the defendant is
no longer asked about any type of impressions, but rather
about other impressions specifically related to her life and its
trajectory. Additionally, the discourse markers “well” and “you know” reappear
in Excerpt 6, functioning with the same pragmatic effects as
previously observed in Excerpts 4 and 5.
