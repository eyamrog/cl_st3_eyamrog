Scholz’s statements on foreign policy indicate a departure from Merkel’s
pragmatic approach, which was defined by a strong commitment to
the Minsk negotiations, participation in the Normandy Format, and regular
meetings between Chancellor Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin to
sustain dialogue with Russia (Rácz, 2022, p. 3). The new
coalition government is anticipated to adopt a more assertive stance
that aligns with United States policy preferences, viewing Merkel’s approach
as “naive” and comparable to the appeasement strategies of 1938
(Ripsman & Levy, 2008; Latham, 2021).
