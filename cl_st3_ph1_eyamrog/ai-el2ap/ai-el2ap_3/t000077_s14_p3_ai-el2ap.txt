We utilized monthly PNAD COVID-19 microdata from May to August
2020. The sample was restricted to individuals aged 16 to
65 who reported receiving labor income and were not attending
school, in order to avoid confounding work and study decisions.
Table 1 details the filtering process from the initial to
the final sample. The primary variable of interest, "worked-from-home," was
coded as 1 if the respondent answered affirmatively to the
question, “Last week, were you in remote work?” and as
0 for those who reported no change in their work
routine activities. The final sample comprised 419,840 observations, of which
46,261 (11.02%) indicated that they were working from home.
