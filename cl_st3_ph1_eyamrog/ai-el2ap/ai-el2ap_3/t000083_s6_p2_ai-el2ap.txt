Regarding construct validity, the exploratory factor analysis indicated that the
20 items of the scale loaded onto five factors, in
contrast to the original study by Balakrishnan and Griffiths (2017),
which identified six factors. This discrepancy may be attributable to
differences in the sample populations, as the original study was
conducted with college students, whereas the present study involved adolescents.
Previous research has shown that adolescents tend to be more
active in selfie posting compared to young adults or older
individuals, underscoring the importance of examining selfie-related behaviors in this
demographic (Dhir et al., 2016; Baiocco et al., 2016). Additionally,
cultural differences between Brazil and India may have contributed to
the reduction in the number of factors observed in the
Brazilian version of the scale. In contrast, studies assessing the
psychometric properties of the SBS in countries such as Iran
and Afghanistan reported the retention of six factors with satisfactory
fit indices in confirmatory factor analysis (Lin et al., 2019).
The Italian version of the SBS, similar to the Brazilian
version, also yielded a five-factor model (Monacis et al., 2020).
In the present study, the "mood modification" and "self-confidence" factors
were combined into a single factor labeled "mood and confidence,"
which demonstrated satisfactory communalities (above 0.62).
