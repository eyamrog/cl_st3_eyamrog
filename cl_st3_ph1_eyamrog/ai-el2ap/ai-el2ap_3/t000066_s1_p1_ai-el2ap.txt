This paper examines the core principles of play, collaboration, and
agency that underpin the online workshops organized by the Global
Play Brigade (GPB), an international collective of activists from diverse
fields who convened in response to the multifaceted global crisis
precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper outlines the theoretical
and methodological framework guiding the design and implementation of these
workshops, detailing their objectives and providing an account of one
specific session. The analysis draws on perspectives from Spinoza, Vygotsky,
Freire, and other relevant scholars to elucidate how participation in
such workshops may influence individuals toward social change. Recognizing the
complexity of the current global challenges, the GPB aims to
establish environments that foster creativity and critical thinking, thereby generating
opportunities for emotional support, personal development, hope, and collective action.
