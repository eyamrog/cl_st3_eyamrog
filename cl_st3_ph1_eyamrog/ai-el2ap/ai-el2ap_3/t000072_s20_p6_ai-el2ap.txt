Among the species identified in the present study, a potential
new record for São Paulo State was observed for Combretum
leprosum Mart., which was previously documented in semideciduous forests of
Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo States (Flora do Brasil 2020
2021). Queiroz et al. (2021) also reported the presence of
C. leprosum seedlings in the same study area and provided
evidence supporting the possible occurrence of this species in São
Paulo State. Continued floristic surveys may confirm the presence of
adult individuals of C. leprosum in the region, thereby highlighting
the value of seed bank studies as a tool for
documenting and understanding local flora.
