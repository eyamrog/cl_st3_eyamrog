However, following Adorno (1982, 2009), it is important to recognize
that while mimetic behavior is necessary, it is not sufficient
on its own and must be complemented by the development
of students' conceptual reasoning skills, which can only be achieved
through adequate and guided theoretical reflection. Although mimetic stimulation serves
as an effective means of sensitization, it must be accompanied
by deliberate rational engagement by the learner; otherwise, there is
a risk of promoting the misleading and potentially harmful notion
that the foundation of the moral domain is simplistic. This
caution is particularly relevant in contexts where numerous self-proclaimed codes
of ethics prevail, often concealing underlying interests in controlling scientific
activity and establishing norms intended to regulate research.
