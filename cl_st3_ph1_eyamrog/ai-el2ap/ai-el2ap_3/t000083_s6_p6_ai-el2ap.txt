The present study found that individuals with mild levels of
selfitis scored higher on the "mood and confidence" factor, which
encompasses items reflecting changes in mood and self-confidence associated with
selfie-taking behavior. Previous research indicates that positive mood changes and
enhanced self-confidence can reinforce such behaviors by activating the brain's
reward circuitry, thereby increasing the likelihood of repeated engagement and
potential addiction. In this study, participants reported that taking selfies
and privately viewing them before posting contributed to increased self-confidence.
Tajuddin et al. (2013) identified a positive relationship between self-confidence
and positive mood, specifically self-efficacy. Similarly, Meier and Gray (2013)
found that among American adolescents, higher frequencies of Facebook photo
postings were associated with greater self-confidence, whereas activities such as
viewing friends' photos, visiting others' profiles, commenting on friends' photos,
and unfollowing were linked to lower self-confidence indicators. Boursier and
Manna (2018) also reported that self-admiration can lead to increased
self-confidence, improved mood, and a greater desire to take and
post selfies. However, it is possible that the increase in
self-confidence is primarily experienced in the online context during the
act of posting selfies, which warrants further investigation. Additionally, social
media interaction via mobile digital devices has been shown to
assist individuals in overcoming negative mood states (McLean et al.,
2019), and Khan and Imran (2019) have reported that selfie
behavior is associated with mood regulation.
