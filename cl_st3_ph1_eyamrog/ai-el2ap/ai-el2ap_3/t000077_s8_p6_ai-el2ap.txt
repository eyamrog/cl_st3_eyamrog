Given the challenges associated with performing jobs that require face-to-face
interaction—primarily due to the transmission characteristics of Covid-19—and the government
classifications of essential activities, a central question addressed by recent
research is whether specific jobs can be performed remotely. Studies
by Yasenov (2020), Gallacher and Hossain (2020), Crowley and Doran
(2020), Brussevich et al. (2020), and Bartik et al. (2020)
have examined this issue in contexts such as the United
States, Ireland, Canada, and OECD countries. To date, most research
has focused on developed countries. Notable contributions in this area
include work by Balde et al. (2020), Estupinan et al.
(2021), Gottlieb et al. (2021), and Khamis et al. (2021).
While these studies differ in certain respects, they consistently identify
significant inequalities in the likelihood of engaging in remote work,
with disparities observed across dimensions such as income, age, education,
gender, and employment contract type, and with more limited opportunities
for remote work among vulnerable groups in the labor market.
