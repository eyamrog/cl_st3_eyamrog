This research indicates that Hedychium coronarium does not have a
direct effect on the population dynamics of soil spider assemblages.
Although significant differences were observed, these were not confirmed in
post-hoc analyses, suggesting that larger studies focusing on groups with
lower behavioral complexity, such as guilds, families, or species, may
be necessary to detect potential impacts. Weaver spiders exhibited a
preference for invaded areas (IA), while Linyphiidae demonstrated varying habitat
preferences depending on the time of year. In contrast, runner
spiders consistently preferred disturbed areas (DA) throughout the year. Further
studies investigating these ecological relationships in preserved sites are needed
to supplement the findings presented here, particularly given the widespread
invasion of H. coronarium in many conservation units in Brazil.
A better understanding of these interactions may contribute to the
protection of species, especially predatory arthropods such as spiders, which
play a significant role in regulating insect populations.
