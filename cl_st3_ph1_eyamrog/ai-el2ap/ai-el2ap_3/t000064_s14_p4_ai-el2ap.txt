The IRGA was calibrated to maintain an airflow of 500
µL s⁻¹ and a reference carbon dioxide concentration of 400
ppm. The relative humidity of the reference air was similar
across treatments, with values as follows: control group, 45%; in
vitro plantlets, 38%; greenhouse seedlings, 36%; and garden condition, 44%.
Air temperature during measurements was within a physiologically favorable range
for all groups: control group, 25.5 ± 0.5 °C; in
vitro plantlets, 26.0 ± 0.1 °C; greenhouse seedlings, 30.4 ±
0.7 °C; and garden condition, 31.3 ± 1.2 °C. Light
intensities were predetermined and ranged from 0 to 1,600 µmol
m⁻² s⁻¹.
