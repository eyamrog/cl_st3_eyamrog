Another important consideration during corpus compilation was the inclusion of
texts representing different academic levels, as this learner variable may
influence language use; participants in the study could be either
undergraduate or graduate students (see Figure 1). Since the IFA
subjects are elective, students from both academic levels are eligible
to enroll.
