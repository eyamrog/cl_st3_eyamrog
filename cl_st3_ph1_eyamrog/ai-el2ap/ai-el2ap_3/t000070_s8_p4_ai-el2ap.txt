An effective alternative for the long-term conservation of plant materials
is the establishment of a cryopreservation protocol, which enables safe
and efficient storage. These protocols can be applied to a
wide range of plant species and utilize various types of
explants, including seeds, zygotic embryos, apical buds, and meristems (Engelmann
2011). Direct cryopreservation is a relatively straightforward method that involves
the direct immersion of either fresh or dehydrated plant material
in liquid nitrogen (LN). Following storage, the material is typically
retrieved by reheating in water at 40 Â°C, which allows
for subsequent regeneration of the preserved material (Popova et al.
2016).
