Although this activity may initially appear simple or merely recreational,
it effectively facilitated connections among participants by encouraging them to
share their preferences and habits. This process enabled participants to
recognize the pervasive nature of diversity and to consider the
various ways individuals may experience it. Furthermore, the activity highlighted
the existence of commonalities among participants, despite potential disagreements, and
underscored a shared desire for mutual respect. Within this framework,
play functions as a meaningful and transformative activity (Newman &
Holzman, 2002), prompting participants to reflect on themselves and others
as part of their ongoing personal development (Liberali, 2019).
