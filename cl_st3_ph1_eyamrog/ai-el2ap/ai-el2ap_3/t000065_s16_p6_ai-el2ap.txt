The corpus comprises a range of academic registers, including statements
of purpose and research papers. Students produce these texts as
part of their course requirements, adhering to instructors’ guidelines regarding
word count and topic selection. The distribution of registers is
progressive, beginning with genres such as statements of purpose or
summaries in IFA I and culminating in research papers or
literature reviews in IFA V. Following the submission of an
initial draft, instructors tailor instruction on the relevant register to
address students’ specific needs. Each course includes multiple exercises for
each register, as well as opportunities for text revision. Students
subsequently submit a second and/or third draft, which is subject
to further editing and grading. For the purposes of corpus
compilation, these texts are classified as either unedited or edited
versions.
