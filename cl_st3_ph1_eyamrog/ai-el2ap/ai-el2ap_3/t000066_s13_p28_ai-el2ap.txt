The testimonial presented in Excerpt 1 appeared to have a
significant impact on all participants, likely influenced by the contemporaneous
global attention to the Black Lives Matter demonstrations in the
United States and, in Brazil, by widespread media coverage of
the death of Miguel, a five-year-old Black child who died
after being left unattended by his motherâ€™s employer in a
high-rise apartment. Observational data indicated that participants were highly engaged
with the testimonial, as evidenced by their nonverbal responses such
as nodding in agreement and displaying facial expressions of surprise
while attentively watching or listening to each testimonial shared within
the group.
