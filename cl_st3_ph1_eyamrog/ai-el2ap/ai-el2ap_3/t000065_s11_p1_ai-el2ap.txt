The varieties of English spoken as an additional language significantly
outnumber native-speaker varieties, which has motivated the study of non-native
spoken and written English. This area of inquiry is known
as learner corpus research (LCR), a term that encompasses interlanguage
studies grounded in corpus linguistics (Granger et al., 2015). A
corpus is defined as a “collection of pieces of language
text in electronic form” (Sinclair, 2005: 19), compiled according to
specific criteria to represent a particular language or language variety.
The process of corpus compilation involves establishing clear and comprehensive
criteria regarding the mode (e.g., written), type (e.g., research article),
and domain (e.g., academic) of the texts, as well as
the language or language varieties (e.g., learner English), the geographical
location of the texts (e.g., compiled in Brazil), and the
period of text production (e.g., 2015–2020), as outlined by Sinclair
(2005). Corpus linguistics, which emphasizes the description of language use,
employs various linguistic software tools to facilitate both quantitative and
qualitative analyses of learner language. Its advantages include the ability
to process large datasets and to generalize findings across comparable
groups. Consequently, a well-designed corpus is considered representative of the
target population, as noted by Biber.
