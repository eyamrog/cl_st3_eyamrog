Based on the activity sectors defined by IBGE, this study
examines the concentration of activities within each SBD. Overall, SBDs
predominantly exhibit a concentration in service-related activities. As shown in
Table 7, the highest employment concentrations are observed in construction
(Campo Belo); credit institutions, insurance, and capitalization (Itaim Bibi); management,
administration, real estate, securities, and technical services (Vila Mariana, Santa
Cecilia, Pinheiros); and medical, dental, and veterinary services (Jardim Paulista).
Bel√©m is the only SBD where manufacturing activities account for
the highest concentration of employment.
