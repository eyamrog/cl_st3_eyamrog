The development of the Latin American economy has the potential
to leverage its significant biodiversity, which presents both an opportunity
and a challenge, as these resources are also critical to
conserve. The primary framework for this approach is the bioeconomy,
which emphasizes the efficient utilization of biological and natural resources,
as well as the recycling of associated waste. This model
offers several advantages, including a reduction in reliance on fossil
fuel-derived energy and a decrease in carbon emissions (Hodson, Henry,
& Trigo, 2019).
