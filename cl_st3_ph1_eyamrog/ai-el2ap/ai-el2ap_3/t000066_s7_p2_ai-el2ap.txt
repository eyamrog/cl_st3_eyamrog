This need was one of the primary factors that motivated
the Global Play Brigade (GPB) to assemble a diverse group
of artists, improvisers, educators, musicians, clowns, therapists, and other activists
from nearly 40 countries to provide free online workshops to
individuals worldwide. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic spread
globally, technological platforms such as ZOOM, WhatsApp, and Facebook enabled
these activists—referred to as Brigadiers—to connect with participants. They subsequently
launched a website featuring an extensive list of activities accessible
to anyone affected by social distancing measures and interested in
the topics addressed.
