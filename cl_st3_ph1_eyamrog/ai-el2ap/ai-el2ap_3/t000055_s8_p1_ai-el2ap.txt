Biological collections serve as repositories of biodiversity, housing specimens and
associated data that are utilized in various scientific research fields
[1]. These collections are particularly significant for insects of medical
and veterinary relevance, where precise taxonomic identification is essential for
understanding and managing the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases [2]. The
“Coleção de Flebotomíneos” (Collection of Phlebotomines), maintained at the Instituto
René Rachou, Fiocruz Minas (FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB), a federal public health research
institution in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil, is a specialized
biological collection of sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae, Phlebotominae). Sand flies
are of notable medical and public health importance due to
the role of blood-feeding adult females in transmitting protozoan parasites
of the genus Leishmania, the causative agents of leishmaniases, as
well as other bacterial and viral pathogens that affect both
human and non-human vertebrates [3]. Specimens in FIOCRUZ/COLFLEB originate from
a range of research projects conducted over approximately the past
80 years, encompassing both areas with active disease transmission and
wild environments without recorded cases. The sand flies are typically
collected using light traps and are identified by trained specialists
employing established taxonomic keys [2,4]. These specimens support research in
taxonomy and systematics [5,6,7], and the associated data facilitate applications
such as ecological niche and species distribution modeling [8], among
other scientific uses [9].
