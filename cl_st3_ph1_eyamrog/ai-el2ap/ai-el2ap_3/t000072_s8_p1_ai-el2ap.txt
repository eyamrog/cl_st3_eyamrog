When vegetation is situated in proximity to watercourses, it is
referred to as riparian forest, which is defined as a
transitional zone extending from the boundary of the watercourse to
the edge of adjacent uplands. This area is strongly influenced
by the hydrological regime and is characterized by a high
degree of habitat heterogeneity (Naiman et al. 2005).
