The Morumbi district exhibits a statistically significant coefficient with the
expected sign, as predicted by theoretical models, following a 10%
increase in the distance cut-off. In contrast, the coefficient for
region A7 is no longer statistically significant, although its sign
remains consistent with theoretical expectations. Additionally, the coefficients estimating the
commuting effect for areas A4, A28, and A32 are statistically
significant under both specifications of the spatial weight matrices.
