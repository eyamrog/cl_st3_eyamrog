The conservation of forest fragments is essential for the maintenance
and subsequent propagation of species. Even in the absence of
anthropogenic activities intended to relocate propagules, local fauna play a
significant role in their dispersal. Neto et al. (2020) demonstrated
that abandoned eucalyptus areas located near preserved forest fragments can
serve as favorable sites for the natural regeneration of native
species, primarily due to their proximity to these fragments. Consequently,
by conducting cost-effective assessments of the soil seed bank, including
cataloging floristic composition and species density, it is possible to
develop effective strategies for promoting ecological succession in areas requiring
restoration (Martins 2001; Brancalion et al. 2015).
