The actions of the LACE Research Group are grounded in
the principles of Applied Linguistics (AL), a field that examines
how language shapes human behavior and social interactions, as well
as the underlying attitudes present in everyday life. Applied Linguistics
emphasizes the importance of adopting a critical perspective on social
issues and encourages interdisciplinary collaboration with fields such as Education,
Psychology, Sociology, and Philosophy (Moita Lopes, 2006). The primary objective
of AL is to explore and integrate diverse discourses and
practices that contribute to the construction of reality through various
modes of expression, emotion, and action. Additionally, the LACE Research
Group adopts a socio-historical-cultural approach informed by Vygotskian theory, which
will be further elaborated in this paper.
