The chlorophyll content was slightly higher in plants grown in
the greenhouse compared to those grown in vitro, but significantly
lower than in plants cultivated in the garden (Table 1).
Garden-grown plants exhibited greater chlorophyll content than greenhouse-grown plants, but
still less than wild plants; their leaves displayed a lighter
green coloration, which did not indicate chlorosis, as the color
intensity was uniformly distributed (Figure 5). Anatomical analysis demonstrated that
environmental and growth conditions influenced the leaf structure of V.
squamata (Figure 6). In all samples, the epidermis was single-layered
and lacked trichomes. Leaves from field-grown (control group) and garden-grown
plants (Figures 6a, f) had a smooth abaxial surface and
a corrugated adaxial surface. In contrast, leaves from in vitro
plantlets and greenhouse-acclimatized plants (Figures 6d, e) showed no visible
epidermal ornamentation.
