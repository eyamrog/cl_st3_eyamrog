Antagonistic and mutualistic interactions are not isolated phenomena in nature
but frequently coexist within ecological communities. Previous studies have examined
the combined effects of mutualisms and antagonisms on population dynamics
(e.g., Melián et al. 2009), community stability (e.g., Wilson et
al. 2003), and network structure (e.g., Genini et al. 2010),
emphasizing the necessity of accounting for the diverse outcomes that
interactions can produce within a single community and recognizing that
mutualism and antagonism represent endpoints along a continuum (Fontaine et
al. 2011, Rodríguez-Rodríguez et al. 2017). Individuals of the same
species may function as either antagonists or mutualists toward the
same interacting species; for example, seed-caching rodents can act both
as seed predators and as seed dispersers for the same
plant species (Loayza et al. 2014). In other cases, individuals
may serve as antagonists to some species while acting as
mutualists to others (Gómez et al. 2018, Gómez et al.
2014, Montesinos-Navarro et al. 2017). Additionally, some species include individuals
that are specialized cheaters, engaging in mutualistic interactions without providing
reciprocal benefits, as observed in certain fig wasps and yucca
moths (Bronstein 2001). Consequently, in mutualistic systems, natural selection may
favor the evolution of life histories that exploit the resources
and services offered by mutualistic partners without reciprocation, a phenomenon
referred to as cheating interactions (Bronstein 2001, Vieira et al.
2003).
