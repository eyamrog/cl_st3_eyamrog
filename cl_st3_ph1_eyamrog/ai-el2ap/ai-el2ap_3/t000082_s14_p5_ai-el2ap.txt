By integrating the three selection components outlined above (equations 1,
2, and 3), the evolutionary change in Zi at timestep
t+1 is expressed as: <>, where φi represents a composite
parameter incorporating both additive genetic variance and the slope of
the adaptive landscape. The parameter ϒi quantifies the relative influence
of ecological interactions compared to environmental factors as selective pressures.
Consequently, in this model, trait evolution is defined as: <>.
