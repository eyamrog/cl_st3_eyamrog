Intracellular ice crystal formation represents the most detrimental event during
cryopreservation, as the resulting damage is irreversible. This phenomenon can
occur during either the freezing or thawing phases and may
result in cell wall rupture, epidermal rupture, protoplast leakage, abnormal
nuclei in surviving explants, or explant death (Kaviani 2011). Anatomical
investigations, such as those conducted by Wesley-Smith et al. (2014,
2015), highlight the significance of understanding the relationship between water
content and ice structure in order to optimize cryogenic protocols
and enhance cell survival, given that both ice crystal size
and the extent of cellular damage can have delayed effects
on cell viability.
