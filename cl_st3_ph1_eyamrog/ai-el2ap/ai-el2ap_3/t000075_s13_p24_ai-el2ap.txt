This strand of the literature on capital controls includes the
study by Fern√°ndez et al. (2016), which utilizes a database
documenting various financial assets subject to regulatory controls. The authors
assess the effectiveness of capital controls by examining the co-movements
between different regulatory measures and by constructing an aggregate control
indicator. The analysis of co-movements involves calculating the correlation between
controls imposed on different financial assets, as well as between
controls on inflows and outflows over time. For 'gate' countries,
which imposed capital controls sporadically, the results show a moderate
correlation between controls on the most liquid class of financial
assets and both inflow and outflow controls. In contrast, 'wall'
countries, which maintained capital controls on a permanent basis, exhibit
a high correlation, particularly between controls on the most liquid
assets and financial credit, for both inflow and outflow controls.
