Another significant contribution of these mainstream studies is the examination
of the relative effectiveness of prudential measures and capital controls
implemented by developed and emerging economies, alongside the analysis of
spillover effects. These studies provide valuable insights for the ongoing
debate regarding the multilateral dimensions of capital controls and are
therefore essential for future discussions on the international coordination of
capital flow management measures (CFMs). Evidence indicates that prudential measures,
which differentiate based on the currency denomination of transactions and
are typically adopted by developed countries, have been more effective
in reducing the volume of cross-border capital flows compared to
capital controls, which distinguish based on the investorâ€™s residency and
are more commonly used by emerging markets. These conclusions are
supported by the findings of Binici et al. (2010), Ghosh
et al. (2014), and Aizenman and Binici (2016). Figure 2
summarizes the relative effectiveness of CFMs implemented by developing and
developed economies, with the latter primarily employing prudential policies.
