This initial stage of mimesis is of fundamental importance. During
this period, the family and the school are typically the
primary institutions responsible for introducing the world to new generations,
primarily through example and the environment they create, rather than
through explicit instruction. In the absence of fully developed conceptual
understanding, children engage with reality by incorporating and imitating observed
behaviors. Rites, gestures, and reactions are imprinted on the unconscious
of children and persist throughout their lives. If the environment
is characterized by repression of bodily expression, mimesis retains its
archaic qualities, manifesting as an immediate and unstable process rooted
in fear of difference. According to Gagnebin’s (1993: 76) analysis
of Adorno, this dynamic can lead to a “social process
of perverse identification… [in which] the individual fear of regression
to the amorphous would engender a totalitarian collective regression, whose
most complete expression is fascism.” Totalitarian regimes intensify this archaic
fear of difference, promoting identification with a charismatic leader who
employs rhetoric that capitalizes on superficial understandings of reality.
