The most prolific author in each journal had a median
of 8 articles, accounting for 4.5% of the signed articles,
with the 95th percentile reaching 12.9% (Table 1). In one
quarter of the journals, more than one author shared the
status of most prolific author. The highest observed percentage was
61.7%, recorded in Universitas Scientiarum, a journal with 81 signed
articles, which identifies the editor on the first page of
each article; in many cases, articles in SciELO and records
in LILACS list the editor as one of the authors.
This journal was excluded from panels A and C of
Figure 1 to improve visualization. Consistent with the findings of
Scanff et al. (2021), the proportion of articles authored by
the most prolific author was lower and exhibited less variability
in journals with a higher total number of articles (panel
A in Figure 1).
