Crowley and Doran (2020) identify agriculture, forestry, fishing, construction, transportation
and storage, and mining and quarrying as the economic sectors
in Ireland with the lowest potential for remote work. In
industries where such occupations are prevalent, workers face a choice
between ceasing production or accepting increased health risks in order
to maintain operations, as remote work is not a viable
option (Bartik et al., 2020).
