Identification. This species is distinguished by a plicate peridium present
on both the internal and external surfaces, large peridioles measuring
7–10 mm × 6–7 mm with a bilayered cortex, and
peridioles that are dark brown to black in color. The
basidiospores measure 10–12 × 16–22 μm. Additionally, a woolly golden-brown
subiculum is formed at the base of the pseudostipe, which
serves as a further diagnostic characteristic (Brodie & Dennis 1954;
Trierveiler-Pereira & Baseia 2010).
