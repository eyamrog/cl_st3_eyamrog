The parallelodromous leaf veins of control plants, both from the
garden and greenhouse, exhibited a prominent vascular bundle sheath (Figures
6a, e–f). The bundle sheaths in these plants possessed adaxial
extensions composed of large, colorless palisade cells identified as aquiferous
tissue (Figures 6a, e–f). This parenchyma established a connection between
the bundle sheath and the subepidermal fiber fascicles located on
the adaxial epidermis (Figures 6a, e–f). On the abaxial side,
the bundle sheath was in direct contact with the epidermis
(Figures 6a, e–f). In contrast, leaves from in vitro plants
displayed bundle sheaths that lacked these extensions (Figure 6d).
