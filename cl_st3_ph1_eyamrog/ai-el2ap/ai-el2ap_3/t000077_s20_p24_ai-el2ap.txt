Gottlieb et al. (2021) indicate that more educated and salaried
employees, as opposed to self-employed individuals or employers, are more
likely to work from home, even after controlling for specific
types of work. This finding suggests that while the propensity
for remote work varies across different occupations, there is also
significant heterogeneity within individual occupations.
