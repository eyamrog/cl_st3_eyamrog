Mimicry is not exclusive to humans; research in the biological
sciences has documented this behavior in various animal species, including
flies, butterflies, and snakes (Futuyma, 1997; Ricklefs, 1996). A well-documented
example is the chameleon, which alters its skin color in
response to threats to achieve environmental camouflage. In contrast, certain
species of flies exhibit mimicry not by blending into their
surroundings, but by resembling predators, thereby reducing the likelihood of
being identified as prey. Beyond its primary function of protection,
mimicry also serves as a mechanism for communication and learning
through imitation in mammals. This has been empirically observed in
at least one species of bear, several primate species (Taylor
et al., 2019), and in humans, who are considered particularly
adept at learning through mimicry (Wulf, 2016: 555).
