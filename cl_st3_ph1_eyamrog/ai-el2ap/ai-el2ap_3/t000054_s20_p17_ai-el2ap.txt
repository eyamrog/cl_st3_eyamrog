Mescaline is not exclusive to Lophophora williamsii, as several South
American species of the genus Trichocereus also synthesize this alkaloid
(Cassels & SÃ¡ez 2018). However, Lophophora williamsii is uniquely associated
with the cultural practices of shamanism, religious rituals, and visionary
experiences among Mexican groups such as the Tarahumaras, the Coras,
and particularly the Huicholes (Clavijo 2018).
