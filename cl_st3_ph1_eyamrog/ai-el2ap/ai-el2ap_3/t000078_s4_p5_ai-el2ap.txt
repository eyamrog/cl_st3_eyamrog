The identification of SBDs is influenced by the choice of
geographical scale, as noted by Anas et al. (1998). Altering
the spatial units of analysis, such as using municipal districts
or dividing the municipality into 1 kmÂ² grid cells, can
lead to different results. To address this limitation, it is
advisable to incorporate the precise spatial locations of firms and
explicitly consider the modifiable areal unit problem. This approach would
allow for the identification of SBDs that are not constrained
by the administrative boundaries defined by the IBGE, enabling the
detection of spatial patterns such as corridor-shaped SBDs. Furthermore, if
all identified SBDs are spatially connected, the total number of
SBDs identified may decrease, potentially resulting in fewer than the
originally observed seven SBDs.
