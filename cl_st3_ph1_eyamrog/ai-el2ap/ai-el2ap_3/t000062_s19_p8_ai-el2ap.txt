Theridiidae was represented by 37 individuals, with 16 (43%) collected
in the DA, 13 (35%) in the IA, and 8
(22%) in the FA. The Shapiro-Wilk test indicated a significant
deviation from normality in the DA (W = 0.7500; P
< 0.0001); however, this result was not corroborated by the
Kruskal-Wallis test or Dunnâ€™s post-hoc test with Bonferroni adjustment, which
did not detect significant differences among the areas. Analysis by
season showed no significant differences during the hot and humid
period. In the cold and dry period, no significant differences
were observed between DA and IA, and no individuals from
the family were collected in the FA.
