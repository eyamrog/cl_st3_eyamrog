The Selfitis Behavior Scale (SBS) is an instrument developed by
Balakrishnan and Griffiths (2017) to assess behaviors associated with taking
selfies, referred to as selfitis. In their original study involving
225 Indian university students with a mean age of 20
years, exploratory factor analysis identified six underlying factors: environmental enhancement,
social competition, attention seeking, mood modification, self-confidence, and subjective conformity.
The SBS consists of 20 items rated on a five-point
Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly
agree), with higher scores reflecting greater engagement in selfie-taking behaviors.
Total scores between 20 and 40 indicate low selfitis behavior,
scores from 41 to 60 indicate mild selfitis behavior, scores
from 61 to 80 indicate moderate selfitis behavior, and scores
from 81 to 100 indicate a severe level of selfitis
behavior.
