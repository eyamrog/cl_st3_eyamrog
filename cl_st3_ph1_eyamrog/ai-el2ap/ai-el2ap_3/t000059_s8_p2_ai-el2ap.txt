A recent high-profile scandal involving editors affiliated with the same
institution as the authors prompted Locher et al. (2021) to
propose an authorship concentration index, defined as the proportion of
articles authored by the most prolific contributor, as a potential
indicator of endogeneity in academic publishing. Subsequently, Scanff et al.
(2021) introduced a second metric, the Gini coefficient of inequality,
and validated both indices using a representative sample of journals
indexed in MEDLINE. Their findings indicated that when either index
exceeded the 95th percentile, the most prolific author was more
likely to be a member of the journal’s editorial board.
Additionally, these authors were more likely to have their articles
accepted within less than three weeks, with the publication lag
being even shorter in journals where the most prolific author
contributed a higher number of articles. As noted by Scanff
et al. (2021), although there are legitimate reasons for editors
to publish in their own journals and for prolific authors
to experience shorter evaluation times, both authorship concentration indices can
serve as tools to identify journals that may exhibit endogenous
practices, sometimes referred to as “self-promotion journals” (Locher et al.,
2021) or “nepotistic journals” (Scanff et al., 2021).
