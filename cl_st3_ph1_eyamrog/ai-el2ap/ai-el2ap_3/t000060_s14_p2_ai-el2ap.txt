To compile the corpus, all publicly available materials related to
Ariasâ€™s trial were collected from the Internet, including all accessible
trial videos on YouTube and the transcripts released to the
media online. Notably, according to the multi-platform news and information
media company USA TODAY, Arias testified without media presence during
her sentencing retrial, and the Court of Appeals subsequently ordered
the release of her testimony transcripts.
