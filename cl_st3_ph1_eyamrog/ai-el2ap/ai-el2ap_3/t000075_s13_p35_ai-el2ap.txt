Given recent evidence on the effectiveness of capital controls, several
economists have sought to identify the categories of capital flows
for which the use of capital flow management measures (CFMs)
would be theoretically desirable. In this context, the study by
Blanchard et al. (2017) is notable for its theoretical innovation
within conventional open economy models. The authors differentiate capital flows
to emerging economies into two categories: bond flows, which include
debt securities, and non-bond flows, which primarily consist of equity
instruments and foreign direct investment (FDI). This classification is used
to assess whether specific capital flows have expansionary or contractionary
effects. According to Blanchard et al., bond flows are contractionary,
as indicated by the IS-LM-BP framework, because they tend to
appreciate the exchange rate without contributing to an expansion of
domestic credit denominated in foreign currency. In contrast, non-bond flows
can be either expansionary or contractionary, depending on their net
impact on economic activity. Non-bond flows both appreciate the exchange
rate and expand domestic credit backed by foreign currency; if
the credit expansion effect outweighs the appreciation effect, the overall
impact is expansionary. Therefore, capital controls on bond inflows are
always considered desirable, while controls on non-bond inflows are only
warranted if their net effect is contractionary (Blanchard et al.,
2017).
