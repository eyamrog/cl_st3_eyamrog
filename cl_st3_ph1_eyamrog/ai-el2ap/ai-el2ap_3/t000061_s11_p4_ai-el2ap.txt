Adorno’s engagement with the concept of mimesis begins with a
critical and largely negative stance, particularly evident in Dialectic of
Enlightenment (co-authored with Horkheimer), but he subsequently re-evaluates and develops
the concept in later works such as Negative Dialectics and
Aesthetic Theory (Bassani and Vaz, 2011). It is important to
note that, due to this evolution in his analysis, some
scholars argue that Adorno did not succeed in establishing mimesis
as a theoretically coherent category (see Freitas, 2001). However, others
contend that the transformation of the concept across Adorno’s oeuvre
enables a more comprehensive analysis of mimesis, which is a
central concern of this article.
