The species richness estimators that most closely approximated the total
number of observed species were Bootstrap and Jackknife 1, which
indicated the potential presence of 24 to 31 species (Figure
5a). This result was obtained when species richness was analyzed
per treatment, with only the Bootstrap estimator falling within the
standard deviation across all three treatments (FA, IA, and DA).
Jackknife 2 and Chao 1 produced the highest estimates and
were therefore the least conservative, while Jackknife 1 and Bootstrap
provided the most conservative estimates. The IA treatment exhibited the
smallest difference between estimators (Figure 5c), whereas the DA and
FA treatments showed the greatest differences between estimators (Figures 5b
and 5d).
