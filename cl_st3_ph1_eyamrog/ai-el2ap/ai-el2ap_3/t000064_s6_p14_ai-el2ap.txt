After this initial period, the leaves not only become photosynthetically
active but also frequently exhibit anatomical modifications, such as increased
cellular growth accompanied by reduced stomatal density and the differentiation
of trichomes (Van Huylenbroeck et al. 1998; Kaur 2015). In
both functional groups, leaves that developed in vitro under shaded
conditions are unable to tolerate higher environmental light intensities; however,
newly formed leaves that develop under intermediate light intensities tend
to display light compensation and light saturation points similar to
those observed in wild plants, as well as a more
developed photoprotective apparatus (Van Huylenbroeck et al. 1998; Kaur 2015).
