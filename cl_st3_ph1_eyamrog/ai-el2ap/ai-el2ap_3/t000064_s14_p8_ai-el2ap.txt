Statistical analysis: The light response curves were fitted to the
model of Prado and Moraes (1997): Ameas = Amax (1
- e^(-k(PAR - Lcp))), where Ameas represents the carbon assimilation
rate at a given light intensity, Amax is the maximum
measured carbon assimilation rate, k is a constant determined for
each curve, PAR denotes the incident photosynthetically active radiation, and
Lcp is the light compensation point. Data were compared using
Studentâ€™s t-test, and all analyses were performed using the open-source
software LibreOffice.
