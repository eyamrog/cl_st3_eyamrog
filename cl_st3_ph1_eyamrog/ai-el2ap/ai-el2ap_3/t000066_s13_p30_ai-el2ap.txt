Life in this area has changed significantly since March. I
do not feel entirely comfortable going out or engaging in
regular activities. Although the situation in New York was challenging,
it was manageable to some extent because we responded appropriately
and were able to reduce the rate of infection. My
English classes transitioned to an online format, as was the
case in many other places. This adjustment was somewhat difficult
for me, as I prefer in-person interaction with teachers and
classmates and value opportunities for direct communication; the online environment
felt isolating due to the lack of social contact. However,
there were no alternative options available at the time. Currently,
daily life is gradually returning to normal, and I am
optimistic that conditions will continue to improve.
