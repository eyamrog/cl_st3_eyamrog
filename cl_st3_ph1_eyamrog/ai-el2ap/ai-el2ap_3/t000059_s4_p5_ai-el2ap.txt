Further research is required to provide a more rigorous analysis
of the relationship between journal size and authorship concentration indexes.
Specifically, it is important to determine how changes in the
number of signed articles in a hypothetically non-endogenous journal would
affect these indexes. Such insights would facilitate more accurate interpretation
of authorship concentration measures and enable more reliable comparisons across
countries or subject areas. Additionally, this knowledge would help clarify
whether larger journals tend to exhibit higher or lower levels
of endogeneity compared to smaller journals.
