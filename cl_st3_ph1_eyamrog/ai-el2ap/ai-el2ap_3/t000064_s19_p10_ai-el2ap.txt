The vascular bundles exhibited a high degree of fibrosity, with
two strands of phloem positioned laterally to the xylem (Figures
6a, e–f). This characteristic was less evident in leaves derived
from in vitro plants (Figure 6d). The vascular fibres possessed
thick, lignified cell walls (Figures 6a, e–f). Quantitatively, vascular fibres
were most abundant in control plants, present at intermediate levels
in greenhouse plants, and least abundant in in vitro plants
(Figures 6a, e–f).
