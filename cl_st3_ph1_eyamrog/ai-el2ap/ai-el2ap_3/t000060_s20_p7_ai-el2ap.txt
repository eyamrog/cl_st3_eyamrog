The discourse marker "correct" functions to prompt the interviewee to
align with the interviewer’s account of events, consistent with the
observation that “the attorney’s questions are designed to elicit ‘yes’/’no’
confirmatory answers” (Holt & Johnson, 2010, p. 34). In this
instance, Arias does not provide the explicit affirmative response anticipated
by Martinez (e.g., “Yes, that is correct”), but she also
does not explicitly reject his version. By responding with “that
makes sense,” Arias refrains from disconfirming the interviewer’s interpretation, thereby
allowing the interviewer to achieve the intended confirmation.
