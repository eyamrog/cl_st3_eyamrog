The following two procedures are modifications of the original method
proposed by McDonald (1987), which analyzes the residuals from a
log density specification of employment. Craig and Ng (2001) address
the issue of subjectivity present in the earlier approach by
employing quantile regression, specifically targeting the 95th percentile of the
employment density distribution. Their method selects rings with high density
and employment based on their understanding of the city. However,
McMillen (2001b) criticizes this approach for assuming a symmetric density
function around the central business district (CBD) and for relying
on the researcher's prior knowledge of the city's employment distribution.
