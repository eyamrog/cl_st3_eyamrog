Bagrobdella vanhovei and B. vansteenbergei are newly described species that
are endemic to Lake Tanganyika. In contrast, the four previously
known species of Bagrobdella have been reported from different geographic
locations: B. auchenoglanii was originally described in Ghana, with subsequent
redescriptions based on specimens from Mali and Togo; B. anthopenis
was described from Mali; B. fraudulenta has been recorded in
both Uganda and Mali (Euzet and Le Brun 1990); and
B. parauchenoglani was recently described from Cameroon (Akoumba et al.
2017).
