The regressions indicate that regulatory measures imposed by source countries
on capital outflows were relatively more effective than the inflow
controls implemented by recipient economies (Ghosh et al., 2014). Based
on these findings, the authors argue for the necessity of
global coordination of capital controls and other regulatory measures, both
between source and recipient economies and among recipient economies themselves,
as such coordination has the potential to mitigate currency wars,
as discussed in Korinek (2012).
