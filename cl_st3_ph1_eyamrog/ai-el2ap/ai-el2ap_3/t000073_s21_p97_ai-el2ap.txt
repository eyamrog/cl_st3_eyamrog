Identification. This species is distinguished by its large basidiomata, which
can reach up to 8 cm in diameter, involute lacinias,
non-hygroscopic nature, and a prominent, conspicuous collar around the endoperidium
derived from the pseudoparenchymal layer of the exoperidium. Additional diagnostic
features include a sessile endoperidium and a fibrous peristoma that
may be either delimited or unbounded (Campi et al. 2018).
Recent phylogenetic analyses indicate that the current morphological concept of
this species encompasses a complex of closely related taxa that
differ in their distribution patterns (Kasuya et al. 2012).
