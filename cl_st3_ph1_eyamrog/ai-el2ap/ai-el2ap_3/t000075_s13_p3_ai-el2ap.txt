Advanced economies exhibit more effective risk sharing compared to emerging
economies, primarily due to a higher degree of financial integration
and interconnection among advanced economies, as demonstrated by Kose et
al. (2009), Bluedorn et al. (2013), and Lane and Milesi-Ferretti
(2007). As a result, consumption volatility in emerging economies has
not consistently declined; in fact, several studies, including Prasad et
al. (2003) and Levy-Yeyati and Calder√≥n (2009), report that consumption
volatility has increased during certain periods.
