Gallery forests, also referred to as riparian forests, are found
along small streams within the Cerrado biome of Brazil (Ribeiro
and Walter, 1998). The plant species composition, diversity, and structural
characteristics of these forests have been extensively documented (Felfili 1994,
Felfili 1995, Nóbrega et al. 2001, Silva Júnior 2004, Silva
Júnior 2005, Moretti et al. 2013, Cabacinha & Fontes 2014,
Pio 2018), and they are generally characterized by high biological
diversity. One potential explanation for this diversity is the heterogeneity
of soil types present in these areas, which include both
well-drained and poorly drained soils (Haridasan 1998). For instance, gallery
forests may occur on oxisols (latossolos) and histosols (organossolos) (Resck
& Silva 1998). These soil types exhibit distinct hydrological properties,
which not only influence plant community composition but are also
likely to affect the ecosystem service functions of riparian buffer
zones. For example, riparian forests established on histosols may be
less effective at reducing surface runoff from upland areas during
the wet season, as these soils tend to become saturated
and contribute to runoff generation (Dunne & Black 1970a,b). Therefore,
it is important to investigate the hydrological functions of gallery
forests in relation to different soil types.
