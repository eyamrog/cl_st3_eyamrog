Brussevich et al. (2020) analyzed the feasibility of working from
home in OECD countries. Their findings indicate that the pandemic
may exacerbate inequality, as workers who are least likely to
be able to work remotely are typically younger, have lower
levels of education, hold atypical contracts, are employed by smaller
companies, or are situated at the lower end of the
income distribution.
