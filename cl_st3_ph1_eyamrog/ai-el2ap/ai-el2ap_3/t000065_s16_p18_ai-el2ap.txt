The studies conducted with our learner corpus thus far demonstrate
the extent to which targeted corpus analysis can enhance the
understanding of learners’ linguistic needs, taking into account the register
in which they wrote, their proficiency level, and the types
of tasks performed. The overarching objective of such research is
to address learners’ specific difficulties, thereby enabling the development of
more precisely tailored activities and the potential redesign of course
syllabi. An illustrative example of integrating interlanguage analysis with classroom
activities is provided by Alves and Pinto (2018). In their
study, the reporting of results and conclusions in abstracts was
examined using two apprentice corpora: CorIFA and MICUSP. The analysis
of CorIFA offered authentic examples of learner language, while access
to MICUSP facilitated a corpus linguistics pedagogical approach known as
Do-it-Yourself (DIY) corpora (McEnery et al., 2006). Students compiled their
own study corpus, which increased their awareness of strategies to
improve subsequent drafts of their abstracts. MICUSP was particularly suitable
for DIY activities because it comprises well-evaluated university papers, and
its online platform allows users to select discipline-specific texts.
