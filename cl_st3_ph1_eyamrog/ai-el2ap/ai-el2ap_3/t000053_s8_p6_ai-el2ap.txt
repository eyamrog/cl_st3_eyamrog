Phlebotominae sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae) are of significant medical importance
due to their role as vectors of diseases such as
leishmaniases, bartonellosis, and certain arboviruses [1]. In the Americas, 547
sand fly species have been documented, with the majority occurring
in tropical regions; the Amazon region, in particular, exhibits the
highest diversity and species richness of these insects [2, 3].
Within this region, the state of Acre demonstrates substantial phlebotomine
species richness, as evidenced by recent reports of new species
records and descriptions [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
