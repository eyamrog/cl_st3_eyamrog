The metabolites derived from Lophophora williamsii, similar to those found
in many other cacti, represent a potential resource that remains
largely underutilized in the pharmaceutical industry (Das et al., 2020).
Unlike ayahuasca, these metabolites have not generated comparable commercial interest,
which may be attributable to the legal controversies associated with
ayahuasca.
