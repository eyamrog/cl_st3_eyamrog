Identification. This species is distinguished by its small receptacle, typically
measuring 5 cm or less in diameter, although some specimens
may reach up to 15 cm. The receptacle is globose
to subglobose in shape and exhibits a reddish coloration. The
surface displays relatively regular meshes, which are generally round at
the apex and become more elongated toward the base. A
corrugated and folded membrane surrounds the meshes, and this membrane
contains the gleba (Dring 1980).
