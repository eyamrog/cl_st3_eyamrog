Although the weighting matrices (queen, rook, and k-nearest neighbors) yield
different results, their deviations from the aggregate outcome are smaller
compared to the distance-based weighting matrix. In identifying SBD candidates
in the city of SÃ£o Paulo, only those areas that
are statistically significant across all specifications and classified as HH
or HL clusters are considered. At a significance level of
at least 5%, 37 census tracts are identified as SBD
candidates, all of which are classified exclusively as HH clusters,
as shown in Table 3. Among the three spatial weighting
matrix specifications (queen, rook, and k-nearest neighbors), only one area
is not significant under both the rook and queen specifications.
Consequently, 36 areas are ultimately considered as SBD candidates.
