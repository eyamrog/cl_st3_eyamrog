One of the text variables included in CorIFA is length
in words. Instructors of Italian as a Foreign Language (IFA)
may establish appropriate word count ranges for texts based on
their assessment of studentsâ€™ proficiency levels and the specific characteristics
of each register. The average word length is maintained as
indicated in Table 2, which also provides the total number
of words for each register as well as for the
entire corpus.
