These differences have the following practical implications: from the Keynesian
perspective, capital controls should be regarded as a permanent instrument
of economic policy, given that currency inconvertibility may persist for
an indeterminate period. In contrast, from the mainstream orthodox perspective,
capital controls and macroprudential policies should be employed only on
a temporary basis, specifically in response to surges in capital
inflows that could increase financial risks and lead to exchange
rate overvaluation.
