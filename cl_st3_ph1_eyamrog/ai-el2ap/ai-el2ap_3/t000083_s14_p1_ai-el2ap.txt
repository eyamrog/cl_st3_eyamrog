Data were collected in two stages. Initially, a pilot sample
of 45 adolescents (mean age = 16 years, SD =
2) was recruited to participate in the online study through
social media and WhatsApp contacts. Following approval from the Research
Ethics Committee of the Federal University of São Paulo (No.
4.526.802), the authors developed an online survey using Google Forms.
The survey began with information outlining the study’s purpose and
requirements, followed by an informed consent form; only participants who
provided informed consent were able to proceed with the survey.
Eligibility criteria included being between 12 and 18 years of
age and having an account on at least one social
network. Both the pilot (n = 45) and final (n
= 261) versions of the study were conducted in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki, which outlines ethical principles for
medical research involving human subjects.
