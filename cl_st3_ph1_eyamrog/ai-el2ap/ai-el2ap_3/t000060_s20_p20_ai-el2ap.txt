In Excerpt 4, the formulation "tell us what happened generally
about what happened at the executive director banquet" demonstrates a
shift in the semantic framework, as the original question "tell
us what happened at this executive director banquet?" does not
explicitly request a general response. Ms. Willmott subsequently reformulates her
question to incorporate this broader perspective, introducing information that had
not been previously requested but was assumed by the interlocutors.
This example illustrates the distinct conventions governing courtroom questioning, which
differ from those of ordinary conversation, where Ariasâ€™ response would
likely have attracted no particular attention. As Roca-Cuberes (2014, pp.
310-313) notes, institutional talk can be analyzed across various settings.
