Convergent validity assesses whether the items within a scale, or
within a specific dimension of a multidimensional scale, are representative
of a single underlying construct (Graver and Mentzer, 1999). In
partial least squares (PLS) modeling, convergent validity is evaluated using
the average variance extracted (AVE), which quantifies the proportion of
variance captured by each construct relative to the variance attributable
to measurement error. In the present study, all AVE values
exceeded 0.79 (environmental enhancement = 0.81; social competition = 0.79;
attention seeking = 0.83; mood and confidence = 0.85; subjective
conformity = 0.79), thereby supporting the convergent validity of the
scale in accordance with established criteria (Fornell and Larcker, 1981;
Sanches-Franco and Roldan, 2005; Balakrishnan and Griffiths, 2017) (see Table
1).
