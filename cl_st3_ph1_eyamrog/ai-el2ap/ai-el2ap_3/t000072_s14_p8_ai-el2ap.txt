The seedling emergence method described by Simpson et al. (1989)
was employed for seed bank analysis, with monitoring conducted every
15 days over a six-month period. To facilitate accurate identification,
individuals exhibiting shrub or tree characteristics were transplanted into tubes
for further development. Seedling identification was performed using species identification
guides, including Lorenzi (2014) and Brancalion and Nogueira (2016). Voucher
specimens of the identified seedlings were prepared and deposited in
the herbarium of the Universidade Federal de SÃ£o Carlos, Araras
Campus.
