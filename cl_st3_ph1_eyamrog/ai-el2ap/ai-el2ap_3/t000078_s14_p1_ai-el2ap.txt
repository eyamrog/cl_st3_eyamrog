The identification of SBD candidate areas is based on the
Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) technique, which involves an initial
estimation strategy. This approach enables the calculation of both global
and local measures of spatial autocorrelation. The Global Moran’s I
statistic is used to assess the overall spatial association pattern
of employment, weighted by area, across the entire sample. In
contrast, the Local Moran’s I statistic allows for the decomposition
of spatial association into specific regimes, identifying clusters classified as
high-high (HH), high-low (HL), low-high (LH), and low-low (LL). This
is achieved by computing an individual Moran’s I value for
each observation in the sample, denoted as 𝐼𝑖, where 𝑖
represents the region under evaluation and 𝑖 = 1, …,
𝐼 (Anselin, 1995). Algebraically, 𝐼𝑖 is defined as <>, where
𝑧𝑖 is the employment deviation for Census tract 𝑖, 𝑊𝑧𝑖
is the average employment deviation in the neighboring tracts of
𝑖, and 𝜎² is the variance of the deviations. Statistical
inference is conducted using a random permutation method.
