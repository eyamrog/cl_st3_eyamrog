Identification. This species is primarily distinguished by its arched basidiomata,
dark brown and asperulate endoperidium, a mycelial layer covered with
abundant debris, a fibrillose peristome, a relatively large pedicel reaching
up to 4 mm in height, and basidiospores bearing prominent
truncate warts (Sunhede 1989; Soto & Wright 2000; Alves &
Cortez 2016).
