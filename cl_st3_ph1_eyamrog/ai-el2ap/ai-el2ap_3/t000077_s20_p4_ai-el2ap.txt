Additionally, when the proportion of remote work exceeded 40%, the
participants included pedagogues and other teachers (such as those specializing
in languages, arts, and music), as well as professionals with
higher education, including lawyers, engineers, accountants, and journalists. These occupational
categories align with the general "sector" characterized by a high
number of remote work hours, as defined by Gaudecker et
al. (2020), which predominantly consists of individuals with higher education
engaged in office-based occupations.
