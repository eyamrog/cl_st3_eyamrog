As noted by Paiva (2016), informal written language is increasingly
characterized by multimodality. Paiva’s analysis of emojis in social media
suggests that their use represents an effort to convey meaning
efficiently in certain communicative contexts. The development of emojis, particularly
in conjunction with mobile applications and integrated emoji keyboards, has
significantly influenced communication practices on platforms such as Twitter, WhatsApp,
Instagram, and Facebook. An expanding body of research is dedicated
to examining the functions and interpretations of emojis across various
digital communication modes. Studies indicate that although many emojis appear
visually similar, their meanings and interpretations are shaped by users’
cultural backgrounds, gender differences, and the specific visual features of
the emojis themselves, thereby contributing to a distinct communicative system
(Bai, Dan, Mu, & Yang, 2019). Fullwood, Orchard, and Floyd
(2013) investigated emoji use in Internet chat rooms and found
that individuals across all age groups employ emoticons to express
emotions. Their research also identified gender-based differences, with female participants
more frequently using expressive emoticons and being more likely to
employ them during direct interactions compared to male participants.
