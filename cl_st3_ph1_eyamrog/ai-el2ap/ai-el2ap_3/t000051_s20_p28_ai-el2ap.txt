A latent discourse of free democracy is present, as indicated
by the statement “wir wissen um die Stärke freier Demokratien,”
which serves to establish a sense of unity among the
audience. This discourse is linked to the characterization of the
conflict in Ukraine by framing the attack as not only
targeting Ukraine but also as an assault on the peaceful
order in Europe and globally, and by explicitly referring to
the conflict as “Putin’s war.” The concluding sentence, which asserts
“wir werden es verteidigen” (“we will defend it”), further reinforces
the discourse positioning Germany as a military power.
