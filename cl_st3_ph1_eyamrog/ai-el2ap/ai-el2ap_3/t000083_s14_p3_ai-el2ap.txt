After formally obtaining permission from the authors who developed the
SBS (Balakrishnan & Griffiths, 2017), we employed the cross-cultural adaptation
method proposed by Brislin (1970, 1973, 1980, 1986), which consists
of four stages: translation and adaptation, assessment of semantic equivalence,
pilot testing, and back-translation. Additionally, we adopted the universalist approach
to cross-cultural adaptation of instruments as outlined by Herdman et
al. (1997, 1998), which is widely regarded as appropriate for
ensuring conceptual and item equivalence. This approach involves a comprehensive
literature review to evaluate the underlying concepts of the original
scale and their relevance to the Brazilian context, as well
as assessments of semantic equivalence (the ability of the scale
to preserve the original concepts) and operational equivalence (which addresses
practical aspects of questionnaire administration, such as question format—online or
paper—and mode of completion—self-administered or interviewer-administered).
