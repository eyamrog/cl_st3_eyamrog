Fish DNA was isolated following the protocol described by Aljanabi
and Martinez (1997). Approximately 50 μg of pectoral fin tissue
was cut into small pieces and digested overnight at 55
°C with 20 μl of proteinase K (20 mg/ml) in
180 μl of extraction buffer (1 M Tris, 0.5 M
NaCl2, 1% SDS). The extracted DNA was resuspended in 150
μl of sterile double-distilled water and stored at −20 °C
until PCR amplification (Louizi et al., 2019). The partial mitochondrial
Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI) gene was amplified using the universal
primers FishF1/F2 and FishR1 (Ward et al., 2005). Each PCR
reaction was performed in a 50 μl volume containing 0.25
mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 1 μM of
each primer, 5 μl of 10× buffer, and 10 units
of Taq polymerase. The thermal cycling conditions consisted of an
initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by
30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 48 °C
for 30 s, and 72 °C for 5 min, with
a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min (Louizi
et al., 2019). Sequencing was conducted at the genotyping-sequencing platform
of the Institut des Sciences de l'Evolution de Montpellier (ISE-M),
France, using a Genomix sequencer (MGX) according to the manufacturer's
instructions and employing the same primers as for PCR. Sequence
cleaning and alignment were performed using MEGA X software (Kumar
et al., 2018). Voucher specimens (Fig. 2) were deposited in
the collection of CRH-Uvira (DRC).
