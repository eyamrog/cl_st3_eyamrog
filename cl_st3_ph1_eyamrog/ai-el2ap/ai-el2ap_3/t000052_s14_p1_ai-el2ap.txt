The parasites examined in this study were collected from 11
specimens of Auchenoglanis occidentalis (Claroteidae, Siluriformes). The fish were captured
in the northwestern region of the lake, specifically a few
meters from the Orthodox Church in Uvira (northern area) and
at the mouth of the River Mutambala (southern area) (Fig.
1). The specimens were euthanized by severing their chordal spines
and were identified on site as Auchenoglanis occidentalis using the
identification keys provided by Fermon et al. (2012). The gills
and a small section of the pectoral fins were preserved
in 96% ethanol for further analysis.
