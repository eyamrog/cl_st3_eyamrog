In 2014, another attempt was made to collect student texts
and compile a learner corpus. Since the primary objective of
having students produce texts was pedagogical, many decisions regarding the
writing process were made by subject teachers, resulting in most
essays being handwritten. The substantial time and effort required to
convert these handwritten texts into digital format led the research
group to exclude the 2014 texts from CorIFA. The group
determined that, despite providing transcriber training, there remained a risk
that spelling or grammatical errors could be inadvertently corrected by
transcribers or by computer spell checkers, thereby producing texts that
would not accurately represent the studentsâ€™ actual proficiency in English.
As the experience of processing paper-based texts proved inefficient for
corpus compilation, from 2015 onwards, all texts have been collected
exclusively in digital format, with students submitting their work through
an online form.
