In both the control group and the garden group, the
external periclinal cell wall and cuticle were not distinguishable from
each other (figures 6a, b, f), and are therefore collectively
referred to as the outer layer of epidermal cells in
this study. This outer layer was substantially thicker in plants
exposed to abundant sunlight (figures 6a–c) compared to those grown
under other conditions (figures 6d–e). Plants cultivated in the greenhouse
exhibited an intermediate thickness of the epidermal layer (figure 6e).
