This chapter examines predatory practices in scholarly communication from the
perspective of a research team involved in the development of
journal publishing platforms and the study of open science. We
analyze a sample of 521 journals that utilize our platform
and are also listed on one or both of two
prominent lists identifying potentially predatory journals. The first list, compiled
by Jeffrey Beall, a librarian at the University of Colorado
Denver, included 30,968 journals from “potential, possible, or probable predatory
scholarly open-access publishers” until its discontinuation in 2017 (Beall’s list,
n.d.). The second, Cabells Predatory Reports, has catalogued 15,470 titles
since 2017 as a “database of journals [which] our specialists
have flagged as probable threats” (Cabells, n.d.). Journals and publishers
appearing on these lists are generally considered to exploit researchers
by soliciting article processing charges (APCs) for publication in journals
that may not adhere to established scholarly standards, such as
rigorous peer review. However, we use the term “presumed to
prey” to reflect the inherent difficulty in verifying whether a
journal meets such standards, as neither Beall, Cabells, nor other
evaluators typically have access to the internal editorial processes of
these journals. This difficulty is partly attributable to the historical
development of scholarly journals, which often originated within scholarly societies
or groups of trusted colleagues, where editorial transparency was assumed
based on the reputation of individuals listed on the masthead
(Csiszar, 2020). The expansion of research dissemination through the internet
and open access has increased the scale and diversity of
scholarly publishing, creating opportunities for deceptive practices that exploit traditional
norms of trust. In the absence of direct evidence regarding
editorial practices, Beall and Cabells rely on indirect indicators of
potential threats to scholarly integrity, such as unprofessional website design,
incomplete or misleading mastheads, exaggerated claims, and unsolicited email solicitations.
