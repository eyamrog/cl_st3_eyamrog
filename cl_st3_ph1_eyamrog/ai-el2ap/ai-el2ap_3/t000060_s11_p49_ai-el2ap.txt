Facework is defined as the set of actions individuals undertake
to prevent themselves or others from experiencing a loss of
face. In contrast to politeness, facework encompasses practices intended to
establish, enhance, threaten, or diminish the interlocutor’s social image. Politeness
specifically refers to behaviors that address individuals’ needs for approval
and autonomy. Building on Goffman’s (1974) original concept of face,
Brown and Levinson (1987) further developed the theory of politeness
by distinguishing between two aspects of socially constructed self-image: negative
face and positive face.
