Given the documented correlation between water quality and helminth infections
in fish species such as Cyprinids (Zargar et al. 2012),
the observed overdispersion of Bagrobdella vanhovei and the absence of
B. vansteenbergei in the six host individuals collected near the
Orthodox Church of Uvira may be attributable to differences in
water quality between the two sampling sites. It is therefore
possible that Bagrobdella vansteenbergei is specifically adapted to the environmental
conditions present at the Mouth of the Mutambala River, whereas
Bagrobdella vanhovei may exhibit greater tolerance to variations in abiotic
factors.
