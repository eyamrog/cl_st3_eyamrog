In the cheating component Sai, selection favors trait matching for
the cheater species j, as described in equation 1, while
it favors trait mismatch for the victim species i, which
is the species targeted by the cheater. Similar to the
mutualism component, the magnitude of trait change in the model
is determined by the evolutionary effect of species j on
species i, denoted as vij(t). The selection for trait mismatch
between the cheater and the victim is governed by the
parameter 𝜀𝑖𝑗.
