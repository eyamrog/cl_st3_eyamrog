Specialized business districts (SBDs) increase competition for land among households
and firms (Wheaton, 2004). As a result, low-income households are
often displaced from newly developed business areas to the urban
periphery due to rising rent prices. This displacement leads to
increased demand for public transportation from peripheral areas to the
city center, thereby altering the traditional concentric transportation pattern characteristic
of monocentric cities. Consequently, commuting patterns become less predictable, as
cross-commuting emerges as a viable option for households. Workersâ€™ location
decisions are influenced not only by the desire to minimize
commuting costs but also by the spatial distribution of employment
opportunities that match their skills. As a result, workers cannot
be assured of minimizing their commuting distances.
