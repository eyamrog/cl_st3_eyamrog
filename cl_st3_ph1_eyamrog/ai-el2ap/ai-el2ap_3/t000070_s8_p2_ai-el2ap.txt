Given the ecological significance and high levels of endemism among
bromeliads, it is fundamentally important to develop conservation strategies that
maintain genetic diversity within these species (Costa et al. 2014,
BFG 2015). However, current information regarding ex situ conservation practices
for bromeliad species in Brazil remains limited, highlighting the necessity
for the implementation of effective programs aimed at preserving native
plant diversity (Rodrigues et al. 2014).
