Finally, we compared the coevolutionary dynamics of the Central scenario
with those of a scenario in which cheating interactions were
randomly distributed across the network (the Random scenario). To construct
the Random scenario, we calculated the frequency of negative effects
in the networks (fCh) observed in the Central scenario, as
defined in Equation 10, and used this frequency as the
probability (p) for assigning cheating interactions in the Random scenario
networks. In this context, n(-+) represents the number of cheating
interactions, while n(++) denotes the number of mutualistic interactions within
the network.
