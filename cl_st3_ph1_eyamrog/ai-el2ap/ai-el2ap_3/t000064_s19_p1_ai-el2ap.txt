Physiological parameters and light response curves—The physiological parameters measured are
summarized in Table 1, and Figures 1 to 4 present
the light response curves of CO₂ assimilation. In both the
control group and the plants cultivated in the garden, leaves
reached approximately 90% of their maximum carbon assimilation rate at
a light intensity of 900 µmol m⁻² s⁻¹. As the
majority of leaves exhibited peak carbon assimilation at this intensity,
it was designated as the light saturation point. At light
intensities exceeding twice this value, the carbon assimilation rate remained
stable, indicating an absence of photoinhibition (Figures 1, 2, 4).
In the open groups (wild plants and garden plants), the
carbon assimilation rates under natural sunlight (photosynthetically active radiation [PAR]
of approximately 2,000 µmol m⁻² s⁻¹) were equivalent to the
maximum rates measured by the infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) at
a maximal PAR of 1,600 µmol m⁻² s⁻¹; therefore, the
Amax data were combined for analysis.
