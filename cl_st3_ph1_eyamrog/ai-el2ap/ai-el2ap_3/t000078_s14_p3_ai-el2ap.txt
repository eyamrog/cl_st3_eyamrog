A general hedonic model for house \(i\) in year \(t\)
is specified as follows: <>, where \(P_{it}\) denotes the price
of house \(i\) in year \(t\), \(CBD_i\) represents the distance
from the city center, \(SBD_{p,i}\) are the distances from house
\(i\) to each sub-business district (SBD) candidate identified in the
initial stage, \(Z_{it}\) comprises the intrinsic characteristics of house \(i\)
in year \(t\), \(A_i\) is the vector of distances from
house \(i\) to each of the \(l\) amenities, \(T_i\) denotes
the distances from house \(i\) to each of the \(m\)
avenues and transportation modes, \(D\) is a vector of time
dummy variables, \(\varepsilon_{it}\) is the spatially autocorrelated error term, and
\(u_{it}\) is the random error term. Spatial lags are constructed
using \(w_{ij}\), the neighborhood spatial matrix, subject to the following
conditions: (a) \(w_{ij} = 0\) for \(j = i\); (b)
\(0 < w_{ij} \leq 1\) if \(j\) is a neighbor
of \(i\); and (c) <>, which is generally set to
one. Accordingly, \(w_{ij}P_{it}\) represents the spatial lag of house prices,
and \(w_{ij}X_{m,i}\) denotes the spatial lag of covariates (\(Z_{kit}\), \(A_{li}\),
\(T_{mi}\)). The coefficients to be estimated in the model are
\(\alpha\), \(\rho\), \(\theta\), \(\tau_p\), \(\gamma_k\), \(\beta_l\), \(\kappa_o\), \(\mu\), \(\lambda\), and
\(\sigma_u\).
