Host species identification was confirmed through molecular analysis, and the
resulting sequences were deposited in GenBank (Identification number XXX). The
gills of eleven Auchenoglanis occidentalis specimens were examined for parasite
infection, with seven individuals found to be parasitized. The highest
parasite load was observed in the single specimen collected at
the mouth of the Mutambala River.
