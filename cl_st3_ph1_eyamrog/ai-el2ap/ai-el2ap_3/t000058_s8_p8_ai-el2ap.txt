Given the significance of culicids in various fields of natural
and applied sciences, as well as the role of biological
collections in conserving biodiversity data, it is essential that all
available information on these insects be published, shared, and made
accessible to both the general public and the scientific community.
The data collection and cataloguing of the Ana Leuch Lozovei
Entomological Collection at ColPar/DPAT/BL/UFPR have resulted in a comprehensive repository
of information on the culicid fauna from selected phytogeographic regions
in the state of Paran√°. This collection provides valuable data
for understanding the entomofauna of areas that were previously undisturbed
and for identifying species that are currently rare or difficult
to collect in the state, thereby supporting future research on
fauna and environmental conservation. The subfamily Culicinae constitutes the majority
of the species in the collection, with the genus Culex
accounting for approximately 40% of the total specimens, distributed among
52 species, making it the most diverse genus represented. In
contrast, the genera Aedeomyia, Lutzia, Onirion, and Shannoniana are minimally
represented, each with only one species. Within the subfamily Anophelinae,
two genera are recorded: Anopheles, with 30 species, and Chagasia,
with one species. The 30-year duration of this study provides
a substantial temporal framework for analyzing population dynamics and detecting
previously unrecorded species, thereby facilitating the generation of data relevant
to areas with epidemiological potential for culicid-related diseases [22].
