Research indicates that participants in formal settings such as courtrooms,
classrooms, and news interviews systematically organize their behavior to reflect
and reinforce the institutional character of the interaction (Drew and
Heritage, 1992, p. 26). Additionally, their actions are subject to
a reduced range of options and possibilities compared to those
available in ordinary conversation. In examining the use of formulations,
Drew (2003) observes that such practices are infrequently found in
everyday conversation. He attributes this to the absence of a
need for compromise following extended negotiation in routine interactions (Drew,
2003, p. 306).
