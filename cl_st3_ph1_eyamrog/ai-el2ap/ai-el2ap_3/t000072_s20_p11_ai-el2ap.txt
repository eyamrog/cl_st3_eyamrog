Among all the species identified in this study, 55% exhibit
zoochoric dispersal syndromes, 30% anemochoric, and 12.5% autochoric. Zoochory plays
a significant role in maintaining interactions between fauna and flora,
thereby contributing to the conservation and ecological functionality of forest
fragments (Garc√≠a et al. 2011). In general, zoochoric dispersal is
predominant in well-preserved fragments and large areas of tropical forest
(Sansevero et al. 2011; Jesus et al. 2012). Given that
the study area is a fragment with minimal anthropogenic disturbance,
the high proportion of zoochoric species suggests a relatively good
state of conservation. Similar results have been reported in other
studies of semideciduous forest remnants, where more than half of
the sampled individuals rely on animal-mediated dispersal (Silva et al.
2019; Neto et al. 2020).
