This approach to the workshop takes into account the multimodal
resources available on ZOOM, including audio, video, and written text
in the chat, which facilitate various forms of participant interaction.
Drawing on Vygotsky (2004), intentionality is consistently required of the
facilitator in a collaborative learning environment, as the facilitator is
responsible for organizing and utilizing available resources to promote participation.
In this session, for instance, the primary forms of participation
planned by the facilitators—who were the professors organizing the workshop—were
play and talk.
