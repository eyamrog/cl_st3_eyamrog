The quantification of total soluble carbohydrate content (mg g⁻¹) was
performed on 200 mg seed samples from each treatment, as
previously described, using the phenol-sulfuric acid method (Dubois et al.,
1956). Samples were prepared in triplicate, macerated with liquid nitrogen,
and transferred to 15 mL test tubes. Subsequently, 0.4 mL
of 80% ethanol (at -22 °C) was added, and the
mixture was incubated in a water bath at 70 °C
for 5 minutes. The extracts were then centrifuged at 3,000
rpm for 10 minutes, and the supernatants were collected. This
extraction process was repeated three times, followed by filtration through
glass wool, and the final volume was adjusted to 2
mL with 80% ethanol (at -22 °C). For the colorimetric
assay, 50 μL of the extract was mixed with 450
μL of distilled water, 0.5 mL of 5% phenol, and
2.5 mL of 96% sulfuric acid. The total carbohydrate concentration
was determined using a standard curve generated with glucose, and
absorbance was measured at 490 nm using a Pro-Analysis V-1600
spectrophotometer.
