The analysis of fruit collection at different intervals, measured in
days after anthesis (DAA), indicated statistically significant differences in seed
water content (Table 1). The highest mean water percentage (17.6%,
p < 0.05) was observed in seeds collected at 120
DAA. No statistically significant differences in moisture content were detected
between seeds collected at 135 and 150 DAA.
