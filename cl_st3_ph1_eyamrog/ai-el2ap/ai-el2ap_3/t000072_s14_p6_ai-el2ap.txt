The sampling method employed in the 10 plots was adapted
from Braga et al. (2016) and involved collecting four samples
per plot using a 25 cm x 25 cm template.
Sampling was conducted in September 2018, during the transition from
the dry season to the rainy season, as this period
has been shown to yield greater species diversity in seed
bank analyses (Braga et al. 2016).
