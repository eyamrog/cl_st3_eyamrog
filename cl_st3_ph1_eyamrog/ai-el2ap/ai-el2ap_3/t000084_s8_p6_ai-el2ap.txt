Garrison, Anderson, and Archerâ€™s (1999) Community of Inquiry (CoI) Model
is widely regarded as a foundational framework for evaluating the
quality of online learning. The model was developed to identify
essential components for effective text-based communication in online courses, positing
that learning is facilitated through the interaction of three core
elements: social presence, cognitive presence, and teaching presence. While the
original study acknowledged the use of emoticons in forum interactions,
further investigation into the role of emerging languages in educational
experiences, particularly via mobile devices, may enhance current understandings of
online communication. Subsequent research has continued to apply the CoI
model to analyze various forms of communication in online learning
environments (Micsky & Foels, 2019; Rath, 2012).
