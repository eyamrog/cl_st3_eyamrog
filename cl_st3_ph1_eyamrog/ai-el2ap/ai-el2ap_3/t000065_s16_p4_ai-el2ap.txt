In 2015, a compilation of texts was initiated, incorporating samples
produced under both controlled and uncontrolled time conditions. Initially, students
submitted texts as part of in-class mock tests designed to
assess their writing abilities under time constraints and in response
to a specified topic. Three mock tests were administered to
B1 and B2 level students, all of which included identical
instructions for text production. Students were required to write a
minimum 300-word essay on a given topic within 30 minutes.
The successful implementation of digital text collection led to the
standardization of the compilation process. From 2016 onwards, students have
submitted texts in various registers via online forms, according to
their proficiency levels, as detailed in Table 1. The systematic
approach to corpus compilation has enabled the research group to
maintain a robust learner corpus, which will be described in
the following section. Prior to submitting their texts, learners are
required to complete a digital form via Google Forms, providing
personal information and reading a consent form regarding their participation
in the research, to which they may agree or decline.
This form collects data that facilitates more accurate documentation of
participantsâ€™ social and linguistic backgrounds, as well as task-specific details.
The consent form is included in the Appendix.
