The term "hedge," as used in this research, follows the
definition provided by Brown and Levinson (1987, p. 145), who
describe it as "the particle, word or phrase that modifies
the degree of membership of a predicate or noun phrase
in the set; it says of membership that it is
partial, or true only in certain respects, or that it
is more true and complete than might be expected." Additionally,
the phrase "why don’t you just restate the question that
you technically asked her" exemplifies another mitigation device. This construction
reduces the directness of the imperative verb "restate," thereby increasing
the politeness of the request and contributing to the protection
of the speaker’s positive face.
