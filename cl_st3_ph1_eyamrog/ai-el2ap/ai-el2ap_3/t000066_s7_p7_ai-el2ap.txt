Drawing on the workshop, this paper examines theoretical and practical
concepts central to the GPB, specifically collaboration and play, which
are also fundamental to the session under analysis. Collaboration, as
defined within the framework of Critical Collaborative Research (Magalh√£es &
Fidalgo, 2019), emphasizes co-authorship and the joint construction of knowledge
among all participants engaged in an activity. In the context
of the play session, participants engaged in collaborative practices by
sharing their experiences, interacting with available resources, and recognizing the
significance of group diversity as a factor contributing to collective
development.
