Objective: To describe authorship concentration indexes, specifically the proportion of
articles published by the most prolific author (PPMP) and the
Gini coefficient, among health sciences journals indexed in LILACS, and
to compare these metrics with those reported in a previous
study of journals indexed in MEDLINE.
