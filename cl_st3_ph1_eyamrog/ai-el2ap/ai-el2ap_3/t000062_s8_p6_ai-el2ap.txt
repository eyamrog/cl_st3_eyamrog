This study investigates the effect of H. coronarium on the
assemblage of soil spiders in the Parque Estadual das Fontes
do Ipiranga (PEFI). It was hypothesized that H. coronarium would
influence spider abundance due to its formation of monospecific populations,
similar to the effects observed for V. minor as reported
by Bultman and De-Witt (2008). The relevance of studying spider
diversity in this area is heightened by ongoing disturbances, including
frequent soil removal and regular passage of vehicles and research
groups. The findings contribute to a better understanding of ecological
interactions between spiders and plants and underscore the need for
careful consideration regarding the introduction of non-native species in conservation
units.
