Methods: Bibliographic data were obtained from LILACS for systematically indexed
journals that published at least 50 signed articles (i.e., articles
with at least one identifiable individual author) between 2015 and
2019. Authors were identified by name or, when available, by
ORCID identifier. The PPMP was calculated as the number of
articles authored by the journalâ€™s most prolific author divided by
the total number of signed articles in the journal. The
Gini coefficient was computed such that articles with multiple authors
were counted for each contributing author. For comparative analysis, MEDLINE
data were reweighted to match the distribution of journal sizes
(measured by the number of signed articles) observed in the
LILACS dataset.
