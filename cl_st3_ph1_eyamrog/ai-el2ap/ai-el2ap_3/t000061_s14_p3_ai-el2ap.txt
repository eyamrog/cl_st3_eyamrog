The objective of this phase of the research was to
obtain responses from USR scholarship recipients enrolled in Graduate Programs
in Education (PPG/Edu) that received ratings of 6 or 7
from the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel
(Capes). In October 2019, the USR directorates of the universities
hosting the three PPGs that met these criteria and were
located in the South Region were contacted via email. Of
the three USR directorates contacted, two agreed to distribute the
questionnaire link to their students engaged in USR activities, while
the third did not respond to the request.
