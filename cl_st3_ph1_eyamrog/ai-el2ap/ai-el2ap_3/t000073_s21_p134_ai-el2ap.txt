Identification. The species can be identified by the fertile portion
of the receptacle, which forms an irregular, reddish net that
encloses the stipe and extends beyond its width. The stipe
is also reddish, slender, and its length is clearly greater
than its width; it is not striate (Hern√°ndez-Caffot et al.
2018).
