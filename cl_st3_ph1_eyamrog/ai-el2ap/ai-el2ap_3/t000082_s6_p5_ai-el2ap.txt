Third, the presence of cheating species in mutualistic networks may
result in the reorganization of network structure due to increased
trait dissimilarity. Our findings indicate that cheating is associated with
increased modularity and decreased nestedness in mutualistic networks. The development
of modularity has also been observed as a consequence of
coevolutionary dynamics in antagonistic networks and is influenced by the
selection intensity between victim and cheater species (Andreazzi et al.
2017). Our results suggest an alternative mechanism for the emergence
of modularity in mutualistic networks, which is determined by the
extent to which these networks accommodate cheating interactions. The structure
of interaction networks is influenced by multiple factors, including species
abundance distribution (DÃ¡tillo et al. 2014), trait mismatches between plants
and animals (Stang et al. 2007), and phylogenetic and phenological
constraints (Jordano 1995; Jordano et al. 2003). The present study
demonstrates that cheating interactions can also alter the structure of
mutualistic networks through coevolutionary processes. Future research should investigate the
impact of cheating interactions on cascading co-extinctions within mutualistic networks.
