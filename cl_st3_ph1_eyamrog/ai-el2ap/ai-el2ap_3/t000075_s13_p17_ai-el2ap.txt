During the post-global crisis period, when several emerging economies implemented
capital inflow controls, numerous economists investigated the potential effectiveness of
these measures within the context of elevated global liquidity and
concerns that such capital flow management measures (CFMs) could constitute
a new form of ‘impoverish the neighborhood’ policy. Pasricha et
al. (2018) made a significant contribution to the literature on
capital controls and macroprudential policies by utilizing a comprehensive capital
controls database to assess the effectiveness of measures adopted by
emerging economies before and after financial crises, focusing on financial
flows, exchange rate fluctuations, and monetary policy autonomy. The study
employs two models to evaluate both the domestic impacts of
capital controls and the spillover effects resulting from the imposition
of controls by certain BRICS members on other emerging economies.
