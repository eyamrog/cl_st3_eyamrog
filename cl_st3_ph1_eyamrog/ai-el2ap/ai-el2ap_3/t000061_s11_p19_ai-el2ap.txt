In this context, Benjamin (1985) argues that art constitutes a
privileged domain for the realization of authentic experiences. According to
Benjamin, the artist possesses the capacity to generate non-sensible similarities,
identifying connections that are not apparent to others. This concept
is central to Adorno’s Aesthetic Theory, which appears to have
been influenced by his intellectual engagement with Benjamin (Gagnebin, 1993).
Although Adorno acknowledges certain risks associated with mimetic behavior, his
works, particularly Negative Dialectics and Aesthetic Theory, indicate that he
does not reject mimesis outright. Instead, Adorno maintains that an
initial, desirable phase of mimetic engagement with reality should be
complemented by the subject’s rational reflection: “it is neither an
immediate mimesis, nor repressed mimesis, but the process it triggers
and in which it remains modified” (Adorno, 1982, p. 364).
