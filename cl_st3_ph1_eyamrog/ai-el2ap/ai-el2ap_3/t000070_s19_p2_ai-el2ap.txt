The average percentage of seed germination did not show any
statistically significant difference between the conservation methods, with cryopreserved seeds
exhibiting a germination rate of 78.9% and non-cryopreserved seeds 78.3%
(Table 1). However, significant differences in germination percentages were observed
among seeds collected at different days after anthesis (DAA). The
highest and most significant average germination percentage (89.6%, p <
0.01) was recorded for seeds collected at 150 DAA (Table
1).
