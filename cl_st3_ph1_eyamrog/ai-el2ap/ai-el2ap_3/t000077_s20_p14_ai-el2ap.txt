Although relevant, the differences in remote work participation by these
factors are less pronounced than those observed for employment status
and educational attainment. Specifically, remote work participation is 34.58% among
public sector employees compared to 5.15% among the self-employed, and
0.45% among individuals without formal education compared to 34.38% among
those with a college degree. Notably, the most substantial increase
in remote work participation is associated with the attainment of
higher education.
