In conclusion, comparing the responses of wild and in vitro
plants is valuable for refining propagation protocols. The data presented
in this study may inform adjustments to photosynthetically active radiation
(PAR) intensity to promote the development of more mature seedlings,
potentially increasing survival rates during the transition from in vitro
to greenhouse conditions. The development of effective technologies for producing
seedlings of Cerrado species remains a complex but essential process
for their conservation and domestication.
