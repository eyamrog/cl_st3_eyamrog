According to Benjamin (1994), the tendency to perceive only previously
recognized similarities in objects leads to a diminished quality of
experience. In "On the Program of the Coming Philosophy" (Benjamin,
2001), he outlines his intention to develop a concept of
experience that encompasses what he terms the "experience of thought."
Benjamin characterizes experience as being shaped less by isolated, consciously
memorized data and more by accumulated, often unconscious information that
enters memory (Benjamin, 1994, p. 103). In "Doctrine of the
Similarities," a text focused specifically on mimesis, Benjamin reiterates this
perspective.
