A new body of theoretical literature has emerged within the
mainstream that supports the relevance of capital controls. This literature
addresses the limitations of orthodox models that advocate for complete
capital account liberalization and incorporates empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness
of capital controls and macroprudential policies implemented by various countries
under different conditions. This article contends that these revised orthodox
models are ex-post constructions, as they are informed by empirical
findings on the efficacy of capital controls. This development represents
a significant shift within the mainstream, given the substantial impact
that theoretical modeling has on the formulation of future economic
policies.
