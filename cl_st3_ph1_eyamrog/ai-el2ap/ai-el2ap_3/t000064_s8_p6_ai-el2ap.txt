To optimize the in vitro protocol, it is essential to
understand the physiological characteristics of the wild species and their
seedlings at each developmental stage (Kaur 2015). Among these characteristics,
leaf photosynthetic response curves are particularly important, as they provide
information on the capacity of young plants to establish autotrophic
metabolism (Leite et al. 2017).
