The anatomical features correspond to those of Bagrobdella. The total
body length is 681.2 µm (range: 521.7–964.9 µm; n =
72), and the greatest width is 200.4 µm (139.8–273.2 µm;
n = 72). The pharynx measures 70.6 µm (49.4–97 µm;
n = 61). Dorsal anchor measurements are as follows: a
= 81.6 µm (64.7–94.1 µm; n = 78), b =
66.1 µm (52.7–75.9 µm; n = 78), c = 8.9
µm (3.0–17.2 µm; n = 78), d = 20.9 µm
(12.9–29.6 µm; n = 78), e = 18.5 µm (13.3–22.4
µm; n = 78), with no visible filaments. The dorsal
bar has dimensions x = 86.9 µm (62.2–111.6 µm; n
= 72) and w = 14.7 µm (9–22.6 µm; n
= 71), with a median projection oriented posteriorly (Y =
59.4 µm; 33.2–81.9 µm; n = 61). The ventral anchor
is slightly drilled at the beginning of the blade and
measures: a = 65.3 µm (38–73.9 µm; n = 78),
b = 70.9 µm (60.1–79.2 µm; n = 78), c
= 10.5 µm (4.5–16.3 µm; n = 78), d =
17.5 µm (12.6–24.0 µm; n = 78), e = 6.2
µm (3.0–9.1 µm; n = 77), also with no visible
filaments. The ventral bar measures x = 111.9 µm (75.6–146
µm; n = 75) and w = 16.3 µm (9.4–27.4
µm; n = 74), and extends as an outgrowth (BL
= 10.6 µm; 4.6–19.8 µm; n = 60; Bl =
5.8 µm; 3.2–13 µm; n = 60), with a cross-shaped,
posteriorly oriented median projection (Cx = 72.3 µm; 57.8–91.3 µm;
n = 77; Cy = 20.4 µm; 14.3–28.5 µm; n
= 76). At the extremity of the median projection, an
additional sclerotized, trapezoidal piece is attached. Fourteen hooks are present,
arranged in seven symmetrical pairs of varying sizes: pair I
(medio-ventral) is the largest and longest (51.6 µm; 34.3–64.2 µm;
n = 77), pair II (medio-ventral) is the smallest (16.8
µm; 12.9–20 µm; n = 69), pairs III and IV
(latero-dorsal) are nearly identical in size (38.6 µm; 26.6–47.5 µm;
n = 74), and pairs V to VII (latero-ventral) are
also similar in size (25 µm; 16.5–35.4 µm; n =
72). A slightly sclerotized, medium-ventral trapezoidal plate (Fig. 6) is
located between hooks I, measuring TL = 37.3 µm (28.4–49.8
µm; n = 15) and Tl = 27.6 µm (21.7–34.6
µm; n = 16). The male copulatory organ (MCO) is
60.5 µm (50.7–67.3 µm; n = 71), beginning with a
well-developed basal bulb (AL = 15.3 µm; 9.9–22.4 µm; n
= 41; Al = 9.7 µm; 3.4–20.3 µm), followed by
a thick-walled tube of constant diameter, folded at a 30°
angle at the midpoint; the distal half is surrounded by
a membrane, and at the distal extremity, a portion of
the wall forms a triangular part that tapers at the
end, with a length equal to one quarter of the
tube. The eggs are ovoid, slightly arched, and lidded (92.8
µm; 82.7–109.9 µm; n = 12; Fig. 7); at the
pole opposite the operculum, a filament terminates in a small
disc, consistent with the description provided by Euzet and Le
Brun (1990) in the diagnosis of Bagrobdella.
