A reduced, yet unexpected, effect was observed for private sector
workers with a formal contract, who were 0.98 percentage points
less likely to engage in remote work compared to the
reference group of private sector workers without a formal contract.
This negative association emerges when fixed effects for types of
work are included, indicating that the higher probability of remote
work among formal employees is partly attributable to a composition
effect. The existing literature on labor market informality during the
Covid-19 pandemic highlights that informal jobs are generally more vulnerable,
with relatively greater losses occurring in the informal sector (Balde
et al., 2020; Bridi, 2020). Furthermore, the lower likelihood of
remote work among informal workers is attributed to the nature
of tasks predominant in informal employment, which are more likely
to involve physical, manual, and contact-intensive activities (Hatayama et al.,
2020; Garrote Sanchez et al., 2021). After accounting for fixed
effects related to types of work, the results indicate that
holding a formal contract is associated with a slight reduction
in the probability of remote work.
