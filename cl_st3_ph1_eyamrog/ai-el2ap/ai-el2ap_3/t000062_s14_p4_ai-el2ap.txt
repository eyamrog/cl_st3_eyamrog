Data analysis was conducted to assess sampling sufficiency and estimate
potential species richness using the following estimators: Bootstrap, Jackknife 1,
Jackknife 2, Chao 1, Chao 2, and ICE. All calculations
were performed with EstimateS 9.1 (Colwell 2013). Estimator curves were
plotted alongside observed species accumulation curves. For these analyses, all
treatments were pooled, with each sample representing the total number
of spiders collected monthly per treatment. To determine whether significant
differences existed in the number of individuals collected among treatments,
the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality, Levene’s test for homogeneity of
variances, ANOVA, post-hoc Tukey HSD test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and post-hoc
Dunn’s test were applied using R (R Development Core Team
2009); however, non-informative results were not discussed. Additionally, the Simpson
Diversity t-test (significance threshold p < 0.05) was conducted using
Past 2.1 (Hammer et al. 2001), and cluster analysis was
performed based on the Bray-Curtis similarity index and the UPGMA
clustering method.
