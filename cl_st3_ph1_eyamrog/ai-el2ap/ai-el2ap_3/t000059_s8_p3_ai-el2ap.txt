As noted by Scanff et al. (2021), approximately one third
of the journals suspected of endogeneity were published in at
least one language other than English, despite the predominance of
English-language journals in MEDLINE. This predominance suggests that the proposed
95th percentile cutoffs may not be applicable to health sciences
journals published in other languages, which are frequently not indexed
in MEDLINE. Such journals are more likely to be included
in the World Health Organization’s Global Index Medicus, which consists
of five regional bibliographic indexes that primarily target low- and
middle-income countries. The principal regional index among these is the
Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS), which
is maintained by the Pan American Health Organization’s Latin American
and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information (BIREME, based on
its original Portuguese name) (Clark and Castro, 2002).
