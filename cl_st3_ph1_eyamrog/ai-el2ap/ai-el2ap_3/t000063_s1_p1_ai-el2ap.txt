Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists and health
care professionals have provided evidence-based information to the general public,
resulting in increased visibility in both social and mainstream media.
The public observed scientific processes in real time as these
professionals worked to improve understanding and develop diagnostic, treatment, prevention,
and control measures for the novel disease. This study aims
to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescentsâ€™
perceptions of science, scientists, and health care workers; to determine
whether these perceptions influenced their career choices; and to examine
first-year applications and enrollments in scientific and medical fields during
the 2020-2021 academic year in Mexico. A voluntary, national, anonymous
online survey was conducted, and data from the official database
of the National Association of Universities and Higher Education Institutions
in Mexico (ANUIES) were analyzed. Among 983 valid responses (95%
confidence interval), by mid-2021, 90% of respondents aged 14-19 in
Mexico reported a positive perception of science; 69% indicated that
the pandemic improved their perception of science, 70% of scientists,
and 72% of health care workers; and 23% and 28%
reported that their experiences during the pandemic influenced their decision
to pursue science and health care careers, respectively. The most
frequently cited reason (40-50%) for choosing these careers was an
intrinsic interest in the subject matter, while only 3% identified
the pandemic as the primary reason for their choice. Analysis
of the ANUIES database revealed a 22% increase in first-year
applications to scientific programs and a 17% increase to health
care programs for the 2020-2021 academic year compared to 2019-2020,
with enrollment partially constrained by available capacity. These findings suggest
that the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to improved perceptions of
science, scientists, and health care workers among adolescents in Mexico,
and may have influenced an increase in interest in related
careers. Further research is needed to assess the persistence and
broader implications of these effects, as well as to determine
whether similar trends are observed in other countries with different
public policies, messaging, and pandemic outcomes.
