The species is capable of obstructing small streams and channels
due to its dense rhizome system (Lorenzi 2000, Amaral et
al. 2008) and has been identified as the most detrimental
invasive plant in Hawaii, where it forms extensive monospecific stands
(Herrera et al. 2016). Correa (1984) reports that H. coronarium
has various uses, including as an ornamental, medicinal, fungicidal, and
cosmetic plant, and its fibers are utilized in the production
of cellulose pulp (Kissmann & Groth 1991, Silva 2006, Martins
et al. 2010, Carrara et al. 2012). Ferreira et al.
(2016) recommend prohibiting the sale of this species in florists
and nurseries as a control measure to limit further invasions.
The climate in Brazil, which is similar to that of
Southeast Asia, has facilitated the establishment and spread of H.
coronarium throughout all Brazilian states, as documented in virtual catalogs
of national herbaria (Flora do Brasil 2020). The species' distribution
in Brazil may have resulted from accidental introduction via shipments
of commercial plants or intentional introduction for landscaping purposes (Primack
& Rodrigues 2001, Ziller 2001, Petenon & Pivello 2008).
