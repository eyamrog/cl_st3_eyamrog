Bridi (2020) found that job losses in Brazil during the
second quarter of 2020 were significantly higher among informal workers,
both when comparing salaried employees with and without formal contracts
and when comparing entrepreneurs with or without CNPJ registration. Similarly,
Corseuil et al. (2021) identified that the current crisis disproportionately
affected informal employment, with their findings indicating that more vulnerable
worker groups are overrepresented in informal sectors, resulting in substantial
negative implications for equity. Al Masri et al. (2021) reported
that the largest reductions in employment during the second and
third quarters of 2020 occurred among informal, self-employed, and younger
workers; they also observed that workforce outflow among men began
to decline in the third quarter, whereas it continued to
rise for women, and that industries requiring higher levels of
physical contact experienced the most significant job losses. However, none
of these studies specifically examined remote work or its determinants.
