In response to recent capital flow volatility, several economists have
critically examined the assumptions and theories supporting unrestricted capital mobility.
A notable example is Rey (2015), who challenges the applicability
of the macroeconomic trilemma (or impossible trinity) to emerging economies.
Using econometric analysis, Rey finds that cross-border financial flows via
banking institutions, specifically financial credits, lead to deviations from interest
rate uncovered parity in emerging economies, regardless of their exchange
rate regimes or macroeconomic fundamentals. Based on these findings, the
study argues that only the implementation of capital controls can
enhance the monetary policy autonomy of emerging economies, with such
controls specifically targeting financial credit and debt bond flows. Furthermore,
the research suggests that these regulatory measures should be applied
during periods of financial inflow booms and relaxed during downturns.
