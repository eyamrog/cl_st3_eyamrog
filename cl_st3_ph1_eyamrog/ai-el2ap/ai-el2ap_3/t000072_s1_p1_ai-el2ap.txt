Riparian forests have experienced fragmentation, which has altered seed dispersal
patterns and modified the composition of the soil seed bank.
The objective of this study is to identify the main
species present in the soil seed bank of a riparian
forest segment along the Mogi Guaçu River, adjacent to a
fragment of semideciduous forest located in the Guarnição da Aeronáutica
de Pirassununga, São Paulo State, Brazil. Ten plots measuring 10
x 10 m were established, and four soil samples per
plot were collected using a 25 x 25 cm template.
The samples were placed in a greenhouse to promote seed
germination and were monitored every 15 days over a six-month
period. In total, 494 individuals representing 19 families, 30 genera,
and 40 morphospecies were recorded. The diversity and distribution of
species within the fragment were found to be homogeneous, indicating
that this area may serve as a viable source of
propagules for forest restoration efforts.
