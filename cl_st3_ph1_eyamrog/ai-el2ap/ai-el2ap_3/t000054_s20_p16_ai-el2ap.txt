The hallucinogenic properties of Lophophora williamsii appear to have received
greater attention in the Western world than its traditional medicinal
uses for treating respiratory, rheumatic, and venereal diseases among Mexican
indigenous populations (Ibarra et al., 2015). Additionally, Lophophora williamsii synthesizes
other alkaloids of pharmaceutical interest, including anhalidine, lophophorin, and anhalonin
(Santos & Camarena, 2019).
