In 1998, Ecuador, through INEFAN, initiated legal action against the
patent; however, the lawsuit was unsuccessful. The primary reasons cited
were the lack of evidence that Ecuadorian folklore used frog
skin for medicinal purposes—its traditional use was as a hunting
poison—and the fact that ABT-594 was synthesized using the frog’s
skin structure as a model rather than being directly derived
from the skin itself (Jurado 2021). Nevertheless, from the perspective
of the bioethical principle of utilitarianism or beneficence, which emphasizes
maximizing benefits for the greatest number of people, it remains
pertinent to question why the indigenous communities inhabiting the regions
where the amphibian is found did not receive any benefits
(Proto 2019).
