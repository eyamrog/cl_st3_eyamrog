The final cohort comprised 983 adolescents aged 14 to 19
years (mean age 16.7 years; 63.5% female), with 66% between
16 and 18 years old, recruited from various states across
Mexico in a non-representative manner relative to the national population
distribution. Of these participants, 971 (98.8%) were enrolled in school,
with 69.8% attending public institutions, and the majority (77%) were
in the final years of high school. Additionally, 48% reported
that neither parent had completed university-level education (see Fig. 1).
