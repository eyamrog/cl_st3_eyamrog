In the context of Latin America, where extensive unexplored regions
and communities with limited exposure to modern influences remain, perspectives
on biodiversity tend to be polarized. One perspective, characterized as
Western or usufructuary, regards all natural entities as resources available
for large-scale exploitation. In contrast, the traditional or indigenous perspective
emphasizes respect for nature, coexistence with all species, and the
rational or even reverential use of natural resources. As noted
by Mart√≠nez et al. (2018), although the intrinsic properties of
a resource exist independently of human perception, it is humans
who assign market value to these resources and ultimately determine
the degree to which they are exploited or conserved.
