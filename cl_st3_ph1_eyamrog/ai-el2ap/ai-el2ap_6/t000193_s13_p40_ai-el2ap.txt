During the current pandemic, it is recommended that patients with
demyelinating diseases receive influenza vaccination, as coinfection with this respiratory
virus may result in more severe clinical outcomes. The immune
response to pneumococcal vaccination is significantly reduced in patients treated
with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies; therefore, it is advised that all
patients complete pneumococcal vaccination 2–3 weeks prior to initiating such
therapy, following a stepwise schedule consisting of a PCV13 prime
dose followed by a PPSV23 booster, with a minimum interval
of 8 weeks between the two vaccinations. For patients already
receiving anti-CD20 therapies, vaccination should be administered at least 2–3
weeks before the start of treatment or delayed until 5–7
months after the most recent infusion.
