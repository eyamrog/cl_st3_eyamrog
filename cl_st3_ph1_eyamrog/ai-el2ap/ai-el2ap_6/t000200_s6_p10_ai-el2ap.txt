The highest rates were observed in the Northeast and Far
West regions, while the lowest rates were recorded in Serra
Catarinense and XanxerÃª. Linear regression analysis by Health Region and
seasonal period indicated that, during periods of higher rainfall, all
regions experienced a monthly increase in leptospirosis rates ranging from
20% to 100%. In contrast, regions such as the Midwest
and Serra Catarinense exhibited lower peak rates and greater variability
in correlation averages, suggesting that these areas experience more abrupt
increases in rainfall, which are associated with significant but short-term
rises in leptospirosis cases. These findings differ from the patterns
observed during periods of lower rainfall, which were characterized by
lower disease rates and a substantial number of regions displaying
negative monthly percentage changes.
