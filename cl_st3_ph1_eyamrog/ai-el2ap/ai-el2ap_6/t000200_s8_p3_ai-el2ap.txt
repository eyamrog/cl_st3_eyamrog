Leptospirosis incidence exhibits seasonality, with peaks typically occurring during the
summer and fall in temperate climate countries and during the
rainy seasons in tropical regions. It is classified as an
emerging infectious disease, as its burden is projected to increase
in both developed and developing countries due to global climate
change, which is associated with more frequent extreme weather events
such as floods that facilitate leptospirosis outbreaks.
