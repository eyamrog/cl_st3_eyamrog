MOG IgG-associated optic neuritis, encephalitis, and myelitis (MONEM) can manifest
as either a monophasic or recurrent condition. Relapses in MOG
IgG-associated disease typically respond well to corticosteroid treatment. In cases
of recurrence, there is often persistent seropositivity for MOG IgG,
and the consideration of long-term immunosuppressive therapy should be individualized
based on the patient's clinical profile.
