Bradford's premise 8-9 states that scientific journals should be arranged
in descending order based on their productivity of documents on
a specific subject. The entire set should then be divided
into a core group of journals that are most dedicated
to the subject, along with several additional groups, or zones,
each containing the same number of documents as the core.
According to this premise, the number of journals in the
core and in each successive zone will follow the proportion
1:n:n²:n³, and so forth.
