The two-dimensional model comprising eleven items demonstrated adequate goodness-of-fit indices,
and the latent correlation between the two dimensions was within
acceptable limits (i.e., less than 0.80; see Table 3). The
first dimension consisted of eight items pertaining to satisfaction with
physicians’ working conditions, such as workload, working hours, and salary,
while the second dimension included three items related to structural
working conditions, specifically infrastructure and equipment. These results provide sufficient
evidence of validity based on the model’s internal structure, supporting
its use in subsequent analyses (see Figure 1).
