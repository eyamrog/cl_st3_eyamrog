Acquiring a new language requires the development of multiple skills
necessary for effective comprehension and communication. The four primary language
skills are listening, speaking, reading, and writing. In contexts where
English is taught as a foreign language and opportunities for
immersion are limited, such as in our country, it is
essential for teachers to employ innovative strategies and incorporate authentic
materials, as their instruction may constitute the primary source of
English exposure for students during the learning process (Bekes, 2016).
