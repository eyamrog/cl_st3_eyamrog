Belminus species were not attracted to volatiles emitted by cockroaches
in the Y-olfactometer; in fact, the three species tested—B. corredori,
B. ferroae, and B. herreri—actively avoided this odor. This finding
is unexpected, given that these Belminus species are known to
feed exclusively on cockroach hemolymph. During the experiments, the cockroaches
exhibited stress-related behaviors, such as compulsive movements, likely as a
result of negative pressure generated by the airflow in the
olfactometer flask. It is possible that the cockroaches released allomones,
or defensive volatile secretions, under these conditions (Schal 1992), which
may account for the avoidance behavior observed in Belminus. Additionally,
B. corredori and B. ferroae also avoided mouse waste, which
could be attributed to the potential predation risk posed by
mice. In contrast, both species were attracted to volatiles from
cockroach feces. Previous studies by Sandoval et al. (2004, 2010,
2013) have demonstrated that Belminus species are more closely adapted
to cockroaches than to mice, with domestic Belminus species frequently
found living with and feeding on cockroaches in human dwellings.
In natural environments, sylvatic Belminus are likely associated with insect
hosts residing under rocks, within tree bark, or with invertebrates
inhabiting vertebrate refuges such as caves, burrows, or nests. The
present results support the hypothesis proposed by Otálora-Luna and Guerin
(2014) that volatiles from host wastes, such as cockroach feces,
emanating from host refuges, stimulate host-searching behavior in triatomines.
