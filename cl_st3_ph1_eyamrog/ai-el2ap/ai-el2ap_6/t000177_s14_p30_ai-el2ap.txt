Humidification is recommended during winter months to maintain indoor relative
humidity (RH) at approximately 30%, as nasal passages and mucous
membranes are more vulnerable to infections at very low RH
levels of 10â€“20%. However, beginning in March, ambient climatic conditions
across all European regions typically result in RH levels exceeding
30% without the need for additional humidification.
