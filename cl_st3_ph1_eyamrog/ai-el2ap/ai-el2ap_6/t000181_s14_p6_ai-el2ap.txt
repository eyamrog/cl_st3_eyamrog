The authors granted permission for the use of the FCV-19S
and CPDI scales in this research. Both instruments were translated
and adapted for use in Brazilian Portuguese. Descriptive statistics were
employed for data analysis, including calculation of mean scores for
the CPDI and FCV-19S, frequency distributions by gender, and the
correlation coefficient between the two scales using Pearson's r.
