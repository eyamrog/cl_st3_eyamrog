In developing autonomy for conducting studies during the COVID-19 pandemic,
it is important to recognize that attention behavior in the
brain is organized into three levels: the alert state, focus,
and concentration. The alert state serves as the foundational condition
for achieving concentration within the teaching-learning process, as well as
for facilitating the adaptation of both educators and learners to
new physical and social environments. Additionally, motivation plays a critical
role in the teaching-learning process, as it directly influences both
attention and memory. Sustaining the alert state enables individuals to
achieve focus, which subsequently leads to concentration (42, 43). During
and following the COVID-19 pandemic, the relationship between educators and
learners should be carefully structured to support the neural processes
of encoding and plasticity, which underlie the formation of both
positive and negative memories, ranging from short-term to long-term storage
(44).
