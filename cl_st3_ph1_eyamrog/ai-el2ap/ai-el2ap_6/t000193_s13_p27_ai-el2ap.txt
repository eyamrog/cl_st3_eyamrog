Alemtuzumab is an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody used as induction therapy.
Administration of a single cycle leads to depletion of more
than 90% of both CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes within
the first month. Gradual lymphocyte recovery occurs over the following
year, reaching approximately 70% of baseline levels prior to the
initiation of the second cycle.
