Although grounded in empirical evidence, the laws of Bradford and
Lotka were effective in this study in supporting theoretical hypotheses
that the nucleus of journals is composed of the most
dedicated and consequently more productive authors. Furthermore, the findings indicated
that increased subject specificity enhances the likelihood of identifying distinct
groups of authors.
