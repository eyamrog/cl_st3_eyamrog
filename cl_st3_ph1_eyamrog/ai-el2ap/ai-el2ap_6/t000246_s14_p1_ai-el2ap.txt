This quantitative bibliometric study applies Bradford's Law of journal dispersion
and Lotka's Law of the inverse square to examine patterns
in scientific production and the utilization of electronically recorded information
within an international database, focusing on publications from 1989 to
2020. The analysis was restricted to documents indexed in the
Science web database, with all document types included as the
sole inclusion criterion and no exclusion criteria applied.
