We report the case of a 52-year-old male who presented
to the emergency department with a 5-day history of fever,
myalgia, abdominal pain, headache, cough, and dyspnea. The patient had
a history of asthma without recent exacerbations and denied other
comorbidities, smoking, or ongoing medication use. On admission, his vital
signs were within normal limits, and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2)
was greater than 95%. Laboratory investigations revealed no significant abnormalities
in white blood cell count or C-reactive protein levels. A
rapid influenza diagnostic test was negative. Non-enhanced chest computed tomography
(CT) demonstrated a few scattered ground-glass opacities in both lungs,
predominantly in the peripheral regions (Figure 1A). Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase
chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing of a nasopharyngeal swab was positive
for SARS-CoV-2, confirming the diagnosis of COVID-19. The patient was
hospitalized for three days and received antibiotic therapy with azithromycin.
