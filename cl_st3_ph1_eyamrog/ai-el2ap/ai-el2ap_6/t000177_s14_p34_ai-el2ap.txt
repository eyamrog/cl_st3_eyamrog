Taylor et al. [35] identified a correlation between mid-range humidity
levels and enhanced mammalian immune responses to respiratory infections. Mousavi
et al. [36] found that relative humidity (RH) values between
40% and 60% are the least favorable conditions for the
survival of microorganisms. Appropriate selection, operation, and maintenance of humidification
equipment are necessary when introducing water vapor into indoor environments
to achieve these mid-range humidity levels, which are associated with
reduced infection rates. The relationship between relative humidity and viral
activity is further supported by findings from studies on SARS
[35, 36].
