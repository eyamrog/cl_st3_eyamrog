This study, which stratified data by Health Regions to account
for the heterogeneous distribution of rainfall in Santa Catarina, provides
important insights into the geographic distribution of leptospirosis within the
state. The regions of Northeast, Far West, Médio Vale do
Itajaí, Grande Florianópolis, and Foz do Rio Itajaí collectively accounted
for over 75% of reported cases, with the Northeast region
alone contributing nearly 30% of the total cases.
