Since a quasi-experimental approach was employed, two separate measurements were
conducted: a pre-test administered prior to the intervention and a
post-test administered following the intervention. The significance level for this
social science research was set at Î± = 0.05, corresponding
to an assumed risk of 5% and a confidence level
of 95%.
