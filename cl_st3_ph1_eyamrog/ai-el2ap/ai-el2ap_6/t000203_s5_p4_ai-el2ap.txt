The new analysis presented in the May 2020 evaluation includes
non-BCG countries (Fig. 3), specifically Belgium, the United States, the
Netherlands, and Italy, which have never implemented BCG vaccination programs,
and compares them to countries that have discontinued such programs.
The findings indicate a similar acceleration in the number of
cases and deaths (Table 3) among both groups; however, countries
that have never had BCG vaccination programs exhibit higher incidence
and mortality rates (Table 2).
