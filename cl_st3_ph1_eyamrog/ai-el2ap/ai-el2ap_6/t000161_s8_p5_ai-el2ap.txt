This study aims to address several key questions: Does the
suppression of a journal from the Journal Impact Factor (JIF)
significantly influence research output in the field of taxonomy? What
are the implications of Zootaxaâ€™s suppression for the discipline of
taxonomy? How is self-citation defined in this context? What is
the average JIF for journals specializing in taxonomy? Is Zootaxa
experiencing negative consequences as a result of its prominence? To
effectively examine these issues, it is necessary to first clarify
relevant concepts and provide an overview of the current status
of taxonomic journals, the metrics used to assess scientific publications,
and the influence exerted by both individual researchers and large
publishing corporations within this domain.
