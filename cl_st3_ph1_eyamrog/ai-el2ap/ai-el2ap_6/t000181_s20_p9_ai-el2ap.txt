Gender differences, specifically the higher levels of fear and distress
reported by female respondents, may be attributable to social constructs.
It is possible that men, due to a lower tendency
to openly express fears related to COVID-19, may be less
likely to adhere to preventive sanitary recommendations established by the
World Health Organization (WHO) to control the spread of coronavirus
infection (WHO, 2008). This reduced adherence could manifest as diminished
responsiveness to risk communication from authorities and the media, as
well as lower compliance with recommended hygiene practices and social
distancing measures, all of which are critical factors in effective
pandemic control.
