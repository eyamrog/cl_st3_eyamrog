For nearly a decade, Zootaxa was the primary large-scale journal
dedicated to taxonomic science, although several smaller journals also published
a significant proportion of taxonomic papers. Currently, Zootaxa faces competition
from journals that offer Gold Open Access (GOA) or Diamond
Open Access (DOA) models, such as the European Journal of
Taxonomy (established in 2011) and ZooKeys (established in 2008). However,
ZooKeys requires a minimum article processing charge (APC) of €700
for mandatory open access, which presents a substantial barrier for
researchers from developing countries, particularly those not classified as low-income
and therefore ineligible for automatic fee waivers. The success of
Zootaxa, an initiative of Magnolia Press Ltd., contributed to the
establishment of additional journals, including Phytotaxa, which focuses on plant
sciences. Information about Magnolia Press, based in New Zealand, is
limited; for example, its website (magnoliapress.com) does not clearly specify
the company’s business model, such as whether it operates on
a for-profit or not-for-profit basis.
