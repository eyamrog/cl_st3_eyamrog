Chronic steroid use is frequently employed as a bridge therapy
in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) until immunosuppressive agents become
effective. The risk of infection associated with steroid use is
dose-dependent. Therefore, steroid tapering is recommended when it can be
performed safely. Telemedicine has been utilized to provide patient guidance
during the steroid tapering process.
