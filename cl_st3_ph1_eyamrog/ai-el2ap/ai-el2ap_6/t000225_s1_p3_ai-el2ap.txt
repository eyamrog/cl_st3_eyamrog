The results indicate that the social distancing strategies (SDS) implemented
in SÃ£o Paulo City and State were effective in delaying
the increase in COVID-19 cases. Analysis of the time series
data enabled the identification of distinct epidemiological trends across different
regions, supporting the potential for region-specific interventions. Furthermore, the use
of a death-oriented time series allowed for the assessment of
the impact of SDS in conjunction with the Social Isolation
Index (SII) adopted in the state, and facilitated a preliminary
estimation of the SII threshold necessary to prevent further disease
transmission.
