Leptospirosis is associated with patterns of unregulated land occupation, particularly
the construction of housing in floodplain areas lacking basic infrastructure.
Environmental changes resulting in the degradation of these areas contribute
to the creation of unhealthy conditions, thereby increasing the risk
for various diseases, including leptospirosis.
