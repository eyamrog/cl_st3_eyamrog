The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by the surgical
team, including an N95 mask or air-purifying respirator, goggles, sterile
waterproof suits, and a double layer of sterile gloves, is
recommended, with the team size minimized to the essential personnel
only. The study demonstrates that air-purifying respirators are preferable for
surgeries lasting longer than three hours due to increased comfort
for the surgeon. Additionally, vascular surgeons should be aware of
the challenges associated with using magnifying surgical loupes in conjunction
with PPE when operating on patients suspected or confirmed to
have COVID-19, particularly regarding the processes of removal and cleaning
of these devices.
