Several studies have reported that the protease inhibitors lopinavir and
ritonavir, which are used as HIV antivirals, also exhibit activity
against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Chu et al. 2004; Choy et
al. 2020). Both agents are capable of interacting with the
3CLpro protease, with ritonavir demonstrating a higher binding affinity than
lopinavir (Nutho et al. 2020). In animal models of SARS-CoV
and MERS-CoV infection, the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) with interferon-β
(IFN-β) significantly reduced viral load and improved pulmonary function. Clinical
data suggest that LPV/r may exert a synergistic effect in
the treatment of SARS (Yao et al. 2020). An ongoing
clinical trial (NCT02845843) is evaluating the efficacy of a combination
of lopinavir, ritonavir, and interferon-β1b in patients with MERS (Arabi
et al. 2020). In patients with COVID-19, combined LPV/r therapy
has been associated with a reduced time to viral clearance
(Yao et al. 2020) and an increase in eosinophil counts,
which may indicate clinical improvement (Liu et al. 2020). However,
other studies have found no significant benefit of lopinavir and
ritonavir in patients with advanced COVID-19 (Cao et al. 2020)
or in reducing the duration of SARS-CoV-2 shedding (Cheng et
al. 2020). A retrospective analysis of adverse drug reactions (ADRs)
among COVID-19 patients at the First Hospital of Changsha in
China indicated that approximately 64% of observed ADRs were associated
with LPV/r use (Sun et al. 2020), and patients receiving
LPV/r exhibited a significantly higher incidence of abnormal liver function
(Fan et al. 2020). Currently, approximately 211 clinical trials are
investigating these antivirals, including lopinavir, ritonavir, remdesivir, and favipiravir, either
alone, in combination, or with other agents in patients with
SARS-CoV-2 infection (Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register).
