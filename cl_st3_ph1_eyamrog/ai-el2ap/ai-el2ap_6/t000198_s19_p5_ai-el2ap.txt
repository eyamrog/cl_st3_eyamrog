At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Australia was among
the first countries to implement stringent measures, including social distancing,
travel restrictions, and protocols for testing and tracking infected individuals.
Consequently, universities began closing from mid-March, resulting in the suspension
of all clinical and pre-clinical activities while theoretical components, such
as seminars, lectures, and journal clubs, continued in an online
format. This transition necessitated a rapid adaptation by both students
and academic staff, with platforms such as Microsoft Teams® and
BlackBoard Collaborate ULTRA® serving as the primary tools for learning
and teaching at Griffith University. Additionally, several clinically oriented scenarios
were developed and delivered as online problem-based learning (PBL) discussions,
and all examinations in Semester 1 were conducted online.
