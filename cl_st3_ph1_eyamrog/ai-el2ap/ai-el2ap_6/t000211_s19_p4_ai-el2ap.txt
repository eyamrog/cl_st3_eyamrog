The study did not recommend the use of ECD for
excluding the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) due to its
low diagnostic accuracy. A negative D-dimer (DD) result combined with
a low modified Wells score was considered sufficient to rule
out PE. However, in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which
is associated with elevated DD levels, the utility of DD
as a diagnostic tool is reduced; nevertheless, elevated DD values
should still be taken into consideration in the clinical assessment.
