Rituximab is commonly used in the treatment of neuromyelitis optica
spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Its administration is associated with an increased
risk of severe viral infections through several mechanisms, as previously
described. Monitoring immunoglobulin levels and providing replacement therapy when indicated
may help mitigate this risk. In the context of B-cell
monitoring for NMOSD, assessing CD27+ memory B-cells, rather than CD19+
B-cells, may offer a more accurate indicator of rituximab efficacy.
Evidence from one study indicates that over half of NMOSD
relapses occurred when CD19+ B-cell counts were below 0.01 Ã—
10^9/L but remained above the therapeutic threshold for CD27+ memory
B-cells. However, since CD27 marker assessment is not routinely available
in clinical practice and NMOSD relapses can be life-threatening, it
is recommended to maintain rituximab administration at regular six-month intervals.
