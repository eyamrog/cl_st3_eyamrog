The administration of prophylactic doses of fondaparinux, low molecular weight
heparin (LMWH), or unfractionated heparin (UFH) is strongly recommended for
all hospitalized patients. If pharmacological prophylaxis is contraindicated, mechanical prophylaxis,
such as limb compression devices, should be utilized.
