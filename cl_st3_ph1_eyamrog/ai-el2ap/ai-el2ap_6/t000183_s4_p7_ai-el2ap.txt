The effectiveness of graphic organizers in enhancing reading comprehension in
EFL classrooms has been well documented. Graphic organizers offer students
visual representations that facilitate the organization and integration of linguistic
information, enabling dual coding of content both visually and linguistically.
This dual coding supports students in processing and retaining information
more effectively.
