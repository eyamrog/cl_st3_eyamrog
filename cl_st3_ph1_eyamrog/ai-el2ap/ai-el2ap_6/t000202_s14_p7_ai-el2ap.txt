The administered survey is organized into three general modules—students' identification
data, cultural facilities, and interest in cultural activities—and twelve sector-specific
modules. These sector-specific modules address the following areas: museums, art
galleries, archives, arts and craft fairs, Houses of Culture, monuments,
archaeological sites, reading and libraries, ballet or dance, opera and
theater, concerts of classical and modern music, film and video,
music, television, radio, computer and Internet use, leisure and culture-related
free time activities, and a final section focused on the
cultural actions and programs implemented by UNAE, as well as
the participation and interest of the student population.
