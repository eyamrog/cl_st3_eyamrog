The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted health education, with dental education
being particularly affected. Due to considerable uncertainty regarding the natural
history of the disease and the necessity to safeguard the
health of students, staff, and patients, various measures were implemented,
including the suspension of teaching, research, and other on-campus activities.
These strategies differed across countries and were influenced by the
stage of the local epidemic curve. Additionally, efforts were made
to review and update Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) protocols, organize
pre- and post-clinical environments, and modify clinical dental procedures. The
measures adopted have resulted in numerous challenges that are likely
to have long-term consequences. In this context, the current situation
provides an opportunity to share experiences, evaluate responses, and inform
the future development of dental education.
