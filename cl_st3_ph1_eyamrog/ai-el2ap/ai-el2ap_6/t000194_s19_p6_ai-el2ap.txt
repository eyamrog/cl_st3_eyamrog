In the Cor de Ch√° River, only a single sampling
was conducted, resulting in the documentation of six occurrences. Despite
the limited sampling effort, this site yielded four exclusive taxa:
Dactylellina appendiculata (Anastasiou) M. Scholler, Hagedorn & A. Rubner (Figure
3b), Isthmolongispora minima Matsush. (Figure 2f), Pleiochaeta amazonensis Matsush. (Figure
3c), and Subulispora longirostrata Nawawi & Kuthub (Figure 4a).
