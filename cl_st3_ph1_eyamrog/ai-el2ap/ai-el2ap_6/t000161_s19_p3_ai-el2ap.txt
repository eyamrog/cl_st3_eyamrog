The influence of self-citations on the Journal Impact Factor (JIF)
is generally minimal, as most journals in the categories of
Entomology, Zoology, and TTJ exhibit similar mean ratios between JIF
values calculated with and without self-citations for the period 2010–2018
(Figure 5). Exceptions to this trend include Shilap-Revista de Lepidopterologia,
Insects (published by Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute [MDPI]), and Zootaxa.
Notably, MDPI has been reported to engage in questionable publishing
practices (Retraction Watch 2018) and has been classified as predatory
(Brezgov 2014). Some journals display substantial variability, as indicated by
large standard deviations in the influence of self-citations on JIF,
whereas journals such as Zootaxa demonstrate a more consistent effect.
Specifically, for Zootaxa, the ratio of JIF without self-citations to
JIF with self-citations ranges from 0.55 to 0.60, corresponding to
a reduction in JIF of 39.6–45.6% when self-citations are excluded
(Figure 6, Supplementary File 1).
