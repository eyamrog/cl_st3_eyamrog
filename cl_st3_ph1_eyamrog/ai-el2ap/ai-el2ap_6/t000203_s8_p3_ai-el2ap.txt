The innate immune response, which includes macrophages, CD4+ lymphocytes, and
natural killer cells, plays a critical role in the elimination
of viral pathogens. Variability in the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection
across different countries and among individuals with similar exposure levels
may be attributable to differences in immune system responses. Therefore,
it is essential to understand the quality and effectiveness of
both individual and collective innate immune responses. In this context,
the present study aimed to examine the correlation between the
epidemic impact observed in various countries over three consecutive months
and their respective Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination status, given that
BCG vaccination is known to primarily activate or train innate
immunity.
