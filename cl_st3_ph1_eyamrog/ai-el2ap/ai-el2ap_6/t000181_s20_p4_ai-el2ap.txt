Given that the gender dimensions of the pandemic are both
biological and socially constructed, resulting in differential impacts on men
and women (Smith, 2019), women are generally perceived as being
more aware of their healthcare needs, more likely to adhere
to counseling and treatment, and more inclined to seek healthcare
services than men (Rugema et al., 2019). This tendency may
account for the higher proportion of female respondents in this
and similar surveys (Lauri Korajlija & Jokic‚ÄêBegic, 2020).
