Another approach to broadening the scope of the Network's activities
involves the use of social media platforms, such as maintaining
a Facebook account to communicate the Networkâ€™s official positions on
contemporary issues and to release statements regarding topics including abortion,
gender-based violence, and obstetric violence. Furthermore, it has been observed
that the Network disseminates messages to individuals who are not
members.
