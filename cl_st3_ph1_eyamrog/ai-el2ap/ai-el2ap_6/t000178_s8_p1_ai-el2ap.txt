Peru is recognized as one of the most biodiverse countries
globally. Recent estimates indicate the presence of 20,533 plant species,
5,738 vertebrate species, and 30,547 arthropod species within its territory
(MINAM, 2019). However, there are currently no comprehensive records regarding
the diversity of bacteria or archaea in Peru. Effective conservation
and management of this extensive biodiversity require a range of
approaches that incorporate ecological, systematic, and, more recently, genetic diversity
data (Norena et al., 2018). Such information is critical not
only for conservation and taxonomic research but also for applications
including the bioprospecting of novel compounds (Sekurova et al., 2019)
and the implementation of breeding programs utilizing genetic markers (Assefa
et al., 2019; Mrode, 2019).
