A recent literature review [46] examining the evidence on vitamin
D supplementation during the COVID-19 pandemic recommended that both patients
and healthcare staff in hospital settings should consider vitamin D
supplementation to achieve serum 25(OH)D concentrations of at least 40–50
ng/mL (100–125 nmol/L). To reach these levels, the authors proposed
an initial dose of 10,000 IU per day for one
month, followed by a maintenance dose of 5,000 IU per
day. Nevertheless, the review emphasized that the hypothesis regarding vitamin
D supplementation’s potential to reduce the risk of influenza and
COVID-19 incidence and mortality requires further investigation through clinical trials
to determine optimal dosing, target serum 25(OH)D concentrations, and to
assess any associated safety concerns.
