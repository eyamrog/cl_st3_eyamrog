Triatomine bugs are nest-dwelling ectoparasites (Guerin et al. 2000) and
serve as vectors for Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastida, Trypanosomatidae), the etiological
agent of Chagas disease. These insects typically maintain a close
association with their hosts, occupying the same shelters and repeatedly
feeding on the same individuals throughout their life cycle. Under
natural conditions, most triatomine species feed on humans and other
vertebrates at night, primarily when the hosts are asleep. Triatomines
acquire T. cruzi by feeding on infected vertebrate hosts, such
as opossums, armadillos, and bats. Within the vector, the parasite
differentiates into the epimastigote stage, which migrates to the rectum
and subsequently transforms into the infectious metacyclic trypomastigote form (Schofield
et al. 1987). Transmission to new hosts occurs when triatomines
defecate during or shortly after feeding, depositing infectious trypomastigotes onto
the host’s skin. The parasites can then enter the host
through the bite wound or via mucous membranes. While T.
cruzi is capable of surviving in the gut of all
triatomine species, vector competence varies among species due to factors
such as triatomine population density, host preference (Gütler et al.
2009), and the defecation index, defined as the interval between
feeding and defecation (Aldana and Lizano 2004).
