The anticipated duration of the pandemic is closely linked to
the development of new pharmaceuticals and the potential availability of
a vaccine [16]. The timeline for school closures as a
strategy to mitigate or contain COVID-19 transmission remains uncertain, and
it is possible that periods of reopening and reclosing may
occur intermittently. This uncertainty necessitates an evaluation of the sustainability
and effectiveness of the interventions implemented. In the context of
school feeding programs, it is essential that the measures adopted
are flexible and responsive to these evolving scenarios.
