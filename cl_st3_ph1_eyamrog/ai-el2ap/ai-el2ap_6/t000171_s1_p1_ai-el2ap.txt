A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is responsible for a global pandemic
with significant socioeconomic impacts. Due to its recent emergence in
Wuhan, China, in December 2019, many aspects of the virus
remain insufficiently understood by the scientific community. This study aims
to analyze the spatio-temporal associations of incidence, mortality, and the
rates of both rapid and RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 in
the state of Minas Gerais.
