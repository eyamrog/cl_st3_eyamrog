This study aimed to describe and compare the approaches taken
by three dental schools from different countries in managing dental
education during the COVID-19 pandemic. The progression and impact of
the pandemic varied across Australia, Brazil, and the United States.
As of early June 2020, the United States and Brazil
ranked first and second, respectively, in the number of confirmed
COVID-19 cases worldwide [5]. In Australia, the number of new
cases increased rapidly and peaked in March 2020; however, since
mid-April, the country has reported a sustained and relatively low
number of new cases, with fewer than 20 new cases
per day since 22 April [7].
