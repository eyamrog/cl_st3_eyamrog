A simple flow chart can facilitate the retention and comprehension
of information; however, for tasks involving application and analysis, students
should be required to utilize a variety of graphic organizers,
such as those designed for comparing and contrasting information or
for evaluating cause and effect, as well as the positive
and negative aspects of a subject, particularly when the objective
is to promote higher-order thinking skills.
