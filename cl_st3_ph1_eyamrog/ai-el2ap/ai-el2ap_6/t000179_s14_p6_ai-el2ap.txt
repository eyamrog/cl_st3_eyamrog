In 2016, SUSALUD organized a meeting with representatives from the
Social Security, Armed Forces and Police Health Services, officials from
the Comprehensive Health Insurance, and four universities in Lima, Peru.
During this meeting, modifications to the existing questionnaires were discussed,
with the decision to retain the items from ENSUSALUD 2015
and to add 29 new preliminary scales.
