This research aims to identify indicators and evaluate the primary
consumption patterns, habits, and cultural practices of university students at
UNAE, which constitute the main objectives of the study. The
theoretical framework is based on the initial models proposed by
Canclini (2006) and Bigott (2007), while also considering the socio-historical
changes resulting from new forms and modes of consumption associated
with the development and integration of new technologies. Within this
context, previous conceptualizations are revisited. Specifically, the processes of appropriation
and use of technological and cultural devices are analyzed not
from an economic perspective, but rather from the standpoint of
meaning-making that elucidates social behaviors. Additionally, the term "habit" is
defined as the frequent engagement in certain cultural behaviors, which
does not necessarily imply the actual practice of these activities,
whereas "practice" refers to specific domains such as recorded music,
video, television, radio, computers, and the Internet.
