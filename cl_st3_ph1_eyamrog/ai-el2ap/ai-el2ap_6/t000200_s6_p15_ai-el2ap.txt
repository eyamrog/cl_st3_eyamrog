It is important to note, however, that the morbidity data
for leptospirosis presented in this analysis may be underestimated, as
the disease can be misdiagnosed as other febrile illnesses. Furthermore,
the majority of reported cases are derived from hospital records,
which primarily capture patients with more severe manifestations of the
disease.
