During the intervention period, teachers instructed students in the use
of various graphic organizers deemed suitable for each reading text.
Reading materials were selected based on the age and interests
of the group to promote student engagement. When new graphic
organizers were introduced to the experimental group, the teacher explicitly
explained their purpose and provided guidance on their application. In
contrast, the control group continued to participate in standard reading
activities without the introduction of graphic organizers.
