Assessing physician job satisfaction in low- and middle-income countries is
essential, as these settings are more frequently affected by complex
labor dynamics such as limited financial compensation, restricted opportunities for
career development, high workload, and inadequate legal protection compared to
high-income countries (7). In many developing countries, job dissatisfaction among
physicians can contribute to the migration of health workers abroad,
resulting in shortages of specialists (8-10). Although evaluating physician satisfaction
in the workplace is highly relevant, it presents significant methodological
challenges, as it requires the assessment of multiple factors and
dimensions of the work environment that extend beyond individual knowledge
and experience. Evidence indicates that job satisfaction is associated with
the quality of the doctor-patient relationship, workload, relationships with colleagues,
financial conditions, and autonomy in clinical decision-making (11, 12). Many
of these factors are modifiable, highlighting the importance of developing
appropriate measurement tools for use in complex healthcare environments. While
numerous scales exist for assessing job satisfaction, many have not
been adapted for use in low- and middle-income contexts, nor
do they account for the specific characteristics of these healthcare
systems (12, 13). Therefore, it is necessary to develop and
utilize instruments that are contextualized to the unique features of
each healthcare system to minimize the risk of measurement bias.
