Behaviors such as ambushing, grasping, dragging, apprehension, and paralyzing, which
are characteristic of predatory reduviids, were not observed in Belminus
species. The paralyzing or lethal effects induced by assassin bugs
differ from the sedation effect produced by Belminus, as the
latter do not aim to kill their hosts but rather
to feed as ectoparasites. Triatomines, including Belminus, have adapted to
coexist with their hosts. Notably, cockroaches typically recover from the
lethargy induced by Belminus feeding and are able to survive
subsequent feeding events. Therefore, Belminus species do not exhibit predatory
behavior typical of other reduviids and should not be classified
as assassin bugs. Similar to other triatomine species, Belminus are
not active hunters but function as ectoparasites, exploiting moments of
host vulnerability to obtain fluids.
