Federal Law 13,987/20 was established with the explicit aim of
ensuring the distribution of food to families of students affected
by school closures. Following the enactment of this law, the
government of the Federal District implemented a policy of providing
food allowances to parents of public school students. However, there
is limited publicly available information regarding the monitoring and evaluation
of this mitigation measure. According to data published on the
website of the State Bureau for Education of the Federal
District (SEEDF) [20], during the three phases of fund distribution,
69,848 families, corresponding to 106,435 students, received benefits. No information
is available concerning the criteria used for the allocation of
food allowances or the proportion of beneficiary families relative to
the total number of students enrolled in the public school
system of the Federal District. Furthermore, for those who do
receive government assistance, it is necessary to assess the adequacy
of this support in meeting children's nutritional needs, given that
the nutritional standards maintained by schools may not be replicated
in the home environment.
