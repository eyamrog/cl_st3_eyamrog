To analyze the behavioral details in Arenas 1–3, both frontal
and top views of the experimental arenas were recorded in
full-screen mode using a CMOS video camera (EOS Rebel T7i,
Canon) equipped with a zoom lens (EF-S 15–55 mm f,
IS, Canon) and a macro lens (close-up +10, 58 mm,
Commander), providing a diagonal field of view of 40 mm.
The camera was mounted on a pivoting base to enable
complete visual coverage of each arena. All experiments were conducted
in a darkened room. Illumination for Arenas 1 and 2
was provided by a LED lamp (2850K, 570 lumens, Reveal,
General Electric), while Arena 3 was illuminated with a LED
infrared lamp (840 nm, Cmvision); the camera’s infrared sensitivity enabled
observation and recording under these conditions. Video recordings were analyzed
using computer software (version 9.1.2.7, Wondershare Filmora9) for playback, tracking,
and editing. The ethological terminology used to describe triatomine behaviors
was based on the frameworks proposed by Kogon (1941) and
Crist (1998).
