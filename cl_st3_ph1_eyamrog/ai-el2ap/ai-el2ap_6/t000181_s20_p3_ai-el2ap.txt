Based on the data presented in Table 1, the majority
of participants were single (48.7%) women (79.8%), with a mean
age of 36.2 years, most having up to one child
(75.7%), and a high proportion possessing a college degree, either
completed or in progress (89.7%). Additionally, most participants were employed
(69.5%), had health insurance (69.4%), and were in social isolation
during the pandemic (87.0%). This demographic profile is relevant from
a psychological perspective, as it aligns with established biological, behavioral,
and cognitive differences between genders that can influence health care
approaches, including the manifestation, epidemiology, and pathophysiology of common diseases
(Regitz-Zagrosek, 2012).
