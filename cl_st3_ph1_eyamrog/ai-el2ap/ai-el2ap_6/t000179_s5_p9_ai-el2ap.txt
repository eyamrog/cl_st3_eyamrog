One strength of this study is the representativeness of the
results at the national level in Peru, which enabled the
assessment of the scales across various outpatient settings. Additionally, quality
control measures and real-time monitoring were implemented during data collection.
However, the study has three main limitations. First, although evidence
of internal structure was established for the three instruments, the
scales did not include cut-off points to determine whether a
Peruvian physician was satisfied with any of the evaluated dimensions,
due to the absence of robust results in both sensitivity
and specificity analyses. Second, validity and reliability estimates were calculated
exclusively for outpatient physicians, limiting the generalizability of the findings
to other health professionals or to physicians working in hospital
or community settings. Third, as this was a secondary data
analysis, it was not possible to assess certain variables that
could provide a more comprehensive understanding of job satisfaction, such
as race or the presence of a diagnosed mental health
condition.
