The observed heterogeneity in the incidence and mortality rates of
COVID-19, as well as in the testing rates (including both
rapid and RT-PCR tests) across the territory of Minas Gerais,
may be partially attributable to the varying dates of virus
introduction in different municipalities and macro-regions. This variation is likely
influenced by the dynamics of regional and inter-regional population movement.
