Interferon release constitutes a critical innate defense mechanism against viral
infections. In vivo studies have demonstrated that treatment with IFN-β1b
reduces pulmonary infiltrates, bronchointerstitial pneumonia, and viral load in MERS-CoV
infection (Chan et al. 2015). Additionally, IFN-α, a mismatched double-stranded
RNA interferon inducer, and the interferon inducer Ampligen, have been
shown to inhibit SARS-CoV replication in the lungs (Barnard et
al. 2006). IFN-λ has also exhibited antiviral activity against both
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV by establishing an antiviral state with minimal
induction of systemic inflammation (Prokunina-Olsson et al. 2020). A review
of the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register indicates that antibodies targeting
cytokines are investigated in 88 studies, while 34 studies focus
specifically on interferons, either by inhibiting their activity or administering
recombinant forms as therapeutic interventions.
