When a kissing bug approaches a host to feed, it
exhibits a highly stereotyped behavioral sequence known as a fixed
action pattern (FAP), which is relatively consistent within Triatominae and
more broadly within Heteroptera. According to Páez-Rondón et al. (2018),
various stimuli—including thermal, chemical, visual, and olfactory cues—are sufficient to
initiate the FAP associated with triatomine feeding. The behavioral sequence
described by these authors begins with orientation toward an object,
followed by visualization, antennal exploration, contact with the legs, extension
of the proboscis, and ingestion of liquid. In the present
study, building on the findings of Páez-Rondón et al. (2018),
we describe the FAP utilized by B. ferroae to identify,
approach, and feed on a living cockroach. The concept of
"orientation" as used by these authors and in the current
study, as discussed by Roeder (1998), occupies an intermediate position
between behaviorist and ethological frameworks. In light of Crist’s (1998)
critique of the semantic conventions of early ethologists, and considering
stylistic elements employed by early animal behavior researchers (Darwin and
Wallace 1858; Darwin 1983; Humboldt 1991), we sought to identify
distinctive innate traits that could inform the phylogenetic placement of
Belminus species. The primary ethological question addressed was how Belminus
species approach their prey in comparison to ancestral assassin bugs.
Previous research on triatomine orientation behavior has primarily focused on
host-derived odors, such as those from skin and breath, which
are metabolic by-products associated with the host’s microflora and vertebrate
metabolism (Otálora-Luna et al. 2004; Guerenstein and Lazzari 2009; Aldana
et al. 2008; Ortiz et al. 2011).
