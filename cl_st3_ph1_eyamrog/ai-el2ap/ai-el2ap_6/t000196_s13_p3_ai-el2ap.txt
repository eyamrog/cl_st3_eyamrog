During the pandemic, alternatives to traditional classroom education, such as
distance teaching and remote monitoring, were implemented to mitigate the
potential negative effects on cognitive development resulting from the interruption
of regular school instruction. The roles of schools in providing
care and facilitating socialization are significant, and school closures have
had a substantial impact on these functions. However, social distancing
requirements complicate the implementation of measures aimed at mitigating these
effects. In this context, school food provision has emerged as
a relevant issue, and it is necessary to evaluate whether
the measures adopted in this area adequately address the urgency
of the problem.
