For future studies, we recommend testing olfactory and visual cues
independently, for example by using a cockroach dummy or by
presenting multimodal stimuli on the servosphere, in order to determine
whether olfaction alone is sufficient or necessary to elicit fixed
action patterns (FAP). Additionally, we suggest combining different stimuli to
clarify the mechanisms underlying the convergence of visual cues, such
as varying light treatments, and olfactory cues, as described in
previous studies (Reisenman et al. 2000; Ot√°lora-Luna and Dickens 2011).
