COVID-19 may increase the risk of venous and arterial thromboembolic
events as a result of excessive inflammation, hypoxia, immobilization, and
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Consequently, it is necessary to perform
risk stratification for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in all hospitalized patients,
utilizing assessment tools such as the Caprini score. Additionally, it
is important to employ complementary scoring systems to evaluate the
risk of bleeding in this population.
