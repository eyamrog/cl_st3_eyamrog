Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an induction therapy for
multiple sclerosis (MS) that aims to halt disease progression through
immune cell depletion followed by immune system reconstitution. This intervention
produces prolonged and significant effects on immune function. Individuals who
have recently undergone HSCT are advised to extend their period
of isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic due to increased susceptibility
to infections. Patients who are candidates for HSCT should consult
their neurologists to evaluate the risks and benefits of proceeding
with or postponing the procedure in the context of the
pandemic. Table 2 provides a summary of considerations related to
the use of disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) for MS during the
COVID-19 pandemic.
