Multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) require
ongoing preventive treatment to reduce the risk of disability and
enhance quality of life. Although there is currently no cure
for either MS or NMOSD, the long-term prognosis for patients
with these conditions has improved significantly over the past decade,
primarily due to the development of highly active immunotherapeutic strategies.
These strategies involve the use of disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) that
modulate or suppress immune system activity, which may compromise the
body's normal response to infections. The management of patients with
demyelinating disorders is complex and necessitates regular clinical assessments, routine
central nervous system imaging, and laboratory monitoring, all of which
can present additional challenges during a pandemic.
