The literature search identified 1,691 articles related to the surveyed
micronutrients. After removing 29 duplicate records, 1,662 articles remained. Screening
of titles and abstracts according to the predefined eligibility criteria
resulted in the exclusion of 1,615 articles. The full texts
of the remaining 47 articles were assessed, and ultimately, 6
studies met the inclusion criteria and were selected for this
review (Figure 1).
