Applying the same analytical approach to health macro-regions clarifies the
observed associations. Aggregating cities into larger regions diminishes the influence
of outlier cities—specifically, those with test rates per thousand that
exceed two standard deviations above the mean and are of
small population size—on the overall results. The Pearson correlation coefficient
between the elapsed time since the first notified case in
the state of Minas Gerais and the number of rapid
tests was -0.59; for RT-PCR tests, the coefficient was -0.25;
for incidence rate, -0.70; and for mortality rate, -0.71.
