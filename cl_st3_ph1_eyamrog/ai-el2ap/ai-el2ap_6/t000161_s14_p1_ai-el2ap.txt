We analyzed citation data, including Journal Impact Factor (JIF), most-cited
journals, and self-citation metrics, from the Journal Citation Reports (Web
of Science Core Collection™) for the years 2010–2018, focusing on
the top ten zoological journals (TTJ; eight of which are
included in JCR) as determined by the number of new
available names based on the last five years of ION/Zoological
Records™ (ZR). Additionally, we examined journals that focus on or
regularly publish taxonomic papers within the Zoology and Entomology categories.
Data for Zootaxa were obtained from JCR 2018, as this
journal was suppressed from the current edition and is expected
to reappear in September. Journals listed in both the Zoology
and Entomology categories were classified as Zoology for this analysis.
Out of 168 journals in Zoology and 101 in Entomology,
73 and 48 journals, respectively (including Zootaxa), were selected, resulting
in a total of 123 journals for which data were
compiled. For journals with available data from 2010–2018, we applied
descriptive statistical methods, including calculation of the arithmetic mean and
standard deviation of bibliometric variables, as well as the ratio
of JIF without self-citations to total JIF, to assess the
influence of self-citations on JIF. This analysis was conducted for
the TTJ in ZR and for journals in the Zoology
and Entomology categories. The percentage of self-citations and the annual
ratio of JIF without self-citations to total JIF for journals
in quartiles 2 and 3 (Q2 and Q3) of their
respective categories, as well as for the TTJ, were analyzed
using the non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis H test (Dalgaard 2008) in R
software (R Core Team 2018). Journals with a similar scope
and JIF to Zootaxa were included, specifically those publishing taxonomic
papers with a 2019 JIF ranging from 0.25 to 2.315
in the Zoology and Entomology categories. This selection criterion is
somewhat arbitrary, as the proportion of taxonomic papers varies among
journals; for example, Zootaxa and ZooKeys publish a higher volume
of taxonomic papers, even though they also accept studies on
other biological science topics. Nevertheless, for the purposes of this
study, it is reasonable to consider these journals as similar
in scope. Direct comparison is challenging because Zootaxa’s original scope
is distinct, emphasizing rapid publication of high-quality papers on any
aspect of systematic zoology and favoring longer manuscripts. Currently, Zootaxa
publishes a wide range of topics related to zoological taxonomy
and systematics, including biographies and theoretical perspectives, but generally excludes
papers focused primarily on ecological or experimental issues. The list
of journals and selected metrics is provided in Table 1
and Supplementary File 1. It should be noted that journal
categorization follows Web of Science’s classification, and as a result,
some taxonomic journals relevant to zoology or entomology were excluded
if they are listed under other categories within the Science
Edition database.
