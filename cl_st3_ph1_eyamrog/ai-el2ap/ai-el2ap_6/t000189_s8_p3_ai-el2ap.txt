The role of adequate nutritional status in modulating the immune
response and reducing the risk of infections is well documented
in the literature [8,9]. Micronutrients such as vitamins A and
D, iron, zinc, and folate are recognized for their involvement
in multiple aspects of the immune response, including the differentiation,
proliferation, and function of innate immune cells, the regulation of
cytokine production, and the development and production of antibodies [8].
