After identifying the difficulties that students encounter when reading texts
in English and reviewing existing literature on various strategies and
their effectiveness, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of
using graphic organizers on EFL reading comprehension. To achieve this
objective, graphic organizers were implemented at three distinct stages of
the reading process: before reading (pre-reading), during reading, and after
reading (post-reading).
