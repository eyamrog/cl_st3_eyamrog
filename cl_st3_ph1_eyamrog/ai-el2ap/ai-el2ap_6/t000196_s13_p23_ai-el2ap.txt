In Brazil, family health community agents—currently numbering over 200,000—play a
significant role in supporting underserved communities by promoting health surveillance,
primary care, and community health initiatives [21]. During the COVID-19
pandemic, these agents have the potential to monitor families and,
specifically in relation to children and adolescents, to oversee both
health status and dietary intake. This monitoring could be facilitated
through telemedicine and would involve collaboration among families, schools, government
entities, and health agents (see Figure 2). Alternatively, the government
may designate another actor to assume these responsibilities as needed.
