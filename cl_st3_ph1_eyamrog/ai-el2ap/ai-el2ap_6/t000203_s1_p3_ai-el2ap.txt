Methods: The second phase of a three-phase data survey was
conducted using official sources to obtain the number of COVID-19
cases and deaths between April 11 and May 11, 2020.
Incidence, mortality, and case fatality rates were calculated and compared
among predefined groups based on their BCG vaccination programs. Additionally,
the acceleration rate of cases and deaths during the study
period was calculated and compared between these groups.
