The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic represents a significant threat
to global health. COVID-19 is a rapidly spreading respiratory infection
caused by a novel coronavirus first identified in December 2019.
Due to its potential to progress to severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) and its high transmission rate—where, on average, each
infected individual transmits the virus to approximately two others—it presents
substantial challenges to public health systems and clinical practice. Current
projections indicate that the pandemic may persist for at least
18 months. During this period, the management of chronic autoimmune
diseases is expected to remain particularly challenging.
