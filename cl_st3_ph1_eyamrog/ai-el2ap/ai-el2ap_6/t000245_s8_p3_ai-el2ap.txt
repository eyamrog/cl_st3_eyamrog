Species of this family, with the exception of the genus
Haddowia, are widely distributed throughout tropical regions and have been
recorded in various Brazilian ecosystems (Gibertoni & Cavalcanti 2003, Ryvarden
2004, Silveira et al. 2008, Baltazar & Gibertoni 2009, Campacci
& Gugliotta 2009, Drechsler-Santos et al. 2009, Gomes-Silva & Gibertoni
2009, Gibertoni & Drechsler-Santos 2010, Gugliotta et al. 2010, Gomes-Silva
et al. 2011, Costa-Rezende et al. 2016, Bononi et al.
2017). However, knowledge of this family in the Cerrado biome
is limited to records of 17 species, primarily from the
genera Amauroderma and Ganoderma (Gibertoni & Drechsler-Santos 2010, Abrah√£o et
al. 2012, Maia et al. 2015, Costa-Rezende et al. 2016,
Bononi et al. 2017). This study reports new occurrences of
Ganodermataceae species in the Brazilian Cerrado and Midwest region.
