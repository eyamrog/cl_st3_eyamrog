Analysis of the eight Health Regions with the highest leptospirosis
incidence and the greatest ratios of cases to precipitation index
showed that the average leptospirosis rate decreased from 12.1 cases
per 100,000 inhabitants in areas with higher rainfall to 5.73
cases per 100,000 inhabitants in areas with lower rainfall, representing
a reduction of 52.7%. In contrast, among the eight Health
Regions with the lowest incidence rates and lowest rainfall indices,
the average rate declined from 2.75 to 1.56 cases per
100,000 inhabitants, corresponding to a decrease of 43.3%.
