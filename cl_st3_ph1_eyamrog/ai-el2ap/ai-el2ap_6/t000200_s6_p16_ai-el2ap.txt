A contributing factor to the spread of leptospirosis is the
occurrence of heavy seasonal rains that lead to flooding; this
risk persists even with lower rainfall volumes when soil waterproofing
reduces water absorption and increases the likelihood of flooding. Periods
of increased rainfall and subsequent flooding are associated with greater
dissemination of leptospirosis among both the general population and health
professionals. Additionally, these conditions tend to result in a higher
and more rapid demand for health services, facilitating earlier and
more accurate diagnosis and treatment.
