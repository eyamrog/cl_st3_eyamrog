Replication of SARS-CoV-2 is initiated by the translation of the
pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins from the single-stranded, positive-sense genomic RNA
(ssRNA+), which possesses a 5’ cap and a 3’ poly(A)
tail (Figure 1). The pp1ab polyprotein is generated through a
-1 ribosomal frameshift mechanism that occurs during translation, resulting in
the synthesis of two distinct polyproteins: pp1a (in the absence
of frameshifting) and pp1ab (when frameshifting occurs) (Brierley et al.,
1989). This frameshift is facilitated by a specific slippery sequence
in the viral genome (5’-UUUAAAC-3’) and a downstream RNA pseudoknot
structure located just upstream of the pp1a open reading frame
(ORF) stop codon, which together induce ribosomal pausing and promote
the translation of the pp1b ORF in-frame with pp1a, thereby
producing the pp1ab polyprotein (Fehr and Perlman, 2015).
