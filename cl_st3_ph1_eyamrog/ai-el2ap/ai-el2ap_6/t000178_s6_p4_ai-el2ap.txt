The number of sequencing projects is expected to increase in
the coming months and years. For example, it is likely
that the number of SARS-CoV-2 genome submissions from Peruvian institutions
will also rise. To facilitate effective monitoring and timely updates
of this information, it is recommended that Peruvian institutions establish
a unified online platform to systematically collect, organize, and review
sequencing data.
