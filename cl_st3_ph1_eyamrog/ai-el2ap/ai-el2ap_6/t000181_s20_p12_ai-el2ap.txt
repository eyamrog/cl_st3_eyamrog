The results for the scale measuring the Attention Deficit factor
indicated significant gender differences: a higher proportion of men reported
never (20.9%) or only occasionally (29.8%) experiencing difficulty concentrating during
social isolation, while women more frequently reported experiencing such difficulties
often (19.9%) or most of the time (24.8%). These findings
may be related to the higher levels of exhaustion reported
by women during the pandemic, as well as documented cognitive
differences between genders (Regitz-Zagrosek, 2012).
