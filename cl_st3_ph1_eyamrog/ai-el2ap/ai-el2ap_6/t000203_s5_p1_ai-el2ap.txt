A published study conducted an analysis with a data cutoff
on March 21, reporting correlations between the significance of BCG
vaccination and both the incidence and lethality of COVID-19. Although
the data sources were comparable, the present study utilized initial
acceleration rates of case numbers and deaths up to April
11, as well as subsequent acceleration rates from April 11
to May 11, as illustrated in Figures 1 and 2.
