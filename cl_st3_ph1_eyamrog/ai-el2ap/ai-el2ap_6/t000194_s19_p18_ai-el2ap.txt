Conidiophores were not observed. Conidia are solitary, brown, cylindrical-fusiform, and
multi-septate, with a filiform, curved apex. Each conidium consists of
a main axis measuring 160–185 µm in length and 9–10
µm in width at the thinnest part, containing 17–19 septa.
Additionally, two lateral branches are present, which are thin, cylindrical,
light brown, measuring 65–110 × 2.0–2.5 µm, and containing 7–9
septa.
