This line of research has not yet influenced scientific production
in Ecuadorian universities, which justifies the present study as part
of a broader project aimed at generating data on cultural
habits and practices within the Ecuadorian university context. Furthermore, these
indicators not only help to characterize the student profile but
also contribute to comprehensive educational development and provide valuable information
for institutional decision-making regarding the design of cultural offerings, as
noted by Hinojosa-CÃ³rdova and Silva-Corpus (2008) and Flores et al.
(2009).
