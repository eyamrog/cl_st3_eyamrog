A study conducted by Mottola in the Autonomous Region of
the Azores, specifically on the islands of SÃ£o Miguel and
Terceira, found that the incidence rate of leptospirosis is ten
times higher compared to mainland Portugal. This increased incidence was
attributed to the region's subtropical climate, characterized by higher humidity
and average temperatures, which favor the transmission of leptospirosis. The
study also reported that the majority of cases occurred between
September and January.
