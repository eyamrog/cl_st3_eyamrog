Postoperative evaluations were conducted by two physicians: one physician, equipped
with personal protective equipment (PPE), entered the patient's room to
perform the assessment, while the second physician remained outside the
room in an area designated as "uncontaminated." This protocol was
implemented to minimize the risk of cross-contamination among healthcare personnel.
