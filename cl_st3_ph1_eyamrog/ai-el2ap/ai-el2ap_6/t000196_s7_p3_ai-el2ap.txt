Providing food is among the key functions of schools, alongside
education, socialization, and the care of children and adolescents [5].

well-being of the population. Adequate nutritional status is directly associated
with optimal growth and development during childhood, improved immune function,
reduced risk of disease, and is critical for recovery in
cases of infection [6,7].
