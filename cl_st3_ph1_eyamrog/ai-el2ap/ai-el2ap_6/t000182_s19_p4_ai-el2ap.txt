During the first 5 minutes, B. herreri oriented their walks
toward the cockroach in 78% of trials (P = 0.012),
whereas the orientation of B. corredori (65%, P = 0.169)
and B. ferroae (58%, P = 0.193) did not significantly
differ from random expectation (Fig. 2). A chi-square test of
independence indicated that the three species did not exhibit significantly
different behaviors (P = 0.501). When data from all three
species were combined (n = 56), individuals of the Belminus
genus oriented their walks toward the cockroach in 68% of
trials (P = 0.0029).
