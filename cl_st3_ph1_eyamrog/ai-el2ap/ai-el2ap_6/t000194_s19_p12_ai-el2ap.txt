The genus Isthmolongispora was first described by Matsushima (1971) based
on specimens from the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea,
including the species I. intermedia and I. minima. Isthmolongispora is
distinguished by the presence of free conidiophores and conidial chains,
with conidial cells connected by a narrow isthmus. To date,
the genus comprises nine additional species. This study represents the
first record of this species in Brazil.
