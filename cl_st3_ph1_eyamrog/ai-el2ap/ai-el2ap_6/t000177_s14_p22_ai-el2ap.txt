According to Ryan et al. [26], lamps utilizing germicidal ultraviolet
irradiation (eUVGI) reduced microbial proliferation in HVAC systems. The study
was conducted in neonatal intensive care units and within the
ventilation systems of air conditioning units. The results indicated a
reduction in microbial colonization of the trachea among patients, as
well as a decrease in antibiotic usage. The study included
the assessment of various bacteria and fungi present in the
HVAC systems, the intensive care unit environment, and among patients,
thereby providing further evidence for the effectiveness of UV radiation
in reducing microbial contamination.
