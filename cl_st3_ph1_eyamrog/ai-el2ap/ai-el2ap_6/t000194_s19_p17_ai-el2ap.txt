I. quadricellularia has been reported from two distinct biomes in
Brazil: the Atlantic Rain Forest of Ilha do Cardoso in
the southeastern state of São Paulo (as documented in this
study) and the Caatinga region in the northeastern state of
Bahia (Fiuza & Gusmão 2014). These findings indicate that the
geographical distribution of this taxon is broader than previously assumed.
This study represents the first documented occurrence of the species
in São Paulo State.
