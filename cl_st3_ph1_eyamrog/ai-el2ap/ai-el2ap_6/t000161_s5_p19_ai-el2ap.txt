Bibliometric indexes play a significant role in the scientific publishing
industry and exert considerable influence on research practices and publication
choices. Nevertheless, the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) is not a
comprehensive indicator of the development of an entire scientific field,
even when funding agencies use it as a quality criterion.
A high JIF does not necessarily reflect the quality of
taxonomic studies; rather, it is often associated with the breadth
of topics, methodological diversity, and types of data that align
with the interests of high JIF-ranked journals. Additionally, Zootaxa was
initially focused on publishing extensive papers in descriptive taxonomy but
later expanded its scope to include short notes and studies
on a broader range of topics related to zoological taxonomy
and systematics. Notably, following Clarivate’s announcement regarding the reinstatement of
Zootaxa’s JIF in September (Clarivate 2020b), the journal’s website promptly
updated its JIF, suggesting an active engagement with impact factor
metrics.
