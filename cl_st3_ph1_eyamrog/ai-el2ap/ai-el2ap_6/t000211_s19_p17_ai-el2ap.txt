Several studies have demonstrated that patients with COVID-19 exhibit a
hypercoagulable state, which suggests that the incidence of pulmonary microembolism
may be higher than currently reported. Consequently, it is possible
that pulmonary embolism is already present in a significant proportion
of patients prior to hospital admission, which may contribute to
the observed reduced efficacy of thromboprophylaxis in the inpatient setting.
