In the future, case series involving patients with multiple sclerosis
(MS) or neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) who are infected
with COVID-19 will be essential for establishing evidence-based management strategies.
Currently, clinical decision-making is primarily informed by expert opinion and
guidance. Consistent with the approach adopted by other centers, we
present our current patient care strategies during the pandemic with
the aim of supporting clinicians in our country.
