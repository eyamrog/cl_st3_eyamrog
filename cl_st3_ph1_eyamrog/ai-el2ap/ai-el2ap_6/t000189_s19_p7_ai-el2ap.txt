All studies included in this review that evaluated the impact
of vitamin D, irrespective of age, were conducted in hospitalized
patient populations. Among children, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency
ranged from 12% to 85% [17,21] and was significantly associated
with an increased risk of severe respiratory distress (OR: 5.065;
95% CI: 1.998–12.842; p<0.001) [17]. Children with serum vitamin D
levels below 20 ng/mL had a 117% higher likelihood of
requiring oxygen support and a 217% higher likelihood of needing
respiratory support [17]. Furthermore, Hurwitz et al. [21] reported that
vitamin D deficiency in pediatric patients was associated with increased
odds of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (OR: 3.29; 95%
CI: 1.20–9.02; p<0.05) and mechanical ventilation (OR: 11.2; 95% CI:
2.27–55.25; p<0.001). In studies involving hospitalized adults and older adults,
the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was between 80% and
85% [18,22]. Brance et al. [18] did not identify any
association between vitamin D status and the severity of respiratory
infection symptoms. In contrast, Kim et al. [22] found that,
after statistical adjustment, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) deficiency was associated with
an increased risk of 28-day mortality (OR: 3.31; 95% CI:
1.17–9.39; p<0.05) (see Chart 2).
