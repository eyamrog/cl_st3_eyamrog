Nations have implemented a range of interventions to mitigate the
transmission of the virus responsible for COVID-19. Measures such as
lockdowns, shelter-in-place directives, stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, and social distancing
have had significant social and economic impacts worldwide. Evidence from
a recent systematic review and meta-analysis supports the effectiveness of
maintaining a physical distance of at least one metre, the
use of face masks by both healthcare workers and the
general public, and the adoption of eye protection as strategies
to reduce viral transmission [6].
