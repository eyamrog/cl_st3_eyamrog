Conventional medical treatments primarily involve pharmaceutical drugs and psychological therapy
(53). However, alternative and complementary therapies, such as manipulative or
body-based techniques, attention-based practices, and music therapy, may serve as
important adjuncts to standard treatment and can potentially reduce the
adverse effects associated with pharmaceutical drugs (54, 55). Evidence indicates
that these therapies can assist in reducing symptoms of ADHD/ADD,
autism, anxiety, depression, and stress in children (56, 57). Numerous
studies have suggested that mindfulness-based practices, including yoga, tai chi,
qigong, and meditation, may be beneficial adjuncts in the treatment
of mental health disorders, particularly mood and anxiety disorders, and
may contribute to improved quality of life (58). Mindfulness is
defined as the intentional, accepting, and non-judgmental focus of attention
on present-moment emotions, thoughts, and sensations (59).
