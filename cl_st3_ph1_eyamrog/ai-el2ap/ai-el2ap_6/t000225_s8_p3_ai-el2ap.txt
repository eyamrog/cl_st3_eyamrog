In this study, we conduct a time-series analysis of deaths
attributed to COVID-19, referencing each death by the actual date
of occurrence rather than the date of test result confirmation.
The data series is sourced from the Civil Registry of
Brazil. Our analysis indicates that social distancing strategies (SDS) had
a significant effect in reducing the number of deaths in
SÃ£o Paulo State. Additionally, we estimate both the reduction in
mortality associated with the implementation of SDS and the level
of social distancing required to effectively halt the transmission of
the disease.
