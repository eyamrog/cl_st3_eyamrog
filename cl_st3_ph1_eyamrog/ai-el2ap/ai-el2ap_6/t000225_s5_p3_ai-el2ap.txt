The ability to monitor the temporal progression of the disease,
even with some delay, facilitates a more accurate analysis, development,
and implementation of strategies to address the epidemic. For SÃ£o
Paulo City, Table 1 presents the daily increase in deaths
alongside the corresponding social distancing index (SDI) measured 15 days
prior. These data enable a preliminary estimation of the SDI
threshold required to slow disease transmission. The analysis suggests that
an SDI between 52% and 56% represents a critical range:
an SDI of 56% is associated with a decrease of
0.40 deaths per day, while an SDI of 52% corresponds
to an increase of 0.82 deaths per day. During the
pre-intervention period (prior to March 16th), the disease advanced at
a rate of 3.18 deaths per day. However, these estimates
should be interpreted with caution, as disease transmission is influenced
by multiple factors beyond the SDI. The relationship between SDI
and viral transmission rate is not fully understood, and similar
SDI values may yield different transmission rates depending on variables
such as temperature, humidity, population density, and mask usage.
