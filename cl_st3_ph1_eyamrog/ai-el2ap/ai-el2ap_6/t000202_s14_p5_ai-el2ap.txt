The sample consisted of 438 students, selected to reflect the
gender distribution of the universityâ€™s total enrollment, which is 63%
female and 37% male. The sample was drawn from five
undergraduate programs and their respective academic cycles: Basic Education (six
cycles), Intercultural Bilingual Education (six cycles), Initial Education (six cycles),
Special Education (four cycles), and Education in Experimental Sciences (two
cycles). The number of students selected from each program was
proportional to the size of its enrolled population, resulting in
234 students from Basic Education, 78 from Initial Education, 50
from Intercultural Bilingual Education, 53 from Special Education, and 26
from Experimental Sciences.
