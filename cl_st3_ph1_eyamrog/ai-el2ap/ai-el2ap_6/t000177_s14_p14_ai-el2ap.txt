Decontamination Unit: Compact decontamination units, as illustrated in Figure 2,
can be installed either within the room or externally, where
they function by capturing indoor air and exhausting it to
the outside environment. The use of exhaust systems is particularly
important in areas with a high risk of contamination, such
as rooms designated for patients with infectious diseases.
