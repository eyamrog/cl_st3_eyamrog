The ongoing debate between Diamond Open Access (DOA), which does
not require article processing charges (APCs) from authors, and paywall-based
publishing models presents a significant challenge regarding the financial sustainability
of academic journals. Specifically, questions remain about how journals can
cover essential operational costs such as publishing, copyediting, DOI assignment,
data integration into biodiversity databases, and file archiving. These issues
have become particularly evident during the transition of major publishersâ€™
journals, such as Diversity and Distributions, from subscription-based access to
an APC-funded open access model (Peterson et al. 2019). The
prevailing trend in scientific publishing, especially in biodiversity journals, is
a shift from paywall models to gold open access (GOA),
wherein authors are responsible for publication fees (APC-GOA). This model
is advantageous for large publishers as it mitigates revenue losses
associated with unauthorized distribution through platforms such as Sci-Hub, ResearchGate,
or Academia.edu. Notably, unlike some major publishers, Zootaxa has not
requested authors to remove their work from these platforms, indicating
a different approach to the management of file sharing and
access.
