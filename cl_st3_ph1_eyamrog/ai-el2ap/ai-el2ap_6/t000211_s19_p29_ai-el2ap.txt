The Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Section of the Heart Institute
of Minneapolis implemented significant modifications to its clinical practice in
accordance with the American College of Surgeons' recommendations for elective
procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. The unit postponed all elective
procedures except those deemed essential, specifically those whose delay could
compromise patient survival or limb integrity. To facilitate the rescheduling
of postponed procedures, a database was established to track these
cases. Additionally, the majority of outpatient visits were transitioned to
telephone consultations, thereby limiting in-person review of medical records and
imaging studies to reduce potential exposure of clinical staff.
