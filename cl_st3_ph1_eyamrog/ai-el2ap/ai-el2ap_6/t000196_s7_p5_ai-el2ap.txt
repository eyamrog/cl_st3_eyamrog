It is important to note that the greater the instability
in a child's access to food—reflecting increased vulnerability of the
family in meeting basic needs—the more significant the role of
the school becomes in addressing this deficiency [5]. Furthermore, in
contexts of social vulnerability, school-provided meals function as an indirect
form of income for families, thereby contributing to the overall
household resources [10].
