The survey was conducted anonymously, and the database contained no
information that could enable the identification of participants. Therefore, this
analysis did not pose an ethical risk, as there was
no access to confidential data. Two authors (LBB and EMH)
were involved in the development of the three scales during
the survey design phase.
