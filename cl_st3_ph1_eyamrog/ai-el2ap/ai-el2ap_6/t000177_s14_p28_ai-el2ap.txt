The transmission of certain viruses within buildings can be mitigated
by adjusting air temperature and humidity levels. In isolation rooms,
vents are typically positioned at floor level, and airflow is
strictly regulated to prevent air from moving into adjacent spaces.
Studies have shown that low humidity and temperature in air-conditioned
environments can facilitate the persistence of respiratory viruses such as
SARS-CoV-2. Small viral particles can remain suspended in the air
and be transported over considerable distances by airflow within rooms
and bathrooms. Protective Environment (PE) rooms are used to house
high-risk immunocompromised patients and are designed to minimize the entry
of airborne infectious agents by maintaining positive pressure relative to
the corridor and supplying air through HEPA filtration. However, this
positive pressure differential can increase the risk of aerosolized pathogens
migrating from the patient room into the corridor when doors
are opened. While PE rooms generally protect the occupant, if
an immunocompromised patient is also infected with an airborne pathogen,
the measures intended to prevent pathogen ingress may inadvertently expose
healthcare workers, other patients, and visitors in adjacent areas. In
contrast, Airborne Infection Isolation (AII) rooms maintain negative pressure relative
to surrounding spaces and exhaust air directly outdoors to contain
aerosolized pathogens within the room. However, this negative pressure can
also increase the risk of airborne pathogens from the corridor
entering the room. Both PE and AII rooms may include
an anteroom, which serves as a buffer zone to reduce
pathogen transmission between common and protected areas and provides a
space for healthcare staff to don and doff personal protective
equipment (PPE). Although direct contact with contaminated surfaces or individuals
remains the primary mode of infection, aerosol transmission also poses
a significant risk, and masks alone may not provide complete
protection. Additionally, toilet flushing can generate aerosols that contribute to
contamination, and according to the Federation of European Heating, Ventilation
and Air Conditioning Associations (REHVA), maintaining a distance of two
meters and wearing masks may not be sufficient to prevent
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Increasing ventilation rates is therefore recommended as an
effective measure to reduce airborne particle concentrations.
