At the meso level, pandemics are associated with significant disruptions
to daily routines, separation from family and friends, school closures,
shortages of food and medicine, wage loss, and increased social
isolation resulting from quarantine or other social distancing measures. Furthermore,
fear of infection has been exacerbated by the inability of
healthcare systems to adequately respond to the Covid-19 pandemic (Choi
et al., 2020; Taylor, 2019). At the macro level, the
effects of the pandemic on cultural, political, and socioeconomic factors
are also substantial, as Covid-19 has impacted education, unemployment rates,
and the quality of work. The trajectory of these changes
remains uncertain, and it is not possible to predict when
or if a return to pre-pandemic conditions will occur (Danese
et al., 2020).
