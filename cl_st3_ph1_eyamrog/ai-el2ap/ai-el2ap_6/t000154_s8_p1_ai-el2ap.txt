Peer review became an integral component of journal publishing in
the latter half of the twentieth century, coinciding with other
major developments in scholarly communication (Baldwin, 2018; Tennant et al.,
2017; Zuckerman; Merton, 1971). In the conventional model of peer
review, editors solicit evaluations from selected reviewers to enhance the
quality of submitted manuscripts and to inform editorial decisions; this
process is not accessible to the public. Peer review is
most commonly conducted in a double-blind format, in which the
identities of both authors and reviewers are concealed from one
another. However, single-blind peer review, where reviewers are aware of
the authorsâ€™ identities but not vice versa, is prevalent in
journals based in the Global North, particularly in the natural
sciences and medicine (Pontille; Torny, 2014).
