The co-authorship analysis enabled the assessment of the strength of
scientific collaboration among authors and co-authors who produced at least
five documents, each with a minimum of ten citations; most
of these individuals constitute the Elite Group. Co-authorship analysis is
a significant bibliometric indicator and is among the most frequently
examined attributes in the application of Social Network Analysis (SNA),
as it offers researchers a comprehensive perspective on the collaborative
structures within the research community, as well as insights into
patterns of association in the scientific domain. The importance of
teamwork is underscored by the complex and interdisciplinary nature of
contemporary research, as well as the associated cost considerations.
