In the state of Pernambuco, Brazil, healthcare workers account for
approximately one-third of confirmed coronavirus cases. According to the Health
Secretariat of Pernambuco, 377 healthcare professionals have tested positive for
COVID-19, representing one out of every three cases reported in
the state. This high proportion is attributed to Pernambuco being
the first state in Brazil to implement testing for all
symptomatic healthcare workers [9].
