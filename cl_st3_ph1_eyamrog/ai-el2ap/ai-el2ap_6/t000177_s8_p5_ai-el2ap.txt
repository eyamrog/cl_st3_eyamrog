In January, Brazil had a total of 50,000 operational intensive
care unit (ICU) beds, of which only 22,000 were accessible
through the public Health Unit System (SUS), while the remaining
beds were located in hospitals that offer services exclusively through
private payment or insurance agreements. According to data reported by
Globo, 199,768 healthcare professionals were identified as suspected cases of
the disease and were consequently required to be dismissed from
their duties [8].
