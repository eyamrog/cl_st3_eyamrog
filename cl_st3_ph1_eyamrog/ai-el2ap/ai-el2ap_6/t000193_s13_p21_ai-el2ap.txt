Fingolimod use has been associated with an increased incidence of
upper and lower respiratory tract infections in patients receiving this
disease-modifying drug (DMD). In the pivotal clinical trial, lymphopenia was
a common adverse event, and lymphocyte counts were monitored monthly
during the first three months of treatment and every three
months thereafter. However, fingolimod-induced lymphopenia has not been correlated with
a higher rate of infections. It is important to note
that lymphocyte counts are not direct indicators of immunosuppression, as
fingolimod primarily causes a redistribution of lymphocytes, resulting in their
retention within lymph nodes rather than absolute lymphopenia. Based on
these considerations, laboratory monitoring should be limited to the minimum
required to reduce the risk of coronavirus infection. It is
recommended to perform a complete blood count (CBC) three months
after treatment initiation and subsequently every six months, with the
goal of maintaining lymphocyte counts above 200 cells/Î¼L.
