At Ilha do Cardoso Island, previous studies have documented the
diversity of fungi from the phyla Basidiomycota (Bononi 1979a,b,c, 1984;
Bononi et al. 1984; Bononi & Capelari 1984; Capelari 1989;
Gugliotta & Capelari 1995; Gugliotta & Bononi 1999), Glomeromycota (Trufem
et al. 1989; Trufem et al. 1994), and, more recently,
Chytridiomycota and Blastocladiomycota (Jerônimo 2014; Jerônimo et al. 2015). However,
to date, there are no records of aquatic anamorphic fungi
from this location. The primary objective of the present study
is to expand knowledge regarding the diversity of aquatic anamorphic
fungi on the island. Additionally, data on selected abiotic parameters
are provided to contribute to the historical documentation of environmental
conditions on Ilha do Cardoso.
