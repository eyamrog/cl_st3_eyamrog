The incidence ratio, calculated by dividing the incidence rates of
the groups under comparison, was used to assess differences between
the groups of interest. Mortality and lethality ratios were also
reported. To evaluate the null hypothesis that the rates are
equal between the groups, a Z-test for the comparison of
proportions was employed.
