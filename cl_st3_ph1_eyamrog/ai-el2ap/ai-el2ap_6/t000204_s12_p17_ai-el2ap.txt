As described by Dong and Bouey (29), fear and anxiety
are common psychological responses during disasters and similar situations, which
increase the vulnerability of the general population to the development
of mental disorders, particularly anxiety disorders, during such critical events.
According to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety
disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, separation anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder,
specific phobias, and selective mutism (30).
