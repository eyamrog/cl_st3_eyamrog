The values of the abiotic parameters measured in the island's
freshwater are consistent with those typically reported for the Brazilian
Atlantic Rainforest. Regarding fungal diversity, Dajoz (1973) classifies species based
on their frequency of occurrence: species with a frequency of
occurrence equal to or greater than 50% are considered constant,
those with a frequency between 25% and 50% are classified
as accessory, and those with a frequency below 25% are
regarded as occasional. This classification highlights the relationship between the
number of sampling events and the detection of different fungal
taxa.
