This study has certain limitations that should be acknowledged. First,
although participants were recruited from various regions of Brazil, the
sample cannot be considered nationally representative. Second, the majority of
respondents possessed either incomplete or complete college degrees, which does
not accurately reflect the educational distribution of the broader Brazilian
population.
