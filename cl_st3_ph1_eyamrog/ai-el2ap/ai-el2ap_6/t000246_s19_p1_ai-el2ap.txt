In this figure, application of Price's Law (references 6-8) indicates
that the proportion of variance explained by the exponential model
(R² = 0.4306) is greater than that explained by the
linear model (R² = 0.0202). These results suggest that publications
on SARS from 1989 to 2020 conform well to Price's
Law, demonstrating that the growth of scientific literature in this
research area is best characterized by an exponential model during
this period.
