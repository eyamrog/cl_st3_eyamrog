The multidisciplinary investigation of cognitive and socio-affective processes in teaching
and learning can be enhanced by applying the concept of
functional modularity, which posits that motivation, attention, and memory consist
of distinct skills and abilities mediated by separate neural modules
that operate independently yet interactively. This framework facilitates a better
understanding of how these processes contribute to the development of
learner autonomy and the management of academic activities during and
following the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, it is important to consider
the phenomenon of somatisation, wherein psychological factors may manifest as
physical symptoms.
