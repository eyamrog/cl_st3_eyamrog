Immunosuppressive therapies are currently under investigation as cytokine storm inhibitors
for adjunctive treatment in severe cases of COVID-19 infection, such
as fingolimod (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04280588). Interferons, which are disease-modifying drugs
(DMDs) used in multiple sclerosis (MS), possess antiviral properties and
are also being studied in the context of the COVID-19
pandemic (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT04343768, NCT04350671). In addition, medications commonly used
to treat neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), including tocilizumab (NCT04317092),
eculizumab (NCT04288713), and intravenous methylprednisolone (ChiCTR2000029386), are being evaluated in
patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection who present with severe pneumonia
and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Nevertheless, the potential protective
effects of MS and NMOSD DMDs against COVID-19 infection have
not yet been established. Pending further evidence, it is recommended
to discontinue DMDs in cases of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. For
moderate and mild cases, decisions regarding DMD discontinuation should be
individualized based on the specific drug safety profiles, patient age,
and the presence of comorbidities. Currently, any medication that may
interfere with the immune response cannot be regarded as completely
safe in symptomatic patients.
