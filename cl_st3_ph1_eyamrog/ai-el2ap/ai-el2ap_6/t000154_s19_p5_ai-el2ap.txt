The other core trait, open reports, received support that most
closely aligned with overall agreement regarding open peer review, both
in terms of stakeholders' beliefs that it would improve the
peer review process (Table 3) and their agreement that it
would provide useful information to readers and enhance the quality
of reviewer reports (Table 4). However, a comparable proportion of
participants expressed concerns that open reports might discourage reviewers from
providing strong criticism or from agreeing to participate in the
review process.
