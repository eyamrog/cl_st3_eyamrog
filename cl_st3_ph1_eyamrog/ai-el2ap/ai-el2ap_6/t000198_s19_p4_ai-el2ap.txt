The period of enforced isolation had a significant impact on
dental students at the University of Pittsburgh. U.S. dental students
are generally older than their counterparts in Brazil, with an
average age difference of approximately four years, which contributes to
a greater financial investment in their education. The total cost
of the dental program at the University of Pittsburgh is
approximately US$300,000. Consequently, the transition to remote learning modalities to
complete the semester due to COVID-19 was associated with increased
levels of anxiety among students. Online instruction was supplemented with
additional opportunities for guidance and emotional support. In addition to
teaching, other aspects of the academic experience, such as research
and service activities, were also substantially affected.
