The inclusion of Network professionals within health systems increases the
likelihood that these individuals will be influenced by their peers,
particularly through the actions, opinions, and public statements of colleagues
who provide abortion services. This dynamic can produce a symbolic
effect within institutions and health teams, as well as at
the community level, due to the increased visibility of these
professionals. Additionally, efforts are made to influence public opinion regarding
the legitimacy of the demand for Legal Interruption of Pregnancy.
