Chloroquine (CQ) has been evaluated for its activity against SARS-CoV.
It induces alkalinization of acidic vesicles in cells infected by
intracellular pathogens (Rolain et al. 2007) and was developed as
an alternative to quinine for malaria treatment. Both CQ and
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been investigated for their effects on viral
hepatitis (Pareja‚ÄêCoronel 1963), dengue virus (Farias et al. 2015), HIV
(Paton et al. 2002), and other viruses, as well as
on various intracellular bacteria, including Coxiella burnetii and Tropheryma whipplei,
bacteria-like organisms such as Legionella pneumophila and Mycobacterium species, and
fungal pathogens such as Histoplasma capsulatum and Cryptococcus neoformans (Rolain
et al. 2007). CQ demonstrates antiviral activity in Vero E6
and Huh7 cells infected with MERS-CoV (De Wilde et al.
2014), but not in dendritic cells or monocyte-derived macrophages (Cong
et al. 2018). In vitro, CQ is effective against SARS-CoV
when administered either before or after viral exposure, interfering with
ACE2 glycosylation and inhibiting viral binding (Keyaerts et al. 2004;
Vincent et al. 2005). Additionally, CQ alters endosomal pH, which
inhibits viral infection (Simmons et al. 2004).
