A study conducted by researchers from the United Kingdom projected
various pandemic scenarios in 202 countries up to the epidemiological
week ending April 26, 2020, by proposing three models based
on different mitigation strategies: (1) no mitigation interventions, meaning the
absence of non-pharmacological measures such as social distancing; (2) implementation
of social distancing for the entire population; and (3) enhanced
social distancing specifically for the elderly. Depending on the mitigation
strategy employed, the estimated total number of COVID-19 cases in
Brazil would be 187,799,806, 122,025,818, and 120,836,850, respectively. The corresponding
projected numbers of deaths were 1,152,283 for the first scenario,
627,047 for the second, and 529,779 for the third. The
report concluded that interventions such as social isolation, school closures,
and the suspension of non-essential services could prevent millions of
deaths.
