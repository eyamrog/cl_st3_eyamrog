The first case of COVID-19 was reported in December 2019
in Wuhan, China [2]. In Brazil, the initial cases were
documented in February 2020 [3]. To mitigate the spread of
the pandemic, social distancing was widely implemented as a non-pharmaceutical
intervention. Additional measures included the closure of educational institutions at
all levels, as well as the suspension of operations in
restaurants, offices, and commercial establishments, among other actions.
