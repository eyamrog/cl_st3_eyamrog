Aquatic anamorphs are recognized as a significant ecological group of
fungi involved in the decomposition of submerged leaf litter, either
by directly consuming the material or by enhancing its nutritional
quality for other organisms in the trophic chain, such as
shredding invertebrates (Bärlocher 1992; Cheng et al. 1997; Suberkropp 1992,
2003). Consequently, these fungi are considered to play a crucial
role in nutrient cycling within aquatic ecosystems (Belliveau & Bärlocher
2005).
