Researchers choose to publish in Zootaxa for several reasons related
to the journal’s characteristics and policies. Key factors influencing journal
selection include scope, visibility, field-specific prestige, and Journal Impact Factor
(JIF). Zootaxa is particularly attractive to authors seeking rapid peer
review and publication, no article processing charges (APC), a relatively
high JIF, and no restrictions on manuscript length. The majority
of authors and readers appear unconcerned about the journal’s hybrid
access model, in which most articles are paywalled and only
a minority are available as gold open access (GOA) through
APC payment. This acceptance may be attributed to the high
APCs charged by most open access journals, which can be
prohibitive for researchers from developing countries or those with limited
funding, such as many Brazilian contributors who constitute a significant
proportion of Zootaxa’s authorship (https://bit.ly/2Y0hSQ9). Additionally, open access to articles
is often achieved through self-archiving platforms like ResearchGate or through
unauthorized sources such as Sci-Hub, which provides paywalled content without
regard for copyright and is widely considered illegal. The high
cost of APCs presents a significant barrier for researchers from
less affluent countries and small research groups, who must prioritize
limited research funds. However, reliance on platforms like Sci-Hub raises
ethical and legal concerns regarding intellectual property rights. Consequently, there
is a degree of controversy in the preference for hybrid
journals, as some authors oppose paying APCs for open access
but support hybrid models partly because paywalled content can be
accessed through unauthorized means.
