As indicated in its foundational charter (Carta Pública 2015), the
Network’s approach differs significantly from that of the medical establishment
or hegemonic medicine, proposing alternative frameworks for understanding abortion as
a health issue. Consequently, the Network aims to implement new
practices with the objective of integrating them into the institutional
culture as standard procedures. However, the process of establishing what
is considered normal within an institution is complex and represents
a significant challenge for the Network. Notably, the Network has
facilitated a sense of community among its members, enabling individuals
to recognize shared experiences and perspectives.
