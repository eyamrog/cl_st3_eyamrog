Despite the provision of support to students through prepared meals,
meal kits, or financial aid, several issues remain to be

intended student recipients, evaluating the nutritional quality and quantity of
food provided in meal kits, and identifying potential challenges that
families may encounter in accessing the benefits and preparing the
food.
