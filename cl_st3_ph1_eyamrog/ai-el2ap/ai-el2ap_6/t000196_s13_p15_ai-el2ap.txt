For example, during the H1N1 outbreak, school closures were implemented
as a non-pharmaceutical containment measure and were reported to contribute
to a reduction in disease transmission [17]. In Brazil in
2009, however, only a limited number of states delayed the
resumption of classes by 15 days at the start of
the second semester [18], and there were no prolonged school
closures comparable to those enacted in 2020.
