STAT3 modulation is a key factor in both pro-inflammatory and
anti-inflammatory responses. SARS-CoV PLpro has been shown to activate TGF-β1
via the p38MAPK/ERK1-2 pathway, which in turn promotes STAT3 activation
(Li et al. 2016). Additionally, MERS-CoV strains harboring mutations in
NSP3 and ORF4a exhibit altered STAT3 activation and distinct profiles
of inflammatory cytokine expression (Selinger et al. 2014). During SARS-CoV
infection, there is a reduction in IL-4, which is involved
in humoral immunity, an increase in IFN-γ, which contributes to
cell-mediated immune responses, and an elevation of IL-10, which is
associated with increased disease susceptibility (Zhu 2004).
