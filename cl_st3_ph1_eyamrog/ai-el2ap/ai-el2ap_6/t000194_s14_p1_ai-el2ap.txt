Sampling was conducted in the State Park of Ilha do
Cardoso (PEIC), which is situated on Ilha do Cardoso, located
on the southeastern coast of São Paulo State, Brazil (25º03'05"–25º18'18"S
and 47º53'48"–48º05'42"W). The park encompasses a total area of 22,500
hectares and contains a variety of environments, including primary and
secondary Atlantic rainforest, dunes, mangroves, sandbank formations, and a major
watercourse, the Perequê River, which traverses most of the island.
Additionally, the area features numerous small ponds, tributaries, river rapids,
waterfalls, and brooks (Secretaria de Estado do Meio Ambiente, 1998).
