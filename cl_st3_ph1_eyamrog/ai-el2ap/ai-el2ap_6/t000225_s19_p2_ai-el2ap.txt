Three distinct trends in the daily number of COVID-19-attributed deaths
are observable in Figure 1. From March 17th to April
5th, there is a marked increase in reported deaths, with
an average rate of approximately 5.2 deaths per day. This
is followed by a plateau in the number of deaths
until April 19th, after which a second increase is observed.
The analysis is limited to data up to April 27th
due to a potential 14-day delay between the occurrence of
death and the consolidation of information on the reporting website;
consequently, more recent data were not available at the time
of manuscript completion.
