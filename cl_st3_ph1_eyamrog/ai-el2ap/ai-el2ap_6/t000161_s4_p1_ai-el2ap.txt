Threats to taxonomy as a scientific discipline originate from multiple
sources, and the relatively low bibliometric indicators of its journals
represent only one aspect contributing to the so-called taxonomic impediment.
While Clarivate operates as a for-profit entity, publishers such as
Magnolia Press Ltd. and similar organizations are also not nonprofit
non-governmental organizations. The reinstatement of Zootaxa by Clarivate is of
limited significance to biological sciences and taxonomy, as Journal Impact
Factors have been criticized for their lack of statistical validity
(Curry 2012) and their detrimental effects on scientific progress. Therefore,
this reinstatement should not be interpreted by taxonomists as a
substantive advancement for the discipline. The taxonomic community should critically
assess and avoid supporting bibliometric policies that are demonstrably more
harmful than beneficial to the field.
