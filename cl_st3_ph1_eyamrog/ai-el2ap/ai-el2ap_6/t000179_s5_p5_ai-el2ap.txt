The three instruments employed in this study enable the collection
of data on various dimensions of physician job satisfaction, taking
into account the specific characteristics of the health system in
a middle-income country. For instance, the general professional activity scale
includes an item (c2p82_3) that measures physicians’ willingness to work
as care staff in additional institutions, which is relevant given
that approximately half of physicians in Peru are employed at
more than one institution. The Health Services Management scale contains
items that evaluate satisfaction with the management of rotating shifts
(item c2p83_5) and drug management (item c2p83_2). Notably, a review
of the literature did not identify any existing scales that
assess satisfaction with the management of health centres. Additionally, the
working conditions scale assesses satisfaction with one’s position within the
institution (item c2p81_6) and with the provision of basic services
such as water supply and drainage (item c2p81_11).
