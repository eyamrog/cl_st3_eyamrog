Peru is recognized as one of the most biodiverse countries
globally. Genetic diversity constitutes a fundamental aspect of biodiversity and
is essential for the effective conservation and sustainable management of
various organisms and habitats. To date, only one study has
described Peruvian genetic data available in public databases. The present
study aims to update this information by systematically searching four
public databases that store sequencing data: Nucleotide, BioProject, PATRIC, and
BOLD. Based on these data, we assess the contribution of
Peruvian institutions in recent years. In the Nucleotide database, which
is the largest among those examined, bacteria represent the majority
of sequences submitted by Peruvian institutions (70.60%), with pathogenic species
such as Pasteurella multocida, Neisseria meningitidis, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus being
the most frequently recorded. No sequence records from the Archaea
domain were identified. In BioProject, the most common sequence corresponds
to Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Infantis. In PATRIC, a
database dedicated to pathogenic agents, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Yersinia pestis
had the highest number of entries. In BOLD, which exclusively
contains eukaryotic data, the most frequent records were from Chordata
(Aves and Actinopterygii), Angiospermae, and Arthropoda (Insecta and Arachnida). These
findings suggest that Peruvian research institutions predominantly focus on infectious
diseases. Although there has been a notable increase in the
volume of DNA data submitted by Peruvian institutions since the
previous report, the genetic diversity represented in these databases does
not fully reflect the countryâ€™s overall biodiversity. Additional efforts are
required to obtain genetic information from underrepresented taxonomic groups and
to encourage broader participation in genetic research by regional Peruvian
institutions.
