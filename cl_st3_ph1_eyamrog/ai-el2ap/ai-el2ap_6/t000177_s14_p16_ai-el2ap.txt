Elias et al. [21] demonstrated that in hospitals equipped with
HEPA filtration, the use of localized air filters in high-traffic
areas can further reduce the concentration of viral particles. A
low-cost air purifier with a HEPA filter, priced at approximately
$100, is capable of exchanging the air in a 15
mÂ² room five times per hour and could be implemented
on a large scale in hospital settings. Additionally, increasing the
airflow rate in existing HVAC systems and minimizing the recirculation
of air between rooms may further enhance infection control.
