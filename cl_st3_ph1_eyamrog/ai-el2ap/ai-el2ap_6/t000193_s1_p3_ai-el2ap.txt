Methods: This study addresses the following areas: 1) strategies to
reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection, including the implementation of
social distancing measures, the use of telemedicine, and increasing the
intervals between laboratory testing and imaging; 2) approaches to relapse
management, such as avoiding treatment for mild relapses and utilizing
oral corticosteroids when appropriate; 3) management of disease-modifying therapies, with
a preference for agents associated with a lower risk of
infection (including interferons, glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide, and natalizumab), and consideration
of extended-interval dosing of natalizumab when clinically justified; 4) individualization
of induction therapy for multiple sclerosis, specifically with anti-CD20 monoclonal
antibodies, alemtuzumab, and cladribine; 5) management of preventive therapies for
neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), encompassing both initial therapy selection
and ongoing treatment maintenance; and 6) management of patients with
multiple sclerosis or NMOSD who are infected with COVID-19.
