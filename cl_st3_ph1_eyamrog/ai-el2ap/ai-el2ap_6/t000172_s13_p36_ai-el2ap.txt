Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have demonstrated some in vivo
activity against SARS-CoV-2 (Wang et al. 2020b). A group of
Chinese researchers has reported potential therapeutic benefits of chloroquine in
the treatment of COVID-19, although supporting data have not yet
been published (Gao et al. 2020). Additionally, a French research
group observed that hydroxychloroquine reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in a
small cohort of patients, and the concomitant use of azithromycin
appeared to enhance this effect (Gautret et al. 2020). A
recent review of ongoing clinical trials highlighted inconsistent findings, with
some studies reporting beneficial outcomes while others raised concerns regarding
toxicity (Sharma 2020). It is also relevant to note the
existence of different circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2 (Wang et al.
2020a). Furthermore, CQ exhibits pro-apoptotic properties, and its prophylactic use
has been associated with the selection of intracellular pathogen strains
that increase resistance to apoptosis and lethality, as previously observed
in HIV and SARS-CoV infections (Parris 2004). Despite the low
cost of CQ, major health agencies, including the World Health
Organization, agree that additional research is required to establish the
clinical efficacy and safety of CQ and HCQ for COVID-19
treatment. As of now, 390 clinical trials involving HCQ or
CQ are registered to further investigate their potential role in
the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register).
