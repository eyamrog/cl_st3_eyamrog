Triatomines constitute a well-defined taxonomic group within the Reduviidae family
(Schaefer 2005). They are classified into five tribes and fifteen
genera, comprising approximately 150 described species, the majority of which
are endemic to the Americas (Otálora-Luna et al. 2015). Triatomines
possess distinct behavioral and morphological characteristics that differentiate them from
most other Reduviidae (assassin bugs). Notably, triatomines are structurally adapted
for hematophagy; however, as will be discussed later, not all
species are obligate blood feeders. The Reduviidae family itself is
atypical within the order Hemiptera, as most reduviids are terrestrial
predators of other arthropods, whereas most predatory Hemiptera are aquatic.
It is generally accepted that triatomines evolved from primitive zoophagous
reduviids (Cobben 1979), but there is ongoing debate regarding whether
this evolutionary transition occurred once (monophyletic hypothesis) or multiple times
(polyphyletic hypothesis) (Otálora-Luna et al. 2015). Schaefer (2005) emphasized the
importance of understanding phylogenetic relationships to gain insights into the
subfamily Triatominae, noting that there is substantial consistency among behavioral,
physiological, and morphological traits associated with the triatomine lifestyle to
consider them a monophyletic or paraphyletic group. Nevertheless, taxonomic studies
of Triatominae have traditionally prioritized morphological traits over behavioral patterns
(Lent and Wygodzinsky 1979; Páez-Rondón et al. 2019). In some
instances, taxonomic groups cannot be distinguished based solely on morphological
features (Hutchinson 1965), yet even morphologically similar species often exhibit
distinct behavioral differences (Imanishi 2011). According to Imanishi, ethological studies
can aid in differentiating taxonomic groups. Although behavior is not
a typical phenotypic trait, as not all behavioral characteristics are
heritable, a significant proportion of behavior—specifically, instinctive behaviors—can be considered
part of the triatomine phenotype and can be reliably measured
under controlled observational conditions in accordance with ethological principles. Lorenz
(1966) proposed that “coordination of movements” or “phylogenetically adapted motor
patterns” are characteristic of species and that the concept of
homology applies to these behaviors as it does to morphological
traits. The present study adopts this ethological framework, aiming to
elucidate phylogenetic relationships within the subfamily Triatominae by describing behavioral
characters. The identification of a behavioral pattern unique to Triatominae
(an autapomorphy) guided the experimental approach, with the genus Belminus
selected as a model to identify ethological features indicative of
phylogenetic relationships.
