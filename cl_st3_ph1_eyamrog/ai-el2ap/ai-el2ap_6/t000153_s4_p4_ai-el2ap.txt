This article highlights the necessity of conducting research to analyze
the outcomes of the local alliance formed between feminist organizations,
other grassroots groups, and health care providers committed to sexual
and reproductive rights. The establishment of this network resulted from
an initiative led by feminist activists who had already begun
collaborating with health professionals, based on the conviction that their
inclusion was essential for effecting immediate changes in the conditions
surrounding the provision of non-punishable abortions. Some sectors of local
activism maintain that achieving social legitimacy for the demand for
legal abortion is unlikely if health professionals are excluded from
these efforts. Although the formation of such coalitions does not
resolve the issue of clandestine abortion in the country, it
represents a gradual process of change that is reflected in
the lived experiences of women. Furthermore, these coalitions contribute to
promoting cultural change related to abortion practices.
