As demonstrated by this example, proficiency in English has been
linked to improved employment prospects and greater access to knowledge,
largely because the most current scientific and academic information is
available in English. As a result, the Ecuadorian education system
has prioritized English as a Foreign Language (EFL) instruction for
several years, incorporating English as a significant component of the
curriculum in both primary and secondary education.
