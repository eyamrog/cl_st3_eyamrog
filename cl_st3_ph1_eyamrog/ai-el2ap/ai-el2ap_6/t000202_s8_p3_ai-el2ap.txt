From a different analytical perspective, there exists a substantial body
of literature on cultural topics that draws on both theoretical-methodological
frameworks and empirical research, including the foundational work of the
Center for Contemporary Cultural Studies in Birmingham and the studies
conducted by Bourdieu. In the context of Latin American social
studies, the contributions of Canclini (2006) and Sunkel (2006), among
others, are particularly noteworthy.
