To evaluate the factor structures, three criteria were applied. First,
item factor loadings were required to be equal to or
greater than 0.40 (20). Second, for scales with multiple dimensions,
each dimension was required to include at least three items
to ensure stability (25). Third, items that loaded on more
than one dimension with a difference in loadings of less
than 0.020 were excluded. Conversely, if the difference in loadings
was equal to or greater than 0.20, the item was
retained in the dimension with the highest factor loading (20).
