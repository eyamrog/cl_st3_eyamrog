Graphic organizers are instructional tools designed to facilitate readersâ€™ comprehension
of textual content, and their effectiveness has been the subject
of empirical research for more than three decades (Wills &
Ellis, 2008, p. 1). They are defined as visual representations
of information contained within a text and are employed with
learners to support the development of reading comprehension skills (Jiang
& Grabe, 2007, p. 34).
