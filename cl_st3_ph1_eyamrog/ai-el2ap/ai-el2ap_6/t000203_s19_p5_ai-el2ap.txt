Tables 3, 4, and 5 present the descriptive statistics for
acceleration per inhabitant in the interest groups, as well as
the results of the statistical tests comparing these groups. Table
4 displays the comparison between groups 2.1 and 2.2. The
results indicate a statistically significant difference in acceleration over the
last 30 days for both cases (p = 0.008) and
deaths (p = 0.001), with group 2.1 exhibiting higher mean
and median acceleration values than group 2.2. In contrast, when
comparing the acceleration up to April 11 in group 2.1
with the acceleration up to May 11 in group 2.2,
there is no statistically significant difference in the acceleration of
cases (p = 0.284). However, a significant difference is observed
in the acceleration of deaths (p = 0.001), with group
2.1 showing higher acceleration.
