Table 5 presents the results of the comparison between groups
3.1 and 3.2. Consistent with the findings reported in Table
4, there is statistical evidence of a difference between the
groups in terms of acceleration over the last 30 days
for both cases (p = 0.003) and deaths (p =
0.001), with group 3.1 exhibiting higher mean and median acceleration
values than group 3.2. In the comparison of acceleration up
to April 11 in group 3.1 versus acceleration up to
May 11 in group 3.2, a statistically significant difference was
observed only for the acceleration of deaths (p = 0.001),
with group 3.1 demonstrating higher acceleration than group 3.2.
