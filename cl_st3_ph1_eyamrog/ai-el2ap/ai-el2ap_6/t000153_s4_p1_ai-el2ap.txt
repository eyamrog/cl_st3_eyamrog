Throughout this study, we aimed to characterize the practices adopted
by members of the “Network of Healthcare Professionals for the
Right to Decide” in general terms. Specifically, our research investigated,
from the perspective of these professionals, the principal changes they
have observed in their perceptions of abortion-related stigma since joining
the organization.
