Invariance was established across both scales with respect to sex,
age groups, marital status, possession of a specialty, employment at
another institution, duration of employment, and the presence of work-related
or chronic diseases (see Supplement 3). Consequently, comparisons between these
groups using each scale are considered valid. However, invariance could
not be assessed for type of organization and monthly income
due to unmet statistical assumptions.
