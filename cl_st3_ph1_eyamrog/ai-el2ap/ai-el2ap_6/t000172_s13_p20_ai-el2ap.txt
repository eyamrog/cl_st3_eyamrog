In addition to pp1ab, S, E, M, and N proteins,
SARS-CoV-2 encodes at least five additional open reading frames (ORFs),
designated ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a/7b, ORF8, and ORF10, for which the
molecular mechanisms of action in the viral replication cycle remain
largely uncharacterized. Previous studies have reported that SARS-CoV ORF3a interacts
with TRAF3 and ASC, facilitating TRAF3 ubiquitination and activation of
the NLRP3 inflammasome (Siu et al., 2019). Additional research has
demonstrated that ORF3a exhibits binding affinities for caveolin-1 and calcium
(Padhan et al., 2007; Minakshi et al., 2014). SARS-CoV ORF6
has been localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membranes
in infected cells, where it binds to karyopherin alpha 2
and karyopherin beta 1, thereby inhibiting STAT1 nuclear import and
its associated functions (Frieman et al., 2007). Furthermore, evidence indicates
that nsp8 interacts with ORF6, suggesting a potential role for
the ORF6 protein in viral replication (Kumar et al., 2007).
