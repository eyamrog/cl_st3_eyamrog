Evidence of internal structure for the scales was identified through
exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The results indicate that both
the professional activity satisfaction scale and the health center management
scale are unidimensional, meaning that all items within each scale
can be summed to produce an overall score (23). In
contrast, the satisfaction with working conditions scale demonstrated a two-dimensional
structure, comprising individual and structural dimensions, which allows for the
calculation of separate scores for each dimension (23).
