Airborne transmission of pathogens occurs via droplets and aerosols that
are commonly produced by activities such as coughing, sneezing, shouting,
breathing, toilet flushing, and certain medical procedures. While ventilation systems
are generally ineffective at preventing the rapid settling of large
droplets, they can affect the distribution and transmission of infectious
aerosols, including droplet nuclei. The implementation of directional airflow can
establish clean-to-dirty flow patterns, thereby facilitating the removal of infectious
aerosols through exhaust systems [12, 13].
