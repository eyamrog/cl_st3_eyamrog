During the pandemic, there was significant collaboration among key dental
regulatory bodies, including the Australian Dental Association (ADA), the Dental
Board of Australia (DBA), and the Australian Council of Dental
Schools (ACODS). The ADA implemented a staged system of restrictions,
which was endorsed by the other organizations and supported by
both State and Federal Governments [19]. These restrictions were categorized
from level 1 to level 5, with level 3 maintained
throughout March and April. Under level 3, only dental emergencies—such
as the management of infections, pain, and bleeding—were permitted, and
procedures involving aerosols were prohibited (Table 1). During this period,
the School operated with a minimal roster consisting solely of
clinical dentists and academic staff, excluding students. In late April,
the government authorized a reduction to ADA level 2 restrictions,
and by the end of May, restrictions were further reduced
to level 1. Although these regulations applied to all dental
practitioners nationwide, dental schools have only recently begun implementing their
“return to clinic” strategies, with most institutions initially operating under
level 2 restrictions [20].
