A random subset of the total sample was analyzed using
the split-half method (20, 21). Polychoric correlation matrices were employed
(22), and the weighted least squares means and variance adjusted
(WLSMV) estimator was applied, as it is most appropriate for
ordinal data. To determine the optimal number of dimensions, quartimin
rotation, parallel analysis, and Kaiserâ€™s criterion were utilized (24). Multiple
models were generated and assessed to identify the one with
the most favorable measurement properties, in accordance with theoretical frameworks
that conceptualize job satisfaction as a multidimensional construct. Prior to
conducting exploratory factor analysis, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) statistic was calculated
to assess sampling adequacy and ensure sufficient statistical power for
the analysis. KMO values greater than 0.90 were considered indicative
of adequate sample adequacy (22).
