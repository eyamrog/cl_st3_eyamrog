REHVA has demonstrated that flushing toilets with open lids generates
plumes containing droplets and droplet residues. Recent scientific studies and
reports from Chinese authorities have detected SARS-CoV-2 in stool samples.
Therefore, exhaust ventilation systems in toilets should be operated continuously
to maintain negative pressure, which is particularly important for reducing
the risk of fecal-oral transmission, as illustrated in Figure X.
