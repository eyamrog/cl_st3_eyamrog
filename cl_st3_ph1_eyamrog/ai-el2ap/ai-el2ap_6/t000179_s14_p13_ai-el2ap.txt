The satisfaction scale for assessing the working conditions at the
health center is designed to evaluate health professionalsâ€™ perceptions of
their work environment. The scale includes indicators such as satisfaction
with opportunities for promotion, organizational structure of the health center,
workload, work schedules, salary, professional development opportunities, infrastructure and equipment,
relationships with superiors, administrative procedures, and hygiene within the health
center. In the ENSUSALUD survey, the items corresponding to this
instrument are included in question 81, with codes ranging from
c2p81_1 to c2p81_16 (see Supplement 1).
