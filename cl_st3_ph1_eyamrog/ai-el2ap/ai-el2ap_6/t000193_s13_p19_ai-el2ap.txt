In patients exhibiting persistent MOG IgG positivity and a clinical
phenotype consistent with NMOSD, we recommend employing the same management
strategy, utilizing rituximab as a first-line treatment, particularly in the
context of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is important to
note that patients with MOG antibody-associated disease may not demonstrate
the same efficacy profile in response to rituximab as those
who are AQP4-positive.
