Reynolds et al. (11) reported that social isolation may be
associated with the emergence of various psychopathological symptoms, including depressed
mood, irritability, anxiety, fear, anger, and insomnia, which can have
long-term consequences for mental health. Similarly, Hawryluck et al. (12)
found that even three years after a period of isolation,
individuals exhibited an increased risk of alcohol abuse as well
as symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.
