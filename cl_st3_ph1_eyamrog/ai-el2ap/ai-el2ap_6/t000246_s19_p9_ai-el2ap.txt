The 1,623 SARS-related documents were published across 532 different journals.
Application of Bradfordâ€™s Law identified 15 journals in the core,
86 journals in zone 1, and 532 journals in zone
2. Tables 1 and 2 display the distribution of journals
and their respective publication output across the nucleus and the
two zones, as well as the calculated values of the
Bradford Multiplier (Bm). The Bradford Multiplier was used to demonstrate
that the number of journals in the nucleus corresponds to
those most dedicated to SARS research, as its variation between
zones did not exceed the maximum value of 0.7.
