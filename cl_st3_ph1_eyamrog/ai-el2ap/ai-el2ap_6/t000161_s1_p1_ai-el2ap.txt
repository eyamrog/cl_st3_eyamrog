Taxonomy is a fundamental discipline within the biological sciences and
should be prioritized in response to the current biodiversity crisis.
The widespread reliance on bibliometric indices by the scientific publishing
industry has led to distortions affecting institutions, organizations, and researchers,
exemplified by the phenomenon often referred to as Journal Impact
Factor (JIF) mania. The limitations of widely used bibliometric indices,
such as those provided by Clarivate™ (InCites™) and RELX™ Elsevier
B.V. (Scopus®), have been identified as impediments to the advancement
of taxonomic research. Recently, Clarivate removed the mega-journal Zootaxa, which
specializes in taxonomy, from the Journal Citation Reports (JCR), a
database comprising 12,000 periodicals, due to an unusually high proportion
of self-citations—a criterion that also led to the suppression of
32 other journals. As a result, these journals did not
receive a JIF for 2020. The scientific community responded promptly
to Zootaxa’s suppression, leading Clarivate to reinstate the journal. This
incident highlighted persistent misconceptions and misapplications of bibliometric indices. The
objective of this study is to analyze the impacts of
bibliometric indices on the field of taxonomy and to examine
the circumstances surrounding the suppression of Zootaxa. Specifically, we investigate
whether the removal of a journal from JIF calculations can
significantly affect taxonomic research output. We analyzed JCR (Web of
Science Core Collection™) data from 2010 to 2018 for the
top ten zoological journals (eight of which are included in
JCR) in terms of the number of new taxa described,
as well as 123 journals that focus on or regularly
publish taxonomic studies. Zootaxa exhibits higher levels of self-citation compared
to similar journals. We argue that the commonly cited explanations
for this pattern—namely, Zootaxa’s taxonomic focus and its status as
a mega-journal—are insufficient. Instead, we propose that the so-called “Zootaxa
phenomenon” is driven by sociological factors, including increased visibility and
prevailing misconceptions that position Zootaxa as the primary venue for
taxonomic publications with a favorable JIF. Threats to taxonomy arise
from multiple sources, and the relatively low bibliometric values of
taxonomic journals represent only one aspect of the broader taxonomic
impediment. We recommend the rejection of bibliometric indices, including JIF,
as evaluative tools for taxonomic research, rather than their selective
use when advantageous. The taxonomic community should prioritize activities that
directly advance and promote the discipline, rather than focusing on
journal metrics or acquiescing to bibliometric policies established by dominant
publishing companies.
