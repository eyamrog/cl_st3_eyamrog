Low reading comprehension is often associated with a limited use
of reading strategies, which in turn may result in reduced
vocabulary acquisition. If students encounter these challenges in their first
language (L1), it is likely that the reading process becomes
even more complex for them in English as a second
language. Consistent with this expectation, the pre-test results, as presented
in Table N.2, indicate low performance percentages among the participants.
