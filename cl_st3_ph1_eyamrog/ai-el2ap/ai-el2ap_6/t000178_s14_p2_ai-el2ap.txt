BioProject data were retrieved using Entrez Direct with the command
<esearch -db BioProject -query "Peru" | efetch -format xml |
xtract -pattern DocumentSummary -element Project \ -block Organism -element OrganismName
Supergroup \ -block Submission -element Name > BioProject.xml> and subsequently
processed using awk scripts. Data from BOLD and PATRIC were
obtained directly from their respective websites by searching for the
term “Peru,” and were downloaded in tabular (tsv) and comma-separated
(csv) formats, respectively. For both datasets, cat was used to
concatenate text files, and grep -c was employed to count
the occurrences of specific word queries. Additionally, awk scripts were
applied to the BOLD dataset to group and count the
most frequently sequenced taxonomic orders by institution, while csvgrep was
used for the PATRIC dataset to count sequenced organisms per
institution. All code and scripts used in this study are
available at https://github.com/reymonera/mining_peru_sequence_DB. Finally, the Scopus reference database (https://www.scopus.com) was
searched for records containing the term “genetic diversity” that were
produced by at least one Peruvian institution.
