Urgent cases involving hemodynamically stable patients with confirmed or suspected
COVID-19 from peripheral hospitals were centralized to a dedicated COVID-19
Surgical Sector. This sector was established by isolating a specific
wing from other operational areas and converting it into an
operating room and intensive care unit beds, along with the
creation of an emergency transfer area equipped with an exclusive
elevator.
