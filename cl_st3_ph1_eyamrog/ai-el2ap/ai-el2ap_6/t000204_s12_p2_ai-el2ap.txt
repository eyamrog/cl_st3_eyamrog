The potential for viral transmission to the brain following intranasal
infection may occur via synaptic connections within the sensory system
and through neurotropism (5). In this context, coronavirus infection may
adversely impact the teaching-learning process by impairing both educators and
learners, who may experience a range of negative emotions that
influence mood and behavioral skills when processing information related to
COVID-19.
