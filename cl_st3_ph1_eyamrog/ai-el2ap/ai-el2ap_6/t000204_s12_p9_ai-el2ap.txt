During a pandemic, fear contributes to elevated levels of anxiety
and stress in healthy individuals and exacerbates symptoms in those
with pre-existing psychiatric disorders (15). However, there is limited knowledge
regarding the specific impact of fear of infectious disease on
individuals' psychological responses. In China, the initial epicenter of the
current pandemic, high rates of depression, post-traumatic stress, anxiety, and
insomnia have been reported among health professionals (16, 17) as
well as among patients infected with COVID-19 (18). Nevertheless, the
degree to which these psychological conditions are directly attributable to
anxiety related to coronavirus infection remains unclear.
