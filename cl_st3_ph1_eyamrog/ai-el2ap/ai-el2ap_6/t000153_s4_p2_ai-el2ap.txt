These reports demonstrate that it is possible to counteract the
effects of stigmatization by adopting an active approach to professional
identity. This approach has resulted in increased opportunities for women
and girls to receive support from a Network professional when
accessing non-punishable abortion services in public institutions. Furthermore, this active
engagement has facilitated the provision of pre- and post-abortion counseling
sessions in numerous healthcare centers nationwide.
