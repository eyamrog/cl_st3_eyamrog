The response to the pandemic was initially delayed; however, once
implemented, colleges and universities in the United States suspended classes
for one week. In the subsequent week, instructional activities transitioned
to virtual platforms, utilizing a combination of recorded lectures and
synchronous sessions involving both faculty and students. At the School
of Dental Medicine, all research activities were suspended, except for
projects deemed essential to the COVID-19 response or those that
could not be interrupted due to the use of unique
materials or supplies. Administrative functions, including meetings, were conducted entirely
online. All elective patient care was postponed to protect staff
and conserve personal protective equipment (PPE) and other clinical supplies.
Urgent dental cases were managed through teledentistry consultations until national
guidelines were issued by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention [18]. These cases were subsequently addressed within weeks, following
the release of national protocols for urgent care (Table 1).
