The Network is continuously expanding, thereby increasing its territorial presence.
The broad geographical distribution of its members is a critical
factor in ensuring that access to abortion services is genuinely
federal. In certain instances, Network members operate in rural areas,
remote locations, and indigenous or campesino communities, where the provision
of Legal Interruption of Pregnancy services through public institutions has
significant symbolic impact within the community.
