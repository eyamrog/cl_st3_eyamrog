Páez-Rondón et al. (2018) exposed R. prolixus, T. infestans, and
P. geniculatus to a drop of water, a plastic dummy,
and a piece of guava fruit, and found that all
of these objects elicited the fixed action pattern (FAP) associated
with feeding. In the present study, we report for the
first time the occurrence of this behavioral pattern in Belminus
from an ethological perspective, thereby demonstrating the novelty of our
findings.
