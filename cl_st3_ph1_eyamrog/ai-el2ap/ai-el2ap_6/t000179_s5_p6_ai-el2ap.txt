Some items in our scales, specifically those related to professional
activity, health center management, and individual and structural working conditions,
are theoretically comparable to constructs measured by previously published psychometric
instruments. For instance, the 4CornerSAT questionnaire, which assesses physicians’ career
satisfaction, comprises four dimensions—personal, professional, performance, and inherent—that closely correspond
to the dimensions identified in the present study (41, 42).
