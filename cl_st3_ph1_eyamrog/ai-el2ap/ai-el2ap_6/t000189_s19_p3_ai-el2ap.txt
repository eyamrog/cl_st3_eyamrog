The selected studies, published between 2012 and 2018, included participants
from Europe [17], South America [18â€“20], North America [21], and
Asia [22] (Chart 1), comprising a total of 4,352 individuals
(3,388 children and 964 adults and elderly participants) of both
sexes. The participants had diagnoses of community-acquired pneumonia [18,22], acute
upper respiratory tract infections [20], or acute lower respiratory tract
infections [17,21], and some studies focused on predicting clinical symptoms
of viral infections, such as cough with fever [19].
