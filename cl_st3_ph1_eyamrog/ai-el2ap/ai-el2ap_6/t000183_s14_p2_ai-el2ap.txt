This study employed a quasi-experimental, nonequivalent group design, which requires
the administration of both a pretest and a post-test to
compare outcomes between a treatment group and a comparison group.
In this research design, the independent variable is manipulated; however,
participants are not randomly assigned to the experimental conditions.
