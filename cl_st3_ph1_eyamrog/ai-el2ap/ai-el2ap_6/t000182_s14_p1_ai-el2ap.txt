The fifth-instar individuals of Belminus species used in this study
were obtained from laboratory colonies established with insects originally collected
from domiciliary environments in various localities in Colombia (Sandoval et
al. 2004; Galvão and Angulo 2006; Sandoval et al. 2010).
Specifically, B. ferroae specimens were collected in Santa Catalina (07°07′26″N,
72°11′24″) and San Alberto (17°12′40″N, 72°19′12″) in the municipality of
Toledo, Norte de Santander; B. herreri specimens were collected from
a house in the municipality of El Carmen, Santander (6°39′30″N,
73°38′56″) and from dwellings in the municipality of San Martin,
Cesar (07°58′47″N, 73°32′26″); and B. corredori specimens were collected from
a house in San Gil, Santander (6°33′18″N, 73°04′00″). Laboratory colonies
were established in 2000 for B. herreri, in 2002 for
B. corredori, and in 2005 for B. ferroae. The insects
were maintained under laboratory conditions and fed on cockroaches as
described by Sandoval et al. (2013). The Belminus colony has
been maintained at the Venezuelan Institute for Scientific Research (Mérida,
Venezuela) for five years. Rearing conditions were 23 ± 2°C,
82 ± 7% relative humidity, and a 12:12 hour light-dark
cycle. Prior to experimental assays, insects were starved for 8–12
days post-emergence. They were fed fifth-instar nymphs of Blaberus giganteus
(Blaberidae), which were themselves maintained on a diet of canine
food and corn seeds. Belminus individuals and cockroaches were housed
together from hatching for a period of five months. Each
Belminus individual was used only once in experiments to prevent
potential bias due to learning effects (Aldana et al. 2008).
