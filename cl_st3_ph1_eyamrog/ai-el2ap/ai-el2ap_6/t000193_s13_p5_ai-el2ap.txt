After excluding active infection, the subsequent management step involves assessing
the severity of the relapse. For the majority of relapses,
the standard treatment is a 1000 mg intravenous infusion of
methylprednisolone administered over 3â€“5 days. However, evidence indicates that, at
least in cases of optic neuritis, this intervention accelerates neurological
recovery without affecting long-term disability outcomes. Therefore, corticosteroids should be
avoided in the management of mild relapses, as the potential
benefit of more rapid symptom resolution does not outweigh the
increased risk of infection associated with steroid use.
