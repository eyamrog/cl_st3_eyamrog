The results of this study indicate that the diversity of
aquatic Hyphomycetes in insular environments is considerably higher than previously
reported in other studies conducted in the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest.
For example, Schoenlein-Crusius et al. (2009) recorded 24 taxa of
aquatic Hyphomycetes from submerged mixed leaf litter across 10 sampling
sites in the Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga (PEFI),
a remnant of Atlantic Rainforest located in São Paulo State.
Additionally, Fiuza and Gusmão (2011) identified 10 aquatic Hyphomycetes species
in stream foam from Monte da Pioneira, Serra da Jibóia,
in the northern zone of the northeast Atlantic Rainforest.
