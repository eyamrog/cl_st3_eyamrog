With the release of the 2019 Journal Impact Factor (JIF)
by the Journal Citation Reports (JCR), considerable attention was directed
toward journal rankings, particularly following the suppression of Zootaxa, which
generated significant debate among editors and authors. The response was
unusually swift and widespread, with numerous letters of support and
petitions from various societies and researchers urging Clarivate to reconsider
its decision. The suppression of Zootaxa presents several unique aspects
that warrant detailed examination. Some of the supporting letters were
overtly political in tone, while others demonstrated a lack of
understanding or misrepresented the situation as a broader attack on
taxonomy as a scientific discipline. Among the more extreme arguments
was the claim that Zootaxa is currently the only viable
outlet for taxonomic publications, a statement that is demonstrably inaccurate.
In late July, Clarivate issued a brief statement on Twitter
indicating that both Zootaxa and the International Journal of Systematic
and Evolutionary Microbiology would be reconsidered during the regular update
of the JCR scheduled for September. Suppression of journals is
not uncommon and is not exclusive to the Clarivate platform;
most cases are related to allegations of artificial inflation of
impact factors (e.g., Cortegiani et al. 2020). For example, nearly
a decade ago, four Brazilian journals were suppressed following accusations
of citation stacking, a practice involving reciprocal self-citation among a
group of journals (Van Norden 2013). Historically, such cases have
rarely elicited widespread support from the scientific community, except from
those directly involved, possibly indicating a general consensus that the
affected journals merited exclusion. Removal from the JIF effectively excludes
a journal from the competitive pursuit of high-impact academic publishing.
