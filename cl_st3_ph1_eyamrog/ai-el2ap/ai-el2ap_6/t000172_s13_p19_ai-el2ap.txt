Several cellular targets of the coronavirus N protein have been
identified. Cui et al. (2015) demonstrated that the N protein
functions as a viral suppressor of RNA silencing (VSR), as
ectopic expression of the SARS-CoV N protein enhanced MHV-A59 coronavirus
replication in RNA interference (RNAi)-competent cells but not in RNAi-deficient
cells. Additionally, proteomic analyses have revealed that the N protein
interacts with various cellular components, including ribosomal proteins, translation initiation
factors, nucleolar proteins, helicases, and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) (Emmott
et al. 2013). Some interactions, such as those with NONO
and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), may be mediated by RNA, while
interactions with caprin-1, G3BP-1, and G3BP-2, which are associated with
cytoplasmic stress granule formation, are consistent with the observed localization
of N protein within these structures. The interaction between N
protein and nucleolin (NCL) may account for the nucleolar localization
of coronavirus N proteins (Chen et al. 2002). Furthermore, RNA
interference-mediated depletion of specific cellular targets, including NCL, RPL19, and
GSK3, has demonstrated their functional significance in coronavirus replication (Emmott
et al. 2013).
