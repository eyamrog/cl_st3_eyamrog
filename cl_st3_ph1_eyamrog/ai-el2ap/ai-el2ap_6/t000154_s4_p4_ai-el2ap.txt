The growing prevalence of preprints may compromise the feasibility of
double-blind peer review and make open identities increasingly common. However,
to date, no experimental studies have systematically investigated the effects
of transitioning from double-blind to open identity peer review. It
is therefore recommended that scholarly journals employing double-blind peer review
participate in randomized controlled trials to assess the impact of
this transition on the quality and potential bias of the
peer review process.
