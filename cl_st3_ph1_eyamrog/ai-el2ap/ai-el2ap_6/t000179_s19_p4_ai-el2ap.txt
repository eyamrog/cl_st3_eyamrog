The KMO value exceeded 0.90, indicating that the sample size
was adequate for conducting exploratory factor analysis. Parallel analysis supported
a two-factor model, while Kaiser’s criterion suggested a three-factor model;
therefore, both two- and three-factor models were evaluated (see Table
2). In the two-factor model, the item “order in the
health service and labor organization” (variable c2p81_2) exhibited factor complexity,
as its loadings on the first and second factors did
not differ substantially, leading to its exclusion from further analysis.
Additionally, the items related to satisfaction with hours or salary
(c2p81_7), training opportunities (c2p81_10), completion of medical records (c2p81_15), and
respect for patients (c2p81_16) demonstrated very low factor loadings and
were also removed. In the three-factor model, the first factor
was unstable due to the presence of very few items,
resulting in the rejection of this model. Consequently, only the
two-factor model was retained for further analysis, after excluding the
five problematic items identified (c2p81_2, c2p81_7, c2p81_10, c2p81_15, and c2p81_16).
