Spratt, Pulverness, and Williams (2005:21-26) have identified reading as a
receptive skill, indicating that it involves responding to a text
rather than producing one. Reading comprehension is defined as a
complex cognitive process that entails decoding symbols to extract meaning,
which occurs at the levels of individual words, sentences, and
paragraphs. For effective instruction, teachers require a thorough understanding of
the multifaceted nature of reading in order to implement strategies
that facilitate this process for learners. UNESCO previously reported that
third-grade students in several Latin American countries, including Ecuador, were
unable to recognize essential information in simple Spanish texts (LÃ³pez
2009:1-3). This finding was corroborated in 2016, when assessments revealed
that third-grade students in Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, and the Dominican
Republic, among others, continued to demonstrate low reading performance, often
failing to identify key information unless it was explicitly stated
and emphasized in the text.
