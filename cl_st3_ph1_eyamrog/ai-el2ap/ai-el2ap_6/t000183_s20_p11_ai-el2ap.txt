After the intervention, the experimental group demonstrated a significant improvement
in their scores (7.06), indicating that the use of graphic
organizers contributed to enhanced reading comprehension performance. The development of
reading comprehension skills involves the analysis and synthesis of information,
and visual aids such as graphic organizers play an important
role in facilitating these processes (Pearson & Fielding, 1991). From
an educational perspective, several approaches and cognitive processes, particularly those
associated with Bloomâ€™s taxonomy, support the use of graphic organizers.
It is important to consider how these tools correspond to
various stages or levels of cognitive processing when implementing them
in instructional settings.
