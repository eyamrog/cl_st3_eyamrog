The genus Pleiochaeta was described by S. Hughes in 1951,
with Pleiochaeta setosa designated as the type species. Subsequently, five
additional species have been described within this genus. Pleiochaeta is
a dematiaceous fungus characterized by cylindrical-fusiform conidia bearing appendages (Castañeda
Ruíz et al. 1996). This study represents the first report
of this species in Brazil.
