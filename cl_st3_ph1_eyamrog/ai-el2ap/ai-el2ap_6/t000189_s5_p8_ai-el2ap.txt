Although findings regarding vitamin D are heterogeneous, vitamin D deficiency
is recognized as a common nutritional disorder among patients with
respiratory tract infections [34,35]. In a hospital-based retrospective case study,
Inamo et al. (2011) [36] reported that Japanese children (mean
age 14.03Â±11.43 months) with bronchiolitis or pneumonia and vitamin D
deficiency (<10 ng/mL) had a significantly higher requirement for oxygen
and/or ventilatory support (p<0.01).
