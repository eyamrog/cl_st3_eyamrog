The genus Pyramidospora was originally described by Nilsson (1962), with
Pyramidospora casuarinae designated as the type species, which was isolated
from Venezuela. The primary distinguishing characteristic of this genus is
a pronounced constriction in the conidiophore near its junction with
the conidium, resulting in a twisted appearance in this region
(Singh 1972). At present, the genus comprises nine recognized species.
This study represents the first record of the species in
Brazil.
