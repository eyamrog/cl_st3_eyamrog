Only B. herreri exhibited a significant attraction to the black
box containing the cockroach during the first 5-minute period in
the still-air olfactometer, indicating that this species was able to
detect the cockroach under still air conditions at a distance
of 10 cm (78%, arena 2). In contrast, all three
species showed attraction to cockroach odors after one hour. It
is likely that B. corredori and B. ferroae reached the
box containing the cockroach by chance after an extended period
of exploration; however, it is notable that all tested bugs
remained near the box after one hour, suggesting a short-range
attraction effect, although proboscis extension was never observed. The bugs
attempted to climb the box, but the movements and possibly
the strong odors emitted by the cockroach appeared to deter
close contact. This avoidance behavior in Belminus warrants further ethological
and physiological investigation. The observed difference between the initial and
delayed attraction may indicate that cockroaches are not the preferred
host for these species, implying a greater latency in their
response to cockroach-derived cues. It is possible that these Belminus
species utilize different hosts in their natural environments, although current
knowledge of the sylvatic ecology of Belminus is limited. For
future research, we recommend improving the experimental arenas to isolate
olfactory cues from visual stimuli, in order to determine whether
olfaction alone is sufficient to elicit the fixed action pattern.
Additionally, we suggest conducting field studies to sample and observe
Belminus species in their natural habitats, although this presents considerable
logistical challenges.
