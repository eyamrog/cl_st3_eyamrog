By applying Price's Law of Elitism, the elite group of
authors was identified as those corresponding to the square root
of the total number of authors, which in this case
was 82. This elite group accounted for 66.1% of the
documents retrieved, substantially exceeding the minimum threshold of 50% proposed
by the Law of Elitism. It is noteworthy that the
productivity index was relatively low at 1.65, a result primarily
attributable to the high proportion of occasional authors.
