Casanova et al. [25] investigated the effects of air temperature
and humidity on two surrogates of SARS-CoV: transmissible gastroenteritis virus
(TGEV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). These viruses can function
as conservative substitutes for SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses in studies
modeling exposure, transmission risk, and the effectiveness of control measures
for human pathogenic viruses on healthcare surfaces.
