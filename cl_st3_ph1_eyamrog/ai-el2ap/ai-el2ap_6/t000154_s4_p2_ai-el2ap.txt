To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the
first survey to actively recruit and separately analyze the attitudes
of both readers of a journal and members of its
associated learned society. The findings indicate that these stakeholder groups
demonstrate even greater support for open peer review compared to
the journalâ€™s authors and reviewers, which may provide editors of
society journals with additional justification to consider implementing open peer
review practices. Additionally, stakeholders of scholarly journals published by university
departments may exhibit more homogeneous attitudes toward open peer review.
