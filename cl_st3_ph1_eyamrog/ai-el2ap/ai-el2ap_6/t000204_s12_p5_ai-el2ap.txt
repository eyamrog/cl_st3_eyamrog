It is important to recognize that during pandemics, primary attention
is typically directed toward the pathogen itself, its associated biological
risks, preventive measures, containment strategies, and medical treatment protocols. Consequently,
the psychological and psychiatric effects of the pandemic, both at
the individual and collective levels, are often underestimated and insufficiently
addressed (9, 10).
