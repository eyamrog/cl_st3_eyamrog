Both rapid and RT-PCR tests conducted for the detection of
COVID-19 show a relationship with incidence and mortality rates, as
illustrated in Figure 2. At the municipal level, the Pearson
correlation coefficient between the number of rapid tests and the
incidence rate was +0.39, while the coefficient between RT-PCR tests
and the incidence rate was +0.21. For mortality rates, the
correlation coefficients were 0 for rapid tests and +0.12 for
RT-PCR tests.
