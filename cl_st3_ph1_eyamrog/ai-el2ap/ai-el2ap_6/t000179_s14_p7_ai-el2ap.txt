Regarding job satisfaction, all questions and items from the previous
version were retained, albeit with certain modifications. Consequently, a total
of 30 items, organized into three groups corresponding to three
preliminary scales, were included to assess various aspects of job
satisfaction and were evaluated in Questionnaire 2 of ENSUSALUD 2016.
