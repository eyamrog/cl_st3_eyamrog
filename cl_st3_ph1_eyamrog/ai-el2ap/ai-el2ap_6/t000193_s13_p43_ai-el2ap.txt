Accordingly, patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) or neuromyelitis optica spectrum
disorder (NMOSD) who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 should be managed
in accordance with the most recent COVID-19 guidelines. At present,
the standard approach to COVID-19 management is primarily supportive care.
Given that the potential benefits of antiviral agents such as
chloroquine derivatives or remdesivir are not supported by robust evidence,
and that data on their interactions with disease-modifying drugs (DMDs)
are insufficient, their use is not recommended in this patient
population.
