Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, including ocrelizumab and the off-label use of
rituximab, are commonly employed in the treatment of multiple sclerosis
(MS). These agents have been associated with an increased risk
of severe viral infections, which is of particular concern during
the COVID-19 pandemic. Proposed causal mechanisms for this increased risk
include neutropenia, lymphopenia, and hypogammaglobulinemia. Consequently, it is recommended to
monitor complete blood count (CBC) and immunoglobulin levels (total serum
IgA, IgM, and IgG) every six months or in the
event of recurrent infections. Immunoglobulin replacement therapy in patients with
hypogammaglobulinemia has been shown to reduce the risk of infections
associated with rituximab use. This recommendation is especially relevant in
the context of a viral pandemic. Additionally, CD19 monitoring may
be a useful approach to individualize dosing and reinfusion intervals
for B-cell depleting therapies. However, recent studies have not demonstrated
an association between ocrelizumab and severe COVID-19. Therefore, ocrelizumab remains
a reasonable treatment option for patients with aggressive MS and
positive John Cunningham virus (JCV) status.
