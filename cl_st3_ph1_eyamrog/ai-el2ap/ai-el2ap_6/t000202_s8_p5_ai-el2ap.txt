In the context of territorial studies conducted within university settings,
significant contributions have been made in Mexico by Rosas (2002),
Flores et al. (2009), and Bañales (2014). Additionally, although to
a lesser extent, relevant research has also been carried out
on university populations in Chile by Güell, Morales, and Nuñez
(2011); in Colombia by Arango, Castañeda, and Ramírez (2016); and
in Cuba by Gómez, Riverón, Griñan, León, and Yarenis (2017),
among others.
