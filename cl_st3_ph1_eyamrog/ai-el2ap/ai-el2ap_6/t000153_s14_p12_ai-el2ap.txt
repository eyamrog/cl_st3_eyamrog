Unlike studies that examine stigma at the individual level, occupational
stigma arises when negative perceptions are directed toward a particular
profession, subsequently affecting those employed within it. Workers are often
viewed as having voluntarily chosen their occupations, rendering the associated
stigma as “controllable” (Kreiner, Ashforth, and Sluss 2006, p. 619).
In many contexts, the medical profession has attained the status
of a reference point, a position established and sustained through
the accumulation of significant symbolic capital over time. This symbolic
capital can be undermined when information emerges linking medical professionals
to abortion services. As O’Donnell et al. (2011) note, the
fear of stigma also extends to professionals involved in peri-abortion
contexts, including individuals who participate in the abortion process without
directly performing the procedure, such as social workers and those
responsible for counseling, conducting ultrasounds, or overseeing patient recovery. Within
this framework, being labeled an “abortionist” by colleagues carries considerable
negative connotations and can disrupt professional standing. Furthermore, professionals are
also concerned with maintaining their symbolic capital within the family
context (Drovetta 2015a). The stigma associated with abortion is evident,
among other indicators, in the diminished prestige attributed to the
application of medical knowledge acquired during training. O’Donnell et al.
(2011, p. 1358) report that individuals associated with abortion services
are often characterized by stereotypes portraying them as “morally deficient,
profit-motivated, and/or technically incompetent ‘back-alley’ physicians.” Consequently, a stigmatized group
can be defined as “one whose identity or image calls
into question the full humanity of its members; in the
eyes of others, the stigmatized group and its members are
spoiled, blemished, devalued, or flawed to various degrees” (Kreiner, Ashforth,
and Sluss 2006, p. 620).
