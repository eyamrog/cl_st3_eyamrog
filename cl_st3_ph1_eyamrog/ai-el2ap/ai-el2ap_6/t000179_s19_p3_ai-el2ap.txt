The Health Services Management Satisfaction Scale demonstrated a KMO value
greater than 0.90, indicating a high proportion of common variance
among the variables. Parallel analysis suggested the presence of three
potential dimensions, while Kaiser's criterion indicated two dimensions. Given this
heterogeneity, models with one, two, and three dimensions were evaluated.
Both the one-dimensional and two-dimensional models exhibited adequate factor loadings
for physicians (Î» > 0.4) and satisfied the requirement of
having at least three items per dimension (see Table 2).
In contrast, the three-dimensional model displayed considerable heterogeneity, with dimensions
containing fewer than three items each, indicating instability. Consequently, the
three-dimensional model was excluded from further analyses.
