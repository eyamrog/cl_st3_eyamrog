Prior to completing the questionnaire, participants read and accepted the
Participant Consent Form, which outlined the studyâ€™s objectives and procedures,
and informed them of their right to decline to answer
any question or to withdraw from the study at any
time. A total of 1,875 individuals were initially recruited; however,
31 incomplete questionnaires were excluded from the analysis, potentially due
to internet connectivity issues during completion, resulting in a final
sample size of 1,844 participants.
