The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents a potential
risk to individuals with autoimmune disorders, such as multiple sclerosis
(MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). These patients are
commonly treated with immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapies, which may alter
the body's normal immune response to infections. At present, there
is no established consensus regarding the optimal management of MS
and NMOSD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.
