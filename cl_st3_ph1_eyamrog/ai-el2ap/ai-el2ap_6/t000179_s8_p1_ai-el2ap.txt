Job satisfaction is defined as an emotional state or attitude
toward oneâ€™s job, influenced by positive or negative experiences and
by the values or expectations of the worker (1). International
evidence indicates that health workers in higher-ranked positions are more
likely to be psychologically engaged with their work (2). Job
satisfaction is a critical factor in the development of effective
health policies, as it can positively influence health worker performance
and patient satisfaction (3). Conversely, low levels of job satisfaction
among health workers are associated with negative outcomes such as
burnout, increased employee turnover, job changes, and reduced work performance
(4-6). These adverse effects on functioning and quality can undermine
the accountability and resilience of healthcare systems, thereby exacerbating health
disparities both between and within socioeconomic groups (4-6). Consequently, the
assessment of job satisfaction among health workers, including physicians who
frequently serve as team leaders, represents an important consideration for
the global public health agenda.
