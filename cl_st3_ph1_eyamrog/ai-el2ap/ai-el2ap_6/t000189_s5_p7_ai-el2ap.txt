Barbosa et al. [33], in a study of Brazilian children
with and without pneumonia, reported that serum retinol levels were
significantly lower during the inflammatory phase compared to levels measured
after recovery (1.11±0.43 vs. 1.38±0.30 μmol/L; p<0.05). The authors attributed
this reduction to the acute phase response, which is associated
with decreased mobilization of hepatic nutrient reserves and an increased
demand for retinol due to heightened immune cell activity during
pneumonia.
