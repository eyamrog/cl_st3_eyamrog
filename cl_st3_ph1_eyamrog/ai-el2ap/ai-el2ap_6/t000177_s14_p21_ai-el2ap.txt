UV-C radiation possesses a shorter wavelength and higher energy compared
to other types of ultraviolet radiation, which allows it to
be most effective when applied directly and at close range.
The intensity of UV-C radiation follows the inverse square law,
meaning that its intensity decreases proportionally to the square of
the distance from the source. Research conducted by Escombe et
al. [24] and Casanova et al. [25] demonstrated that, provided
there is adequate air circulation within a room to ensure
thorough mixing of air, upper-room UV fixtures can serve as
an effective intervention for infection control in high-risk clinical environments.
