Exploratory analysis of monthly trends over the study period identified
a pattern characterized by two distinct seasonal periods: a low
rainfall season from April to September and a high rainfall
season from October to March. Consequently, the investigation of temporal
associations between exposure (rainfall) and outcome (leptospirosis) in the present
analysis considered both the overall monthly trends and the potential
influence of these two seasonal periods.
