In viral RNA infections, nutraceuticals have been proposed to inhibit
NOX2, thereby restoring TLR7-mediated responses to single-stranded viral RNA and
promoting interferon (IFN) production; additionally, nutraceuticals may upregulate mitochondrial antiviral-signaling
proteins (MAVS) and attenuate pro-inflammatory signaling (McCarty and DiNicolantonio 2020).
In addition to nutraceuticals, vitamins A and D, selenium, zinc,
and probiotics have been reported to enhance immune function and
reduce the risk of respiratory infections, which may be beneficial
for patients with COVID-19 (Grant et al. 2020; Jayawardena et
al. 2020). Therefore, the nutritional status of individuals with COVID-19
warrants further investigation, as it may influence disease progression and
therapeutic outcomes.
