Recent literature reviews on telemedicine in multiple sclerosis (MS) care
have identified benefits in areas such as cost-effectiveness and satisfaction
among both patients and healthcare providers. The Brazilian Academy of
Neurology endorses the use of telemedicine and has published guidelines
for conducting remote neurological examinations. Feasible assessment methods for MS
patients in a telemedicine context include simple tests such as
the timed 25-foot walk, while more complex evaluations, such as
fundoscopic examinations, can be performed when appropriate technological resources are
available. Nevertheless, telemedicine presents certain limitations, particularly regarding long-term treatment
adherence and technological accessibility.
