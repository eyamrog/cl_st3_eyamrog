As a result of a collaboration among Brazilian and international
researchers interested in examining the effects and various psychological states
associated with the rapid global spread of Covid-19, the research
project entitled “Physical, Psychological, and Cognitive Reactions to Covid-19” was
established and subsequently approved by the Research Ethics Committee (CEP)
of the Federal University of Alfenas (UNIFAL-MG) (process number: 4.128.627).
The project is organized into six modules, each designed to
assess a specific dimension of psychological states related to the
Covid-19 pandemic: psychological reactions to pandemics; psychological vulnerability factors; social
isolation; the role of the media and the dissemination of
information about Covid-19; effective strategies for addressing psychological problems; and
the implications for public health policies, including appropriate interventions for
risk communication.
