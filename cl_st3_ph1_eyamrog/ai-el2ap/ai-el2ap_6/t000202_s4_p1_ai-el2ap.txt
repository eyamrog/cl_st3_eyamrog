The student body at the National University of Education of
Ecuador demonstrates a high rate of technological device ownership, with
cell phones being the most prevalent, followed by internet access
and laptops. This widespread access to technological devices does not
appear to be significantly influenced by individual or family socioeconomic
status, as 82% of students belong to the lowest income
segments (56% in quintile 1 and 26% in quintile 2).
These devices serve as the primary tools for information and
communication among UNAE students, who report substantial daily and weekly
usage of videos, the internet, cell phones, and television. Additionally,
there is a generally balanced pattern of device usage across
genders, and the distribution of device use for academic purposes
and social networking is nearly proportional.
