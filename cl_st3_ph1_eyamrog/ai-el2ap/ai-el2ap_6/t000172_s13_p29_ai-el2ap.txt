Protein synthesis pathways are frequently modulated by viruses. Activation of
the PKR pathway by RNA viruses constitutes a significant cellular
defense mechanism, which is often counteracted by various viruses, including
coronaviruses. For instance, dengue virus maintains activation of the cap-dependent
translation machinery during the early stages of infection and subsequently
shifts to a cap-independent mechanism in the later stages by
downregulating p70-S6K, 4E-BP1, and eIF4 factors (Villas-Bôas et al. 2009).
The SARS-CoV ORF3a protein has been shown to induce endoplasmic
reticulum stress and activate eIF2α and PERK, thereby affecting innate
immunity through suppression of type I interferon signaling (Minakshi et
al. 2009). Both PKR and PERK, which promote phosphorylation of
eIF2α and can suppress host translation, are highly expressed during
SARS-CoV replication; however, knockdown of PKR does not impact viral
replication, indicating that SARS-CoV may possess mechanisms to circumvent the
inhibitory effects of phosphorylated eIF2α on viral mRNA translation (Krähling
et al. 2009). Conversely, another study demonstrated that depletion of
the antiviral PKR pathway enhances virus replication, leading to increased
SARS-CoV protein expression and virus production (de Wilde et al.
2015).
