Similar results were observed in public high schools in Ecuador
when the standard of English language proficiency was evaluated. Common
challenges identified in the teaching and learning process included large
class sizes, insufficient teacher training, and a shortage of qualified
teachers, all of which may negatively impact educational outcomes. Despite
efforts to improve English as a Foreign Language (EFL) instruction,
student performance remains relatively low.
