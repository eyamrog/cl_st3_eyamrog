One of the investigators in this study is currently employed
at Unidad Educativa Joaquin Lalama and obtained authorization from the
institution’s administration to conduct the research, which aimed to identify
effective methods for improving students’ reading comprehension in English. Accordingly,
the groups assigned to the researcher during the 2018-2019 academic
period were observed both before and after the intervention. Barreiro
and Albandoz (2001) define a population as the total number
of individuals relevant to a given research problem. As the
total number of students involved in this study was fewer
than 100, the population and sample were treated as equivalent,
comprising a control group of 40 students and an experimental
group of 35 students.
