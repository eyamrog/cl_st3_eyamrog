A randomized controlled study conducted in Israel found no significant
difference in incidence rates among young individuals born three years
before and three years after the discontinuation of their vaccination
program. The authors noted that these findings cannot be used
to evaluate the impact or severity of COVID-19. The conclusions
of this study are consistent with the present results, as
the acceleration of cases did not differ in contexts where
mortality and lethality ratios varied (Table 2). These findings support
the hypothesis that the BCG vaccine does not prevent disease
transmission but may provide protection against severe outcomes.
