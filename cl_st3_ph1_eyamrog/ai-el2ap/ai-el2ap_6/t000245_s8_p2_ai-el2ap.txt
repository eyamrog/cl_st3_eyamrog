The Ganodermataceae family is of significant importance in maintaining trophic
balance within ecosystems, primarily through its role in nutrient cycling
by causing white rot in woody tissues (Ryvarden 2004). Species
within this family possess recognized economic and medicinal value, and
several are notable sources of bioactive compounds that have been
extensively studied for biotechnological applications (Zjawiony 2004, Tseng et al.
2008, Wang et al. 2016).
