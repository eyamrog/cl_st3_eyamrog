Coronaviruses have been recognized as causative agents of respiratory infections
for the past 50 years (1). In December 2019, a
cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown etiology was reported in
Wuhan, China. Subsequent investigations led to the isolation and identification
of a novel coronavirus, designated SARS-CoV-2, which exhibits phylogenetic similarity
to other beta-coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, the agent of severe
acute respiratory syndrome, and MERS-CoV, responsible for Middle East respiratory
syndrome (2). The World Health Organization has since declared COVID-19,
the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a global pandemic (1-3).
