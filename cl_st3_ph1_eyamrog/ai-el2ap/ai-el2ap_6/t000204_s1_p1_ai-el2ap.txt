The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the
causative agent of COVID-19, has significantly impacted various sectors, including
education. Educators and students may experience increased vulnerability during and
after the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. The relationship between educators and students
should be carefully managed due to the potential psychological and
neuropsychiatric effects associated with neural coding and plasticity, which influence
the formation of both positive and negative memories over short
and long-term periods. The pandemic has created a need for
adaptation and heightened attention to students as educational activities resume,
given the possibility of sensory modulation disorders and the involvement
of limbic brain regions in response to perceived threats or
risks to life. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, beyond the imperative
of preserving life, a key challenge is the behavioral reorganization
of educational practices, which should be informed by scientific perspectives
to mitigate the adverse effects of pandemic-related fear and to
strengthen social connections. The pandemic also provides an opportunity to
critically examine the relationship between scientific knowledge and common sense
within the framework of modern rationality. Neuroscience can contribute to
the development of new approaches to the teaching-learning process, aiming
to prevent psychological distress and secondary consequences among educators and
students exposed to pandemic-related stressors. Consequently, education should be recognized
as a central domain for decision-making in response to the
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, underscoring the urgency of developing multidisciplinary strategies that
integrate neuroscience and educational practices in the post-COVID-19 context.
