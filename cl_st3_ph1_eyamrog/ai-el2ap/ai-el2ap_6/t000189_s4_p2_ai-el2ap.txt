Several limitations should be considered when interpreting the presented data.
The inclusion of observational studies may affect the ability to
establish causal relationships. Additionally, the heterogeneity among the selected studies
precluded the calculation of a summary measure through meta-analysis; however,
implementing strategies such as assessing the quality of the included
articles may help mitigate this source of bias. Furthermore, the
lack of original studies specifically addressing nutritional interventions in patients
with COVID-19 limited the scope for inferential analysis.
