The primary threat to taxonomy does not stem from the
exclusion of specific journals from major bibliometric platforms, but rather
from the limited renewal of professional positions and the loss
of important collections, such as those formerly housed at the
Museu Nacional of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.
These factors represent the most significant challenges and should be
the main focus of concern and action within the taxonomic
community. Ultimately, the advancement of taxonomy depends on the work
of taxonomists rather than on the status of journals. While
the emphasis on Journal Impact Factor (JIF) has had a
substantial effect on the careers of taxonomists—largely due to governmental
policies that prioritize bibliometric evaluations in a highly competitive funding
environment—addressing current challenges requires a shift in focus away from
maintaining the existing system. Furthermore, advocating for the reinstatement of
Zootaxa in the JIF rankings without acknowledging the influence of
high self-citation rates on its impact factor is inconsistent. Although
JIF is often regarded as a desirable attribute of Zootaxa,
the use of bibliometric indices in science is governed by
specific rules that may not align with the broader interests
of the field. A more principled approach would be to
reject reliance on bibliometric indices, including JIF, rather than invoking
them selectively. The current system of scientific publishing related to
biodiversity research is facing significant difficulties, particularly for researchers, and
it would be preferable to reimagine this system with a
primary emphasis on supporting diamond open access (DOA) models.
