Associations between variations in leptospirosis rates and seasonal periods were
graphically examined by stratifying the data according to the eight
regions with the highest and lowest leptospirosis rates, as well
as those with the lowest and highest ratios of cases
to rainfall. This approach aimed to identify potential cumulative effects
of rainfall on the incidence of the disease.
