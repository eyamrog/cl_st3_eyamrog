For many vertebrates, chemicals present in feces and urine function
as important signals for territorial marking (Young and Henke 1999;
Brennan 2001). Sylvatic hosts such as opossums, armadillos, and bats,
as well as synanthropic hosts including chickens, dogs, cats, and
rodents, often accumulate excretory products in or near their nesting
sites. Triatomines, as ectoparasites, utilize emanations from such host waste
when searching for resources. Humans are not an exception; triatomine
bugs have been collected in bathrooms, latrines, sewers, and trashcans
in both rural and urban endemic areas (Aldana and Otálora-Luna
2019). Otálora-Luna and Guerin (2014) demonstrated that amines present in
vertebrate waste (i.e., feces and urine) attract Rhodnius prolixus, Triatoma
infestans, and Panstrongylus geniculatus. To the best of our knowledge,
this was the first study to consider host feces as
a source of kairomones indicating a food source for triatomine
bugs. The authors designed their experiments and interpreted their results
based on the hypothesis that triatomines are ectoparasites closely associated
with their hosts, typically sharing the same refuge. In the
present study, guided by an ethological perspective, we selected odor
sources based on our previous ectoparasite hypothesis (Otálora-Luna and Guerin
2014) and our established experimental model involving the observation of
triatomine fixed action patterns (Páez-Rondón et al. 2018). To identify
which chemical stimuli from host excretions elicit the feeding response
in Belminus species, we evaluated the orientation behavior of B.
corredori, B. ferroae, and B. herreri to volatiles produced by
cockroaches, host wastes, and rodent wastes.
