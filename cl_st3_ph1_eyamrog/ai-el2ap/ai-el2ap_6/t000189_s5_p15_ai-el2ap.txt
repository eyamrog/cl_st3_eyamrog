Clinical trials investigating the effects of vitamin D supplementation on
the prevention and severity of respiratory infections have produced heterogeneous
results [40-44], likely due to variations in supplementation protocols, including
differences in vitamin D dosage (ranging from 400 to 100,000
IU administered daily, weekly, or as a single dose) and
intervention duration (ranging from 5 days to 8 months). Nevertheless,
a meta-analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials involving a total
of 10,933 participants demonstrated a protective effect of vitamin D
supplementation against acute respiratory tract infections [45].
