Social Distancing Strategies (SDS) are established measures for controlling the
spread of pandemics and have been implemented during the current
COVID-19 pandemic. Several regions, including China, Italy, Spain, other European
countries, and New York State, have reported successful outcomes following
the adoption of SDS. In this article, we examine indicators
demonstrating that the SDS implemented in SÃ£o Paulo State, Brazil,
since March 16th, have produced measurable outcomes, including a reduction
in mortality and the prevention of health system overload during
the progression of the epidemic. However, data from late April
indicate an upward trend in case numbers, which correlates with
decreased adherence to SDS among the population.
