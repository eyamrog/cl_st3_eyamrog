Yoga- and mindfulness-based interventions have been shown to positively affect
various aspects of physical and psychological well-being, including increased alertness
and positive affect, as well as reduced levels of aggressiveness,
depression, and anxiety (60, 61). One study examining the effects
of mindfulness and yoga on the quality of life of
elementary school students and teachers found that both groups benefited
from the intervention. Specifically, students who participated in the intervention
exhibited significantly greater improvements in psychosocial and emotional quality of
life compared to those who received standard care (62).
