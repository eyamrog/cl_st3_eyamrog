The M protein contains three transmembrane domains and is responsible
for determining the shape of virions by promoting membrane curvature
and binding to the nucleocapsid (Neuman et al. 2011). It
is the most abundant structural protein in the virion, with
a molecular mass of approximately 25â€“30 kDa, and features a
small glycosylated ectodomain at the N-terminus and a larger C-terminal
endodomain that extends 6 to 8 nm into the viral
particle (Nal et al. 2005). Within the virion, the M
protein forms dimers and can adopt two distinct conformations, enabling
interactions with both the nucleocapsid N protein and the S
protein (Neuman et al. 2011). The interaction with the N
protein is essential for complete virion assembly and occurs between
the C-terminal region of the M protein endodomain and the
C-terminal domain (CTD) of the N protein (Hurst et al.
2005). Additionally, interaction between the M protein and the E
protein has been demonstrated (Chen et al. 2009a). The M
protein mediates the majority of protein-protein interactions required for coronavirus
assembly. However, expression of the M protein alone is insufficient
for the formation of virus-like particles (VLPs) (Bos et al.
1996). Co-expression of the M and E proteins results in
VLP formation, indicating the critical roles of both proteins in
the production of coronavirus envelopes. Furthermore, the surface proteins S,
M, and E exhibit differential subcellular localization when expressed individually,
suggesting that additional cellular or viral factors are required for
their coordinated trafficking to the viral assembly site in the
endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (Nal et al. 2005).
