Patients with severe COVID-19 are at increased risk of developing
neurological complications, such as acute cerebrovascular diseases, impaired consciousness, seizures,
encephalopathy, and skeletal muscle injury. These complications may occur following
the onset of respiratory symptoms and are potentially mediated by
an exaggerated immunological response. Immune-mediated damage and prothrombotic states associated
with the cytokine storm observed in COVID-19 may contribute to
the development of neurological symptoms. This process may involve the
activation of glial cells, leading to demyelination. Additionally, there have
been anecdotal reports of central nervous system demyelinating events following
SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the association between SARS-CoV-2 and post-infectious inflammatory
demyelinating events remains under investigation.
