As authors of papers on various zoological taxa, editors of
special issues, and reviewers of manuscripts submitted to Zootaxa over
the past ten years, we are well positioned to provide
an informed assessment of the journal and its influence within
the field of taxonomy. Zootaxa has become a significant platform
for the publication of new zoological names, contributing substantially to
advancements in taxonomic research.
