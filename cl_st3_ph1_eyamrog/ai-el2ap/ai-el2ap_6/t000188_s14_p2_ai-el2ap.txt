The study included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 deaths from
the first recorded death until May 15, 2020. COVID-19 cases
were defined as those with a positive result for viral
nucleic acid testing in respiratory specimens or a positive serological
test. Data were obtained from the official website reporting the
COVID-19 situation in Brazil. Model development data were updated as
of May 16, 2020. Cumulative case rates per 1,000,000 inhabitants
were calculated by dividing the number of COVID-19 deaths in
each state by the population at risk, based on state
population estimates provided by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and
Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat√≠stica, IBGE).
