Epidemics can place significant demands on intensive care resources and
may necessitate the rapid expansion of intensive care capacity. However,
few intensivists have direct experience in scaling up intensive care
services in response to such events. Early preparedness measures should
include fit testing of negative pressure respirators, training of reserve
personnel, procurement of materials required for physical modifications to the
intensive care unit, and other relevant actions [7].
