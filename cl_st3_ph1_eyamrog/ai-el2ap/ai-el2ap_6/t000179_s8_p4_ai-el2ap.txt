Based on the considerations outlined above, the objective of this
study was to evaluate the evidence of validity and reliability
for a set of scales measuring different domains of job
satisfaction—specifically, general professional activity, health services management, and working conditions—among
Peruvian physicians, using data from the National Survey of Satisfaction
of Users in Health (ENSUSALUD). The findings of this study
may contribute to the improvement of measurement tools related to
physician job satisfaction in Peru and provide baseline information to
inform the development of public policies concerning human resources in
healthcare.
