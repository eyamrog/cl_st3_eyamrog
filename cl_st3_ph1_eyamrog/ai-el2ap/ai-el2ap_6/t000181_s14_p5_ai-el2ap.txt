Fear was assessed using the Covid-19 Fear Scale (FCV-19S), a
seven-item unidimensional instrument presented in a five-point Likert format (strongly
disagree, disagree, neither agree nor disagree, agree, strongly agree). The
FCV-19S has demonstrated robust psychometric properties, with a reported Cronbach’s
alpha of 0.82, indicating good internal consistency, and has been
shown to be both reliable and valid for measuring fear
related to Covid-19 (Ahorsu et al., 2020). Total scores on
the scale range from 7 to 35, with higher scores
indicating greater levels of fear; scores are categorized as normal
(7–16), mild to moderate (17–26), and severe (27–35).
