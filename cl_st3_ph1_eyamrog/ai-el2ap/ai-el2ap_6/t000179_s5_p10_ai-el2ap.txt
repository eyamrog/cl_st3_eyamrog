Healthcare systems worldwide are currently facing significant challenges due to
demographic, political, economic, and social changes, which have resulted in
substantial transformations that threaten the capacity of many organizations to
effectively promote and protect population health. Many healthcare systems are
also experiencing difficulties in maintaining their operations. Addressing these challenges
requires the presence of committed and productive teams, including physicians
who collaborate with organizational leaders and the broader community. Monitoring
job satisfaction is an important aspect of ensuring workforce stability
and effectiveness; however, most existing measurement instruments are outdated, limited
in scope, or lack appropriate cultural adaptation for use in
diverse international contexts. To support the sustainability and protective function
of healthcare systems in promoting and maintaining population health and
wellbeing, it is essential to adequately assess and address job
satisfaction among healthcare professionals.
