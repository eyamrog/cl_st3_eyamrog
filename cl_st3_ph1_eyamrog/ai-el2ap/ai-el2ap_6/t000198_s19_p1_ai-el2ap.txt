Following the World Health Organization's declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic,
the Federal University of Para√≠ba suspended all in-person teaching, research,
and service activities. In preparation for the resumption of academic
activities, the university recommended the use of information and communications
technology (ICT) resources to facilitate distance learning, taking into account
factors such as student access to the internet and computers,
teacher training in the use of ICTs, and the theoretical
or practical nature of curricular components. Remote instruction for theoretical
curricular components was implemented across all undergraduate programs; however, these
courses were classified as part of a supplementary semester. Assessments
were administered online in various formats, including quizzes, essays, and
video production. Upon the return to in-person activities, and in
recognition of the fact that some students lack adequate socioeconomic
resources to support the use of ICTs, the university mandated
that curricular components previously offered online be made available again
in the classroom setting.
