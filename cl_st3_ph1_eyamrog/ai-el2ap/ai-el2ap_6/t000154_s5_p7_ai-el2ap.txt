Double-blind review is fundamentally incompatible with the use of preprints,
particularly in cases where journals themselves deposit pre-review manuscripts on
preprint servers such as SciELO Preprints or EmeRI. This incompatibility
is especially evident with EmeRI, which actively encourages preprint readers
to volunteer as reviewers for the corresponding journals, thereby facilitating
open participation. In contrast, other aspects of open peer review
are not inherently at odds with double-blind review: open reports
do not necessarily require disclosure of reviewer identities, open interactions
can be anonymized through editorial platforms such as OJS 3,
decoupled peer review can be conducted in a double-blind manner,
and open commenting on the final published version serves as
a supplement rather than a replacement for traditional peer review.
