Graphic organizers for reading are classified as graphic strategies. Although
numerous types exist, the most commonly used are concept maps,
mind maps, webs, and Venn diagrams. Based on previous research
and their demonstrated practicality, the following graphic organizers were selected
for this study: the K-W-L chart (Know, Want to know,
Learned), the K-W-L-S chart (Know, Want, Learned, Still), the BRS
chart (Building and Revising Schema), the Sixty Second Skim and
Scan, the Cluster Web, the Concept Web, Alphabet Brainstorming, the
Questioning Cluster, and the B-D-A Connection Chart (Before, During, and
After reading). Examples of these organizers are presented in Figure
