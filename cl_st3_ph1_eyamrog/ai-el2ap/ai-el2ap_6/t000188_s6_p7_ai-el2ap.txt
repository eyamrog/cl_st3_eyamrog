In addition to prevention and diagnosis, the prediction of COVID-19-related
mortality is valuable for hospital management, particularly in allocating resources
for patients who develop severe forms of the infection. A
study conducted in Brazil found that health regions with the
highest mortality rates from hypertension, neoplasms, diabetes, cardiovascular, and respiratory
diseases are also those with limited availability of intensive care
unit beds and mechanical ventilators.22 These findings indicate that effective
planning and equitable distribution of healthcare resources are essential for
addressing the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil. Failure to implement such
measures may result in further strain on the healthcare system
and an increase in mortality rates.
