For São Paulo State, excluding São Paulo City, the progression
is presented in Figure 4. The data indicate a marked
increase in the number of deaths until April 5th, with
an average rate of 2.1 deaths per day, which represents
approximately two-thirds of the rate observed in São Paulo City.
This initial rise is followed by a period of stabilization
lasting until April 18th, after which a subsequent increase in
deaths is observed.
