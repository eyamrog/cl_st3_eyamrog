In Latin America, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations (FAO) promotes the development of school feeding programs
to improve child nutrition. In the United States, there are
at least two major programs targeting vulnerable children: the School
Nutrition Program, which provides free meals to children from low-income
families, and the Farmers Market Nutrition Program (FMNP), a supplementary
nutrition initiative for women, infants, and children. Additionally, the World
Food Program (WFP) is a significant global initiative that provides
meals and snacks to approximately 17.3 million school children worldwide
[WFP].
