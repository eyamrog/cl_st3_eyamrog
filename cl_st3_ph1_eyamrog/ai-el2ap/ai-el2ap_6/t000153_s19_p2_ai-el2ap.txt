Overall, the formation of the Network resulted from the efforts
of civil society and women's organizations that maintained a significant
territorial presence and established collaborations with local professionals. Notably, “Catholics
for the Right to Decide” was among these organizations, having
engaged in educational and awareness-raising activities for more than a
decade prior to the establishment of the Network.
