Discontinuation of disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) is not recommended for patients
who are already receiving treatment. Cessation of fingolimod and natalizumab
has been associated with disease rebound, which may result in
increased disability, hospitalization, and the need for additional immunosuppressive therapies
such as intravenous methylprednisolone. These factors may consequently increase the
risk of severe COVID-19 infection in affected patients.
