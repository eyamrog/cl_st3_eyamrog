Batelaan et al. (31) reported that anxiety disorders are associated
with a 52% increase in the incidence of cardiovascular diseases,
and that the severity of anxiety symptoms is directly related
to functional impairment (32). These findings are consistent with evidence
indicating that the body initiates adaptive responses to maintain homeostasis,
which are mediated by neuroendocrine and neuronal mechanisms involving the
autonomic nervous system and activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis,
resulting in the release of cortisol. Dysregulation of this axis
can alter the physiological response to stress, thereby contributing to
the development of anxiety disorders (33).
