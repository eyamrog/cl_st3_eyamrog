Health Services Management Satisfaction Scale: This scale is designed to
assess the effectiveness of the facilityâ€™s management team in operating
and organizing the healthcare facility. The items included in this
scale measure satisfaction with various aspects of management, including resource
management (both economic and human), drug management, shift scheduling, and
work capacity. In the ENSUSALUD survey, the items corresponding to
this instrument are found in question 83, with codes ranging
from c2p83_1 to c2p83_8 (see Supplement 1).
