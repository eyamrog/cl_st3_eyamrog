During the COVID-19 pandemic, most patients at both Hospital das
Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo
and Faculdade de Ciências Médicas da Santa Casa de São
Paulo have been contacted via telephone and/or email. This approach
has facilitated direct communication between patients and healthcare providers for
the purposes of rescheduling appointments, reviewing laboratory and imaging results,
addressing patient complaints, managing and monitoring medications, and disseminating information
related to the pandemic.
