The significance of aquatic anamorphs has been particularly noted in
lotic environments, such as streams characterized by well-aerated, clean, and
moderately turbulent waters, where their conidia are dispersed in foams
or associated with decaying organic substrates (Ingold 1975). Although primarily
associated with these aquatic habitats, some aquatic anamorphs have also
been detected in terrestrial environments, including the roots of various
plants such as grasses and riparian ferns (Sati & Belwal
2005), as well as in lentic waters (Suzuki & Nimura
1961; Casper 1965) and, more recently, in urban and eutrophic
waters (Schoenlein-Crusius et al. 2009; Schoenlein-Crusius et al. 2014).
