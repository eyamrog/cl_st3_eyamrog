Zootaxa does not meet the previously outlined criteria that would
reasonably justify its high rate of self-citation, and the proportion
of self-citations in the journal has increased over time (Figure
4). The journal is not highly specialized, as evidenced by
a review of its issues, and the field of taxonomy
is served by a substantial number of journals, contrary to
the notion that only a few outlets are available for
most taxonomic groups. Specifically, we identified 123 journals indexed in
the JCR database that publish taxonomic papers (Table 1), indicating
a wide range of publication options for descriptive taxonomy (Figures
1–2). If Zootaxa were truly specialized, it would be expected
that journals with a narrower taxonomic focus, such as Odonatologica
(dragonflies) and Acarologia (mites), would exhibit similar or higher self-citation
rates; however, this is not observed (Figures 1–2, 5). Similarly,
journals specializing in highly diverse groups, such as beetles, bees,
moths, and butterflies, do not display elevated self-citation rates (Figures
2, 5). Even regionally focused journals, such as Neotropical Ichthyology
and South American Journal of Herpetology, have significantly lower self-citation
levels. Therefore, the broad taxonomic scope of Zootaxa does not
account for its high self-citation rate. Instead, the explanation likely
lies in other aspects specific to the journal, as discussed
previously. Notably, the majority of citations to the analyzed journals
originated from Zootaxa itself (Figures 1–3).
