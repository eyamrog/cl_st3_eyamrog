Based on the observation and comparison of the low pre-test
scores—4.05 for the control group and 4.14 out of 10
for the experimental group—it can be inferred that students exhibit
low motivation when reading, which may be attributed to a
lack of effective strategies for text comprehension. These findings informed
the decision to implement graphic organizers as an intervention aimed
at improving students' reading comprehension.
