Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous studies investigated the impact
of school meal programs on student outcomes. Existing research has
demonstrated that school feeding programs can have positive effects on
the development of verbal fluency in malnourished children [13]. Furthermore,
Jomaa, McDonnell, and Probart [14] conducted a bibliographic review of
articles published over a 20-year period, analyzing the effects of
school feeding programs on children and adolescents. Their findings indicated
that participation in school meal programs was associated with improved
student enrollment and reduced dropout rates compared to students who
did not participate in such programs.
