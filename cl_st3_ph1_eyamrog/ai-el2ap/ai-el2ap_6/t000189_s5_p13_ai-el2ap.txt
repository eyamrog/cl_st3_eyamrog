A Cochrane review conducted by Chen et al. [39] evaluated
the effects of both megadose (100,000–206,000 IU/day) and low-dose (5,000
IU/day, 8,333–10,000 IU/week, or 20,000–45,000 IU every two months) vitamin
A supplementation in children aged 0 to 7 years. The
review found no significant beneficial effects of vitamin A supplementation
in this population, and some studies included in the review
reported a worsening of clinical symptoms such as cough with
fever, tachypnea, and an increased incidence of acute respiratory infections
among children receiving supplementation. The authors noted that any potential
benefits of vitamin A supplementation may be more pronounced in
children with pre-existing malnutrition. They concluded that low-dose vitamin A
supplementation is associated with fewer side effects and provides benefits
comparable to those observed with megadose supplementation.
