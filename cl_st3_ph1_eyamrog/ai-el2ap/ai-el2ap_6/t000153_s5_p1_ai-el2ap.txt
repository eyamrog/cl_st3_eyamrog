From the perspective of healthcare professionals, one of the primary
motivations for establishing the Network was the need to reconsider
the role of healthcare providers in addressing the needs of
women experiencing unplanned pregnancies. A significant gap was identified in
their pre-professional training, specifically regarding the skills and knowledge required
to support women and girls seeking abortion services within the
public health system. Although the professionals demonstrated a willingness to
provide solutions, they generally lacked familiarity with available methods such
as medical abortion and were not well informed about recent
legal and regulatory developments related to abortion provision (Drovetta 2015a,
2015b). Notable among these developments are the Action Protocols in
the Guide for the Improvement of Post Abortion Care (2005),
the Guide for Non-Punishable Abortion Integral Care (2010), and the
Protocol for Integral Care of People with the Right to
a Legal Interruption of Pregnancy in Argentina (2015), all issued
by the Ministry of Health of Argentina.
