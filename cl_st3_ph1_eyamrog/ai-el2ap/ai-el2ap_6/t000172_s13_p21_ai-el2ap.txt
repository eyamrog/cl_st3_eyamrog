Coronavirus ORF7a has been identified as a type I interferon
(IFN) antagonist, but only in the presence of the ORF3
protein, thereby contributing to viral protection against the antiviral state
induced by this cytokine (Dedeurwaerder et al. 2014). The ORF7a
protein also interacts with bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST-2,
also known as tetherin), an antiviral factor that restricts SARS-CoV
infection, by inhibiting its glycosylation; loss of ORF7a results in
significantly increased restriction of viral replication (Taylor et al. 2015).
Additionally, ORF7a expression has been linked to cell cycle arrest
at the G0/G1 phase in HEK 293 cells through the
cyclin D3/pRb pathway (Yuan et al. 2006). Further research has
shown that translation of SARS-CoV ORF7b may occur via leaky
ribosomal scanning, and that the resulting protein localizes to the
Golgi compartment and is incorporated into viral particles (Schaecher et
al. 2007). Moreover, evidence suggests that SARS-CoV ORF8 may have
originated through recombination with SARS-related coronaviruses from bats, which could
influence animal-to-human transmission dynamics (Lau et al. 2015).
