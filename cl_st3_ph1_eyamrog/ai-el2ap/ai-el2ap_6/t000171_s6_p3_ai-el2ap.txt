Adda J (2016) reported that the spread of influenza viruses
in the twentieth century was closely linked to human mobility,
with a strong association observed between disease transmission and factors
such as economic activity and the availability of long-distance transportation.
This relationship was further supported by Candido D et al.
(2020), who found that increased air travel distances were correlated
with a greater spread of COVID-19. Given the similarities in
transmission mechanisms, it is anticipated that the spread of SARS-CoV-2
would follow a comparable pattern. Jia et al. (2020) provided
evidence from China demonstrating a strong association between population movement
across regions and disease incidence rates. Additionally, their analysis indicated
that while gross domestic product (GDP) and population size initially
serve as predictors of disease spread, their predictive value diminishes
over time, suggesting a subsequent shift of the virus to
regions with varying economic profiles, including less affluent areas.
