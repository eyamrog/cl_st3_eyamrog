Although intravenous steroids are the standard treatment for multiple sclerosis
(MS) relapses, evidence indicates that oral corticosteroids can achieve comparable
efficacy. Given that oral corticosteroids can be administered without compromising
social distancing measures, this approach should be considered as a
treatment option during the pandemic. We recommend administering custom-compounded oral
methylprednisolone at a dose of 1000 mg per day for
five days. In settings where oral formulations are unavailable, such
as is frequently the case in Brazil, intravenous methylprednisolone at
1000 mg daily for five days is advised, preferably within
a day hospital setting. For patients with contraindications to high-dose
corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin at a total dose of 2 g/kg
over 2 to 5 days is an appropriate alternative.
