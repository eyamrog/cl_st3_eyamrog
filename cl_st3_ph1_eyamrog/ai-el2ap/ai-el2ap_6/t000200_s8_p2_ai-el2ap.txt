In Brazil, leptospirosis is an endemic disease that becomes epidemic
during periods of heavy rainfall or major climatic events such
as flooding. The disease disproportionately affects low-income populations residing in
rodent-infested, flood-prone slums, which are primarily located in capital cities
and metropolitan areas. The magnitude of risk is determined by
the local prevalence of leptospirosis as well as the degree
and frequency of exposure.
