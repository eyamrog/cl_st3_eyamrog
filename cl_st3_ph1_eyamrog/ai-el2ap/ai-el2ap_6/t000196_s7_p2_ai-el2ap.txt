As of April 2020, school closures due to the COVID-19
pandemic affected approximately 197 countries and 1.6 billion children and
adolescents [4]. Of these, an estimated 352 million students are
no longer receiving meals at school, which for many constituted
their primary source of daily nutrition [4]. Several countries with
large numbers of students who regularly benefit from school meal
programs have been particularly impacted, including India (approximately 90.4 million),
Brazil (40.1 million), the United States (30 million), Egypt (11
million), Nigeria (9.8 million), South Africa (9.2 million), Turkey (6.1
million), Colombia (4 million), Peru (2.3 million), Bolivia (2.3 million),
Ethiopia (2.5 million), and Argentina (1.6 million) [1].
